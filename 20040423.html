<dd>ANNOUNCEMENT!<br><br>Fox is working with EMI in the <br>UK in the interest of putting out <br>an official Angel music <br>soundtrack album.<br><br>In the last few years, websites <br>like BuffyDownUnder have <br>hosted threads taking requests <br>from fans on a soundtrack <br>album's content, if there ever <br>were one (Fox wasn't interested <br>back then).<br><br>Also, in the last few weeks, <br>CityofAngel.com has hosted <br>request taking.<br><br>It's been a lot of hard work <br>editing things down to one CD, <br>but the end result at this point is <br>76 minutes of music!<br><br>Please note that Fox is wanting <br>it to be a soundtrack album, not <br>a songs album. However at this <br>point it looks like Andy Hallett <br>will have at least one song, and <br>the LA song from David <br>Greenwalt will also be onboard.<br><br>Darling Violetta's main titles <br>theme is definite.<br><br>There's a ton of material: a 5 <br>minute track devoted to "Hero", <br>lots of Darla music and LOTS of <br>PYLEA music, Fred's theme, lots <br>of action and also heartfelt stuff <br>like Princess Cordellia and the <br>music from the end of "Home".<br><br>I'll try to post a list <br>somewhere...probably <br>CityofAngel.<br><br>Anyway, wish it well: it's now up <br>to EMI in the UK to approve it. It <br>will probably undergo further <br>changes, but here's hoping for <br>an approval so you can all have <br>the album!<br><br>
