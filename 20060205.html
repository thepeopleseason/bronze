<dd>Hey, <b>Beldin</b>:  =)<br><br><b>AngelicSlayer23</b>:  Hi, there!  Well, thanks for the support, even though you can't make it.  =)  As for the SuperBowl, I haven't been paying much attention, as I've been in rehearsals pretty much daily - we actually are rehearsing all day today, too (I have to leave shortly). But if pressed, I'd say I'm rooting for the Steelers, if for no other reason that they're an old-school team from the East.  Yay, Pittsburgh!  ;-)<br><br>
