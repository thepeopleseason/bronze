<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  Yes, the sun started to shine here a few days ago, (Tuesday, I think), and it's been lovely weather since!  Sorry about the snow...unless you don't have to drive anywhere, in which case, I always thought the snow was beautiful!  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>  Thank you so very much!  It should be a very fun evening, and I'm sure we'll be able to raise a good amount of money for the SPC.  =)<br><br>

<dd>Thanks, <b>Glow Boy!</b><br><br><b>Beldin:</b>  Jeff's great, thanks!  Yes, indeed, spending loads of quality time in the studio.  Finishing up the EP he's releasing with the UK act, "Ashfelt."  (It'll be half VC remixes and instrumental tracks, and half Ashfelt stuff.)  He had planned on releasing it in December, but he's such a perfectionist/mad scientist, he just keeps tinkering with the mixes!  (They're awesome, I must say...)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>slayerdaddy!</b>  Nope. I believe it's purely cash (or checks) at the show.  However, if I discover tonight that I am mistaken, and there is another way for you to donate, I'll be sure to let you know!  =)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys!  I know this is totally last-minute notice, but here goes, anyway:<br><br><b>***Erika of Velvet Chain to sing in Benefit Concert***</b><br><br>For the past 4 years, my wonderful friend Darin Sanone has been raising money for various charities and organizations through a benefit concert he created called <b>ABRACADABARET</b>. I am extremely pleased to be one of the performers participating in this year's show to raise money for the <b>Suicide Prevention Center Crisis Hotline</b>. (It's a wonderful organization; they save lives every day!) The benefit - <b>ABRACADABARET IV</b> - will be held on Sunday, Jan.16th, (TONIGHT) at 7:00 p.m. at Rage nightclub in West Hollywood. <a href="http://images.ofoto.com/photos977/2/32/99/30/20/4/420309932203_0_ALB.jpg" target="_blank">Abracadabaret Flier</a>  There is no cover charge to attend this event. Donations are gratefully accepted, but are not mandatory and are completely voluntary. Just come out and support the wonderful group of performers Darin has put together! =) However, if you do wish to donate, please know that 100% of all the donations will go directly to SPC. (And of course, all of the artists are donating their time and talents.) Please come and enjoy the show! <br><br>Thank you so much! Hope to see you there! <br><br>xoxo <br><br>Erika <br><br>Rage is located at 8911 Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood. The cross street is San Vicente. <br><br>P.S. New info for the show tonight: it is a very casual, club atmosphere, so you can show up at any time during the two hours or so that we'll all be performing. Darin (the organizer) has now decided to put me toward the latter part of the show, so I'm guessing I'll go on around 8pm or later.  I will be performing "Treason."<br><br>Also, I will be selling our CD's there at a discounted rate and will be donating half of the purchase price to the Suicide Prevention Center Crisis Hotline.<br><br>Thanks a bunch!<br><br>~Erika<br><br>
