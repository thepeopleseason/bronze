<dd>THOIN: Thanks for the <br>compliments on the music <br>(thanks to everyone else too!).<br><br>Re: Themes: obviously we didn't <br>want to get too "Hollywood" with <br>this...and just support the <br>emotions, leave lots of silence <br>etc.<br><br>But there is a theme that plays <br>once in "A Hole IN the World": <br>when Fred says "I walk with <br>heroes", Wes says "You are <br>one", around that point Fred's <br>theme from Pylea comes in for <br>her dialog about gaining <br>strength. IN Pylea it used to play <br>on recorder, here it's on a very <br>soft piano.<br><br>
