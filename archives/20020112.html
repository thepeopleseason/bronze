<dd>Special return just for DowtownApartments:  Hey, we keep missing each other!  Coming to the PBP?  Why, of course you are!  What else are you going to do with your hard earned cash?<br><br>Now I'm really gone.  Poof and again poof!<br><br>

<dd>Slaughteredlamb:  You have fine taste.  And now a little secret, just for you.  I was on 90210 as an extra the first season.  Something special if you tell me what episode and who I played.<br><br>The Net Slayerette… is a YAY.<br><br>Angel Rain: That’s a slight breach of etiquette.  Stick out your tongue.<br><br>AmberBensonFan:  You’re very welcome.  <br><br>Tralfamadore2045:  Ah!  No pants!  Of course!  You’re a true genius!  And I don’t wear jammies.<br><br>Xanderella:  Still working on post for Dead Things.  Can’t say a word.  Nope.  But I think you’re gonna like it…<br><br>Allyson:  I’m seldom serious, as I’m sure you can tell.  Of course you can complain about the show.  Heck, I complain about shows I love all the time.  Just hope you’ll keep watching, is all.<br><br><br>And with that, I’m off like a pair of hula boxers.  Sorry if I missed any questions.  Love, pokes, and little more love for all you fine people.  Poof-itty poof poof poof.<br><br>

<dd>Tiggy!!!:  Got your e.  Passing your request along.  Sunday sounds great, as long as it’s not too early.  I already penciled in a hangover that morning.<br><br>Huggybuffy: Damn John Law!  I gotta be free to be you and me!  Oh, wait, maybe just me.<br><br>Evalie:  No censors at UPN.  Just a lot of love-starved monkeys, like us.<br><br>Natasaha:  NoCal, eh?  If I’m not working, perhaps I might.  Send Tiggy an e and she’ll forward it to me (cause she’s the best).<br><br>

<dd>OldManFan:  Just the usual spoilers from me.  Everybody dies.   The Powers That Be fly off in a space ship that oddly resembles a firefly…<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Yes, I have seen Tralf’s clay figure of me.  See below.  And oh!  Now YOU have the right attitude towards smut!  People, fellow this sane, heart-felt position on the subject.<br><br>Scourge:  I’m off the good stuff.  AFI awards, that’s all I’m saying.<br><br>Tralfamadore2000:  Loved the clay figures.  Just one question: what the hell am I doing a bathroom?  You been spying on me again?!<br><br>AndeeH:  Yes, I saw the BBC interview.  I really cracked myself up.  I thought, “Ouhhh!  Who’s the geek?”  My friends are still ribbing me about it.<br><br>

<dd>Ah, I see it's Friday and the natives are restless.  I'll strap on my crash helmet for a few minutes and dive right in.<br><br>AB:  I take serious offense to you comments.  Why, our smut is never cheap!  It's the finest smut available on the European market.  Kudos to UPN for not skimping on the good stuff.<br><br>Allyson:  I'd love to respond to your comments, but, quite honestly, I've never seen an episode of Buffy.  I'm far too busy pouring over my treasured collection of 90210 bootlegs.  I'll pass along your comments, though.  I'm sure some one around here must watch it.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  Hey, sweety.  If your Mom's a member of DeKnight's Riders, where's her pic?  Have her send one to Tiggy.<br><br>
