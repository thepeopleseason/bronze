<dd>Kiba is the goddess who directed me to the post, thank you Keebs.  I gotta run away now.  But here's a little Firefly sneak:  Nathan and Alan are right now recording a duel commentary on War Stories for the DVD.  It's gonna be so large....    see ya     -j.<br><br>

<dd>Now that that's clear, I will add that I'm very hopeful, we're working hard to make it happen, and as soon as anything is decided you'll know.  Probably before I do, knowing you guys.<br><br>ps Didn't Tim's ep kick buns?<br><br>

<dd>OKAY!  for the first time ever, someone pretended to be me with some measure of success!  Congratulations.  Here's exactly what came of it:  the brass at the WB saw the post, thought it was me, and got wicked pissed off.  The fact is, they are still deciding the schedule, and Angel's future is still in doubt.  Making them angry at this stage is, shall we say, unhelpful.  Hopefully my colorfulness will make it clear I'm me, I don't have time for the usual funny.<br><br>

<dd>Adri, thanks.<br><br>C. Marlowe, that was pretty funny.  ;)<br><br>OzLady, night.  Sounds like quite a week.<br><br>Kaymyth, Ghosts of Albion finished up today (though the message board "drama" is still going on for a while).  Of course we're hoping it's just the beginning.  There are plans in the offing.<br><br>Wolfie, it must have been a while.  I don't actually remember what we're talking about.  :)<br><br>And on that note, good night folks.  I'm gone.<br><br>Be well.<br><br>

<dd>OzLady . . . gotta get all that innuendo out of your system.  It's what I'm here for.<br><br>Willowspike, thanks!<br><br>Wolfguard, dogtrot, how's it going?<br><br>ValMichael . . . the Buffy fiction program is NOT ending.  Not by a long shot.  However, aside from a novella I did for the upcoming Tales ofthe Slayers 3, I have no further plans for BtVS fiction.<br><br>Kaymyth . . . Awww.  :)<br><br>OMF, thanks.<br><br>C. Marlowe, was that a good thing?  The readership is divided.  :)<br><br>
