<dd>Whoops.  Can't stay and talk.  Gotta go "work" (by that I mean, gotta go down to the set and eat free food and watch Tom Lenk sing gangster rap songs in his opera voice -- which is not a spoiler, don't worry.  It's just something Tom does in his spare time.  Next time you see him, ask him to do it.  You won't be sorry.)<br><br>But a little later today, do you guys want to have what the kids call a "heart-to-heart"?  We could tell stories, ask each other questions, make lists of people we hate, eat pizza, and play that communications game I saw on The Real World where we talk about who we would kill if we were stranded in a lifeboat together and then we could all cry and hug and continue to have unprotected sex until we have a really good pregnancy scare and then apparently sleep with Frank -- Frank! -- and then throw spoons at each other and wonder where our lives went wrong.<br><br>I'm thinking like 5-ish.<br><br>
