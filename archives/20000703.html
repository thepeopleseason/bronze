Well, unlike my small, cramped apartment in LA where i can be online and on phone at same time, Mom's house just doesn't afford such luxuries, and I need to use the phone before it gets too late, so I am signing off---sorry i did not get to everyone's questions--but to quote someone we all know and love--"I'll be back."  Thanks again for all the kind comments--now that I am signing off, you can get back to your truthful ways and drill me....night all--mb

The movie was called Summer Catch, sorry i forgot to give the title to you all..yes i am enjoying the down time, but can't wait to get back to work on the show, even though it is only for 3 episodes..i guess the workaholic in me is restless...i am actually no where near the liberty bell in phily...many many miles away, but will have fun in my neck of the woods--speaking of atlanta, there is a slim chanace i will be there next week for the baseball all-star game...i am hoping i get a chance to go...again, for me to go in sept, i would need James to ask me nicely...

sorry i am way behind on answering some questions...the movie in Southport NC went very well--we had a great time--i hope the movie is good--i look forward to you all's opinion--i think.  I have no plans to go to Toronto with James, but if James were to ask me nicely....
