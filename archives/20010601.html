I'd post a link, but hey, I'm a butt monkey.<BR>

<DD>Xanderella: Yeah, all the writers cried like babies when we saw a rough cut of ep. 100.  And it wasn't even finished!  Buffy makes me cry more than any other show I've ever watched.  Nope, never visited the Bronze before I landed on BTVS.  Too busy getting those kids to strip for Undressed.  I used to read a lot of Marvel comics as a kid.  X-Men, Hulk, Iron Man, Spider Man, Man-Thing, Avengers, Howard the Duck (brilliant comic, baaaad movie).<BR>
<BR>
reyalS .V:  Aww, shucks.  You're too kind.<BR>
<BR>
amorphia:  Realease your anger... let go of your pants... (Said in my best Darth Vader voice.)<BR>
<BR>
memphis:  Free time?  What's that?<BR>
<BR>
bzengo:  Look, I'm blushing.  Thanks so much.  Ah yes, the female minion thing.  No real story behind that.  Our regular minion had to drop out. Amy our amazing casting director suggested a very cool female actress she knew.  We also thought it would add an interesting twist to the scene with Ben in Spiral.  "Flattering drawstring pants" took on a whole new meaning.<BR>
<BR>
hostile 17:  That's exactly what's going to happen.<BR>
<BR>
kronos: Put it to music and I think we might have a hit.<BR>
<BR>
Mia: Doing great!  Such is the freedom of the truly pantsless!<BR>
<BR>
Creep Crawley:  I salute your anti-spoiler dedication, sir!  And yes, there are HUGE secrets coming up that you really don't want to be spoiled.  I wish I could get my hands on whoever keeps leaking the good stuff.  I'd slap the serious hurtin' on 'em!<BR>
<BR>
Saint Buffy:  Snip snip!  I declare your wonderful site open!<BR>
<BR>
Evil Button Pusher: The Knights of Byzantium actually hail from southern New Jersey.  Lot's of places to hide in that barren wasteland.  Could be more of them, and chances are they're pretty ticked off.  Not about Glory slaughtering their brothers -- about living in Jersey.

<DD>tiggy3323:  Always a pleasure, my little monkey.  No, tons of emails not received.  Why?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
General questions answered:<BR>
<BR>
I don't think the Giles spin off (if it happens) will air in the US, unless they play it on PBS or BBC America.  Giles will be appearing in several eps next season before he dies -- uh, moves back to England.  Not sure how many.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Buffy is really dead.  Dead, I tells ya!  Dead!  But don't worry -- Zombie Buffy will keep slaying for two more seasons.  Grrrrrr!  Arggghhh!<BR>
<BR>
"Restless" may indicate more things to come.  Or it may just indicate the writers need apple juice and a nap.<BR>
<BR>
Spiral: Xander stealing Spike's lighter.  Beats me.  I think it was just to make the staging simpler.  Or it could be a clue to the next Big Bad... that's right!  Smokin' I'll kill you!<BR>
<BR>
Marc Blucas will return next season.  Unfortunately all that's left of him is a brain in jar.  Zombie Buffy tries to eat him.  Grrrrr!  Arggghhhh!<BR>
<BR>
The musical Buffy will all be written by master Joss.  He's a one-man band, baby!<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  Dru vamped Spike.  Looking forward to seeing more of you and your site.<BR>
<BR>
Joe the Owl: No, Tara was always the one that was going get brain sucked.  Not sure if any of the actors have signed on to voice the animated show.  Not sure when it'll really air.  Not sure if I'm awake or this is just a wonderful dream.  Nope, I'm awake.<BR>
<BR>
Amberlynne:  Yeah, I'm listed as writing supervisor on season three and four of Undressed.  Actually stopped working on the show back in October, but it keeps haunting me!<BR>
<BR>
DeAN:  Why of course I was this popular in high school.  Well, at least I was in my head.  And a fine noggin it is, too.<BR>
<BR>
Ergoshakes:  What's shaking, mama?

<DD>mephis:  Boxers today:  red with little white Dalmations.<BR>
<BR>
LittleHen:  Yes, Tiggy has done an amazing job with the site.  I visit often to see who's who.  For those of you who haven't sent her your photo -- what are you waiting for, an invitation?  Well, I'm inviting ya!<BR>
<BR>
Scourage of Europe:  Lavish praise always gets you points.

<DD>Mr. Monkey Butt has arrived.  Soooo happy that the Bronze is back up and running.  See what you guys have done to me?<BR>
<BR>
The usual disclaimer before we dive in.  Lots of questions, little of me.  Don't take it personally if I don't reply to your post.  <BR>
<BR>
Okay, everyone in the pool!
