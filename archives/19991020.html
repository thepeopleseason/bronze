Angle Man - Thank you for reminding me, I have ep 6 sitting on my dining room table ready to watch.  Which means I'm going soon...<BR>
<BR>
Kalika - Yes, the guitar bit at the end of "Lover's Walk" is mine and it's called "4m5".<BR>
<BR>
Well actually it doesn't have a title as of yet, although Little Willow likes to call it something like "The Loneliness of Five" which is not bad.  :)<BR>
<BR>
And for those who care about insider-TV-music stuff "4m5" refers to the fourth act and the fifth music cue in the act, respectively.

Hi Peace Fire, wolfguard<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Thumper, aglaea, Cladaggh<BR>

XG - Late october is traiditionally that time of year when air dates catch up with post-production schedules.  What that means is between now and when they start airing repeats (mid or late November?) we're finishing the shows only a few days before air.  But it's more fun this way.  Which is all a long way of sying no, I haven't swtarted ep 8 yet.  Just looked at 5 which I start tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow - Thanks, and where is that Lena?<BR>
<BR>
Jenk - nope, the theme is by Darling Violetta, among them Jymm Thomas, a Bronzer if I'm not mistaken.

Uhh, incase it wasn't clear there - I *do* indeed count Angel among the best shows on the air.<BR>

Moriah - I see I forgot to put in my post what my costume is.  I'm going as a<BR>
<BR>
DeM - Thanks.  You better go fast, "Guinevere" won't be around theaters for too long.  And don't you dare make fun of Dancin' Dan the macaroni - er, macarena monkey.<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander - Hi, see below<BR>
<BR>
gazoo - Without a doubt, Buffy.  It is my humble opinion that Buffy is the best TV composer gig there is  The Practice is a terrific show, but the tone of it just doesn't support the variety and density of the music in your average Buffy episode.  Some of the Practice cues are just a note or two or three - any more and it has a tendency to overwhelm the scene.  Buffy's tone is more grandiose and bigger-than-life and tends to have more room for music.<BR>
<BR>
I will say that I feel incredibly lucky to be working on two (and a half, if you count Angel) of the best TV shows on the air right now.<BR>

Lovely Poet - Here goes...<BR>

SOMETHING SPOILER-LIKE (BUT NOT REALLY) RE: NEXT WEEK'S EP. - "Fear, Itself."<BR>
*<BR>
*<BR>
*<BR>
*<BR>
*<BR>
Okay, for all of you having a hard time with the Buffy/Parker thing (what, you never heard of rebound relationships?) in the brilliant HARSH LIGHT OF DAY, here's fair warning:<BR>
<BR>
Buffy will be moping over Parker through much of the ep. and will still not be kicking his ass.<BR>
<BR>
This does not make her a whimp.  It makes her real.  You want fantasy?  Watch Dawson's Creek.<BR>
<BR>
We now return you to your regular postings.<BR>
