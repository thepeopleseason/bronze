<DD>Just de-cloaking one last time (what is this, HOURS later??!?) because, as I was proudly showing my first-time-at-the Bronze transcripts to friends, family, neighbors, childhood bullies and random strangers, I found two very important questions I found so juicy, I wanted to answer them right here, right now, without having  to wait till the next time I get a chance to post.  <BR>
<BR>
Impaler General: Thanks for the kind welcome!  I'm really, really proud of having worked on QAF, I'm still kind of awed that I got to be involved with something which is arguably a piece of television history, and I made some nice friends there, too.  To answer the second part, I adore Willow and Tara's relationship.  <BR>
<BR>
Sparrow: I've loved just about every episode of this show, but a favorite...well...Becoming, Part 2 is up there.  I bought the Sarah McLaughlin CD because of that episode.  Innocence, too.  And The Prom.  And the one with all the dreams at the end of the fourth season.  And Earshot.  And, well, Hush and The Body, of course.  Oh, and Blood Ties.  And the one with the invisible girl.  And pretty much anything with Faith...And Fool for Love.  Er...I like a lot of episodes.<BR>
<BR>
Now the rest of you guys had juicy questions, too, so hold on to them till the next time I get to drop in.  In the meantime, you all made my first time here so cool!  Thanks for all the warm wishes.  Can't wait to talk to you soon, keep an eye out for me!  <BR>
<BR>
I'm really gone now, really.  Poof and stuff.

<DD>OK, my sweet, sweet kittens, it is almost closing time here at Chez Z.  But I am having a blast talking to all of you...if I missed any of you, again, please forgive, it’s not intentional, I will try to get to everyone next time...couple final thoughts...<BR>
<BR>
Maryloye: Giles who?  Ha, ha, there I go again with the funny...seriously, I’m not sure if we have Mr. Head for my episode, we’re not quite there yet...we should know more soon...<BR>
<BR>
Slayerdaddy: I’m posting for the first time on a fan board and desperately trying to keep up with what appears to be approximately three hundred gazillion people.  Let Thoin read a book or something, I’m doing a fine job of distracting myself.  Seriously, has anyone seen my TV?  My CD player?  Hey, where’s my dog...?  <BR>
<BR>
Chalkdusty: Yes, we are planning to de-chip Anya.  No, wait, The Mayor.  No, wait...Quark...hang on, no...<BR>
<BR>
Sarah’s g: THERE ARE BUFFY CHOCOLATE BARS?  I mean, hmmm, how interesting, I’m rather fond of chocolate and Buffy, what an interesting combination...<BR>
<BR>
Paks: My group is already how big??!?  Does DeKnight know?  It would CRUSH him if my group suddenly became more popular than his....muahahahahahaha...oops, I mean, er...let’s not let that happen.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone: next time, I’m just bringing my sock drawer.  <BR>
<BR>
You guys are the best.  Save any questions I didn't get to, I promise to come back.  Take care, keep watching, we'll talk soon, cool??  Thanks for making my first time here so fun!!

<DD>DeMoriel: I love it!  InZane...ahhh, Mom must be SOOO proud right about now...nope, it’s not Zane...maybe it should be...that Billy guy seemed to do okay in that whole Titanic thing...well, I mean, he survived.  <BR>
<BR>
Kiba: Thank you...trying...to...type...faster...good to know Mr. Whedon has the same style...!<BR>
<BR>
Vampchica: Thanks!  And splendiferous is on my list of fave words, too.  Yes, I have a list.  Sure, they laughed at me in high school, but it seems to have worked out, that whole paying attention to words thing.  And that’s One to Grow On, kids.<BR>
<BR>
Cash: Sometimes you don’t even have to have Steve SAY anything to learn from him.  Just being in his PRESENCE is valuable and informative.  Just don’t tell him I said so.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson: Cool!  Thanks about the notepad.  And, yes, believe everything Fury says.  Especially when it’s nice things about me.<BR>
<BR>
Narrator and Mia and Vanessa: I think I meant “fourth” in a good way.  You know...YAY!  FOURTH!!<BR>
<BR>
Spike’s g and Shpadoinkle: Pick a favorite character?!??  That’s like picking a favorite child!!  It’s weird, you go from being a fan to being a writer, and suddenly you love them ALL.  Except I always did love them all.  So this actually makes no sense at all.  Move along, nothing more to see here...<BR>
<BR>
Adri: Currently wiping sweat off brow and actually saying “whew.”<BR>
<BR>
Danyle: Of course there will...!  :)

<DD>Slayerdaddy and Paks: A club?  For me?  Oh, my, I couldn’t possibly...yeah, wait, can we tell the kids down the street who used to pick on me in third grade? <BR>
<BR>
M: Season 6 is gonna ROCK!  <BR>
<BR>
Thoin: I want to answer all your questions, but right now I’m just worried because my socks seem to have disappeared...<BR>
<BR>
Sarah’s c: I have seen every single ep of Buffy...I was a fan WAY before I was a writer...well, before I was a working writer, anyway...I’m not real good on the ep titles, but that’s just ‘cause my brain is filled with important things like Brady Bunch trivia and knowing the difference between “Almost Home” and “The Torkelsons.”<BR>
<BR>
Bio: Hey, QAF does shoot in Toronto, but we writers were sequestered in California.  I have lived in CA since high school, but I’m not a native there, either, I was born in NY and then kind of moved around a lot.  My family settled just outside San Francisco, and now I live in LA.  But I hear Canada’s very nice.  Moose and such.  And maple things.  I [heart] Canada.<BR>
<BR>
Again, forgive me for being soooooo slow...Steve said you guys were a quick group, I didn't know he meant like this...!  I don't mean to ignore anyone...

<DD>tiggy: Thank you...since Mr. DeKnight said I was a nice guy, we should definitely be trusting what he says.  It's looking like I'll be doing Ep 9.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow: Thanks!  No, the writers have been very, very cool.  No hazing.  I mean, except for the whole having me wash their cars thing.  But everyone else went through that, too, right?  Guys?<BR>
<BR>
Red Crayon: Sure I'm flossing.  Every single month.<BR>
<BR>
Spike’s Girl:  Hints about the upcoming season...hmmm...let’s see...yes, there are going to be some vampires, I hear.  And some fighting.  Ha, ha, gosh, I crack me up...what I CAN say is that the new season is going to be AWESOME.  Some great stuff coming.<BR>
<BR>
Old One: I’ve been with Buffy for three whole weeks...and I LOVE it.  It’s an amazing place to work, and it’s an incredible group of smart, talented, really cool people.  It’s faboo.<BR>
<BR>
Vanessa: Nothing embarrassing happened to me in my childhood.  NOTHING.  And anyone who tries to tell you differently...well, unless they have the pictures, er, any pictures, don’t believe them.<BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Beasley: Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Some people make too big a deal about caramel, when everyone knows it’s, like, fourth in line behind chocolate, puffed rice and, um, other crunchy things...by the way, who played Jan in the Brady Bunch Variety Hour? <BR>

<DD>Ashley: Hey back at ya!  I'm fine, definitely excited to finally meet you all.<BR>
<BR>
DeAn;) : According to Steve, I am REQUIRED to remove an article of clothing.  I'm going with my socks for now, which may not SOUND exciting, but, you know...I have nice feet.<BR>
<BR>
Sparro: I'm writing for the live action Buffy.  Er, the dead action Buffy.  You know what I mean.<BR>
<BR>
Christopher M: Yes, indeed, I did write an ep of Queer as Folk.  It was the US version.  <BR>
<BR>
Cashmere: You mean there are Buffy fans who aren't rabid!!?  :)<BR>
<BR>
Forgive me for going slow, I promise I'll catch up to you guys...!  Still getting used to these infernal com-poo-tur things...
