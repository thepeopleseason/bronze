<dd>Yikes I dunno if that code is still <br>working...its been a while.<br><br>BIG BIG BIG NEWS!!!!!!!<br><br>ATTENTION AUSSIE VIEWERS!!!<br><br>BIG BIG BIG NEWS!!!!!!!<br><br>I just discovered today that <br>MIRACLES is AIRING IN <br>AUSTRALIA!!!<br><br>This is the new show David <br>Greenwalt produced and <br>show-ran, and I did the music. <br>This show is AWESOME: its the <br>best thing I'd seen on TV and I <br>felt totally privelaged to work on <br>it. <br><br>It is airing on Channel 7 in <br>Sydney and Brisbane, Monday <br>nights at 10:30 pm I believe <br>(check TV guide). I believe they <br>have already aired 2 episodes. <br>The third episode is quite scary, <br>goosebump moments abound. <br>everyone I know who saw it <br>literally got CHILLS several <br>times, which is typical <br>MIRACLES quality.<br><br>I also believe that in Australia <br>they will be airing the entire <br>season, which is better than <br>ABC did here in the States!<br><br>Its an AMAZING show and Buffy / <br>Angel fans should absolutely <br>love it.<br><br>Although it was cancelled here <br>in the USA, it was critcially <br>aclaimed, most critics saying it <br>was "better than the X FILES".<br><br>&copy;2003 yeah its a shameless <br>plug but that show deserves it <br>productions.<br><br>
