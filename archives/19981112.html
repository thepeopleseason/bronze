<DD> Sorry it takes so long between reading and replying, but my secretarial skills ain't what they used to be...<BR>
Fax1- the suit is still very uncomfortable, but I like being the one in it. It's better than the hair on my skin thing, but still required a very intense 18 hour, make up start to finish, high energy day.<BR>
Will-o - the glasses in Enemy are  yellow tinted - I thought tekkies who spent all day in front of moniters would need some eye gear. The big black ones are mine for fun<BR>
Roxanne- Jack Black who was in Airborne w/me is well featured in Enemy<BR>
Shtein -Hello Israel<BR>
Becker- cool<BR>
Pixie - thanks, don't fret, <BR>
you're very un boppish. RE parents- Either Judy Davis or Susan Sarandon, and either Kevin Spacey or Ed harris. But that's not very realistic.<BR>
Corperate Lurker- On the issue of heartbreak, and Willow, I can only say that I'm very pleased with the direction of my character, and the way in which he acts and reacts over the next 5 eps that we've filmed.<BR>
@llan- I have tried to answer the fan mail that I've gotten (and I was doing well for a bit) but (and I'm quite pleased by this)I've gotten a lot lately, and have not been able to respond. If you write care of the studio, I promise to get to it asap.<BR>
MatsuTerwilliger- the Wife, the ex, and the other ex's are fine, and the kids that I know about are well. Thanks for asking<BR>
Laurence- coke on the moniter? not Peruvian, I hope.<BR>
<BR>
Now, sorry to tease, but RD needs to get back to work, and I must get back to my actual job. Thanks for helping me pass the time, and for your niceties.

<DD>This may take a minute...<BR>
3SDFtN-Howdy, and welcome<BR>
VA BuffyFan, DrDan, SarhW, ParisAngel- thanks, yes that was me in Austin, &the 'Shh' scene was improvised, a testament to the genius of Mike Meyers<BR>
WinterRain - I'm in Enemy of the State for about 10 seconds, but the movie rocks the house- I recommend it to all<BR>
Sachiel -Dinner? Perhaps the cast of "my Dinner w/Andre' -at least I'd be guaranteed good conversation...<BR>
Devil -at this time, OZ has nothing but love for Willow<BR>
Will-o -would you be more excited to know that I've got David's boxers in my pocket?
