<dd>Ho ho ho.  Tonight I offer you my latest **1/2 episode (no -  wait!  I think Herc reluctantly upgraded me to ***!  Thanks, buddy!).  I feel compelled to reiterate my earlier warning: this one is not for the young folk.  Also, if all you're looking for is the funny, might I suggest a good Three Stooges rerun instead.  "Disorder In The Court" is my favorite. No no no!  Not the letter press, Moe!<br><br>I'll try to drop by after the ep tonight, but I'll have a house full of drunken miscreants, so I might not make it.  <br><br>Gotta go finish breaking ep.19.  Thanks for watching -- you guys are still the best.<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Thanks everyone for the <br>compliments!! Quite an intense <br>eppy to work on. What, with all <br>the music and all....<br><br>Allyson: check ya email!<br><br>lttle wiggins: some Aussie <br>friends had a couple of Tim <br>Tams left at their house here in <br>Pasadena. Needless to say, <br>they don't anymore.<br><br>superrrmk<br>PBP Aussie treats?? Can't wait!! <br>Hope you'll find me there in the <br>crowd. I'll be the one...looking for <br>Aussie treats.<br><br>whitewings:<br>if there were any, its purely <br>coincidence. All new themes <br>tonight. (minus the obvious Giselle <br>references!)<br><br>Again thanks all. It was a blast, <br>just like coming on here is a <br>blast. PBP, that should be a <br>blast too!!<br><br>

<dd>Darkguardian :<br>in answer to your invisible <br>questions...<br><br>1) No.<br>2) Yes I wrote the music score <br>for the episode. We did also use <br>occasional excerpts from <br>"Giselle", a balet by Adophe <br>Adam. But most of it was <br>original score.<br><br>Joss knows how to work us <br>HARD!! :)<br><br>
