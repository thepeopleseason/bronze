<DD><b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Hey!  How are you?  Thanks for the *bug* - it's just not a visist to the bronze without one!  hehehe<BR>
<b>X83</b>  The best way to get any of our CD's is via our official website, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>  We ship to the UK all the time, and our prices are quite reasonable, IMHO.<BR>
<b>Shade of Bronze:</b>  Well, hello!  Thanks for that!  *blush*<BR>
<b>Sci-Fi Bard</b>:  I want you to know that the kitty-in-the-window thingy you sent me is currently in my window.  =)

<DD>The only thing that sounded really harsh in the press was the end of the L.A.Times piece with my comment on the possibility of the WB putting Angel up against Buffy.  "That move is pure spite".  I actually said "It's pure spite, and they're not spiteful, so they wouldn't do it."  Small thing, but I only like to sound like Im attacking someone when I am.<BR>
<BR>
Animated Buffy.  It's first year at Sunnydale High.  Willow loves Xander, Xander loves Buffy, Giles works in the library, Angel's a good vampire who has a banterish and burgeoning romantic vibe with Buffy.  Cordy's a bitch.  It's all the stories that happened in between.  The great Jane Espenson (all bow before BAND CANDY) just turned in a script that I now must leave you to finish, 'cause if I say I overslept she'll say "You lie!  You were posting!" (Though I might get some slack 'cuz of that 'all bow' thing).

<DD>Okay, couple more things.  Yes.  I will make my on-screen debut in Angel 21.  No, I will not speak, and no, you will not see my face.  But I will make my presence known!  Just remember my watchword:  Dignity.  Always dignity.<BR>
<BR>
Also:  Next year, there WILL be a musical Buffy episode.  I'm working on it already.  And people, I'm warning you: it just might suck.  But I'll do my best.  I'm writing the songs and the script (And of course I'll shoot it).  The one thing I know for sure is I got some great singers in my cast.  It's gonna be the hardest thing we ever tried to pull off, and that INCLUDES the COMPLETELY UNSHOOTABLE episode 100 that nearly killed me.

<DD>Cream AND sugar.<BR>
<BR>
Also want to make clear, the WB as a whole always treated the show with enormous respect.  It was only the money guys (or guy) that failed to show that.  The network itself is made up of cool guys.

<DD>We don't know about Angel; we won't until the WB decides on their schedule.  I'd like to keep the shows together but Angel can stand on its own.  We'll see.  Meanwhile, the papers sure were fun yesterday!  Well, some of them were.  Of course some guys took me out of context and made me sound kinda harsher even than I am.  Plus a lot of false or skewed info from an unnamed WB 'source'.  This ewhole thing is weird.  I'm glad it's settling down.  I don't like fighting in the press;  it's ungentlemanly, and it takes away valuable procrastination time.  I meant to say work.

<DD>quick check in, with my morning tea, to see if you all have any questions.  Not that I'll answer 'em.  But I might.  Maybe.  If there's no math.
