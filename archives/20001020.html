<DD>uh... hi <b>grr agrr</b>!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Mr. Whyt</b>: it's all about the Joss, baby.  all about the Joss.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Narrator</b>: not my fault! not my fault!  if you'd just pay attention to the <i>show</i>, you'd KNOW the BBS is dead. i've been saying it for years now. the "Buffy" writers are just stating FACT.<BR>
<BR>
thanks, <b>LadyFaire</b>! i hope he keeps watching!<BR>
<BR>
<b>NuPhalanx</b>: no all-nekkid Darla eppies in the works, but we've been thinking about doing some all-nekkid Host-from-Caritas shows. (unfortunately, we're wrangling with Standards and Practices over demon genitalia -- i mean, if the appendage can't really be <i>identified</i> <small>not to mention taxonomically classified</small>, is it really pornographic?)<BR>
<BR>
must go.  outside.  where the sky lives.<BR>

<DD>hey gang...<BR>
<BR>
sorry for the bailage yesterday.  i got called into a story meeting before i could post responses to the following folk:<BR>
<BR>
hey <b>greengirl</b>!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob</b>: as much as i'd love to have Jenny return in some fashion, she is, unfortunately, <u>dead</u>. see, Angelus snapped her neck like so much kindling back in "Passion" -- remember that episode?  where he just twisted her head practically off her body? it made kind of a CRACK-hybrid-POP sound, if i recall, then she slumped to the floor like a big ol' sack of potatoes, never to rise again.  so anyway, that's why we can't have Jenny back.<BR>
<BR>
hello, <b>Chrissy</b>! glad to see you're free of the Taxman. and, hey, there's no shame in living with the 'rents for a while.  <small>unless, of course, you're Xander.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Circe</b>: so... i still didn't get your thing.  whatever thing it might have been. i suggest you call Western Union and threaten them with drawn-out disembowelment.  or, whatever -- forced "Evita"-listenage. something horrendous.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Crossbow</b>: (in re: directors) well, barring working with Joss again (which, unfortunately, is about as likely as me... oh... i don't know... showing generosity and kindness, for example), there are a couple directors who've worked on "Angel" and "Buffy" that i really like -- Tim Minear <small>(wait 'til you see ep 7 -- oh my GOD!)</small>, David Grossman, David Greenwalt (duh), Michael Gershman, and... oh, hell.  can i say Luc Besson, too? and the Warchowski brothers? and the Cohen brothers?  and Gina Prince-Bythewood?  and Sam Mendes?  how about Stanley Tong?  Zhang Yimou? John Woo? <small>i could go on, but i'll stop now, for the good of all Bronzerkind.</small> <BR>
<BR>
hey, <b>goldspike</b>!<BR>

<b>SPOILER-TYPE COMMENTS ON "UNTOUCHED"</b><BR>
<BR>
<small>first, to janni and JoAnne: i am grateful to you for your comments regarding my episode.  there are times when artists (a group in which i do not include myself, 'cause let's face it -- i ain't that good yet) lose sight of the original intent of art itself, namely, to strike chords in its appreciators.  to "touch" them, if you will.  a lot of what you see on TV or in the movies these days is empty -- void of what Bruce Lee referred to as "emotional content", or what Joss calls "emotional resonance".  basically, they don't make you *feel* anything.  they're the artistic equivalent of one of those old McDonald's styrofoam Filet-O'-Fish containers -- on the surface, they're utilitarian, pretty to look at, and easy to throw away, and in the long run, dangerous to the environment (think "artistic environment").  one of the reasons i love both "Buffy" and "Angel" is because i feel as though Joss's ONLY mission in creating these shows IS to "touch" the audience, to strike at their emotional cores.  and that's tough, especially in our jaded, overexposed, overexploited new-millenial era. in other words, Joss cares about *art*, at the fundamental level.  about connecting with people.  and your comments yesterday only served to make me more grateful for the wonderful opportunity i've been given here. if my (/Joss's) episode gave you reason to connect with some part of your inner life -- no matter how unpleasant the subject -- then the work is done.  it made you *feel*.  and to be party to that -- well, i think of myself as extremely blessed.  thank you so much for having the courage to speak out, to "end the cycle", as JoAnne said.  you guys are what make my job worthwhile.  thank you.<BR>
<BR>
KAMmie: re: your comments about why Bethany's father wasn't dead to begin with.  i think it's often the case that the person who was abused sees their abuser as a sort of omnipotent entity, all-powerful and -- the irony is intentional here -- "untouchable".  this is born partly out of fear ("This person can hurt me"), and partly out of guilt and shame ("If this person can do these awful things to me, it must be because they are more powerful than I -- otherwise, why would I take this kind of treatment?"). in the writer's room, we discussed the reason why Bethany has never, you know, squashed her father with a dumpster -- and that's what we came up with.  until you acknowledge that your abuser is a person, rather than some kind of all-powerful monster (a realization Bethany only came to in Angel's attic), fighting them seems an impossible task.  it was only after Bethany learned/acknowledged she had worth (from her time with Angel) that she felt empowered enough to take on the Beast.<BR>
