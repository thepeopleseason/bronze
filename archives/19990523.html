last post<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nicky - thanks<BR>
<BR>
OzLady - Jane's doing good, thanks.  I'll tell her you asked :)<BR>
<BR>
Anne - yes I did the "Close Your Eyes" bit.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - I've already got the other guy signed up... Robert Kral, young Australian composer who has been ghostwriting on several TV shows for the past few years, very talented guy, and can sound an awful lot like me when he wants to.  It's a great opportunity for him because it's not ghostwriting in the strictest sense - he'll get screen credit when he starts to take over and eventually I won't be involved at all.<BR>
<BR>
Angelalex - deciding where to put them all happens first, with Joss.  Coming up with the actual music (including recording and mixing) takes four to six days, although with G1&2 it kinda stretched to 7 or 8 per episode.  (There's 30 minutes of score in G2, a record)<BR>
<BR>
Paris_Angel - I have no idea what the direction will be on "Angel" for the scoring.  Although what you said sounds pretty likely.<BR>
<BR>
Gotta go, it's been fun as usual<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bye

second-to-last post<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hi Sami, Beldin<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - indeed it is hard to score two shows at once.  The plan is for me to start out doing Angel then gradually hand it off to another composer who will eventually take it over outright.<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer - mmm cookies... well if they're not ready when I go (which will be soon), keep a couple in the Bronze freezer for me<BR>
<BR>
Pixie - of course, didn't you hear the celstial voices singing "Pixie, Pixie, Pixie"?

Angle Man - sorry, gotta go with the Leafs here.  Especially since my Lakers seem to be headed for the toilet.  And use me all you want.  I like being used.<BR>
<BR>
PeaceFire - Thanks but I don't want you distracted and crashing the car OK?<BR>
<BR>
Malista - OK, gotta check Barrington out.  A score CD is a distinct possibility but not for some time; perhaps six months or so after the song CD comes out.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man again - according to this person on the ng that is indeed correct, but it went out on a different feed/time.  I could be wrong, I'm not hip to the whole sat thingie.

Mesuvius - thanks, cool name<BR>
<BR>
Strawberries - thanks, you mean the BMI award?  It's kinda silly... "here, you won an Emmy, so take this award as well".  But on the plus side I got to meet John Williams.  I probably came on a little strong... I believe my exact words were "I worship you".  I'm half expecting a restraining order to show up any day now...<BR>
<BR>
Paris_Angel - thanks, and here's where you can write:<BR>
Patricia Joseph<BR>
TVT Records, 23 4th Street, New York, NY 10003<BR>
Re: Buffy Soundtrack<BR>
<BR>
Angelalex - besides "Caracara", there are a couple of film projects I'm close to getting, but my wife would kill me if I mentioned them by name.  Very exciting stuff, one could be my first semi-big-budget studio picture.  Then of course there's "Angel" which starts in July for me.

Mallista - thanks.  Umm, Pheloung who?  (Feeling like I should know this... assuming he's a composer, if indeed it's a he)<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer - hi<BR>
<BR>
Sundance - thanks

Oki - can't confirm or deny the rumor re: not airing G2 - I'm as in the dark as you guys.  *However*, if I'm not mistaken, I read a post on the newsgroup that seemed to say the satellite feed went out today.  This by itself doesn't mean anything, the affiliates can still not show it, but it's encouraging.<BR>
<BR>
As for the topic-of-the-moment, I *can* confirm or deny the issue of Faith's redemption, which I won't do, except to say that the issue is handled in a very unexpected (and ultra-cool) way.

Anne - thanks & hi<BR>
<BR>
Sundance - "Caracara" is more or less about a woman (Natasha Henstridge, making her second appearance in a row in films I've scored, the last one being the recently-completed romantic comedy "Dog Park") who gets caught up in an assassination attempt on Nelson Mandela.  Luckily for me effective scoring does not require a thourough understanding of plot intricacies, 'cause this one is well, a little complicated.  But good.
