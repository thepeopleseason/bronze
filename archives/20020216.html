<dd>HI, Bronzers!  This is Nancy Holder at the PBP 2002.  I'm one of the Buffy BOOK authors.  This has been the best PBP yet!  What a great group!  Everyone is dressed so beautifully and the cast and crew have been incredibly available.  Everyone has been asking me where Chris Golden is and I'm saying, WHat?!  I'm chopped liver?!   Seriously, Jeff Mariotte and Maryelizabeth Hart and I have been having a great time.  We did a signing earlier today at Dangerous Visions Bookstore in Sherman Oaks, home of the Buffy author, Arthur Byron Cover.  Wish you all could have been here...how about the Las Vegas gig?<br><br>XO and stakes,<br>Nancy<br><br>

<dd>Responding to AussieBullDog, then leaving!  ;-)<br><br><b>AussieBullDog:</b>  It's pretty temperate around here.  Today it was sunny, and we had highs in the low 70's, I believe, and tomorrow's supposed to be partly cloudy with a high of 66.  =)  It hasn't rained in a couple of weeks at least...<br><br>OK, Goodnight again!<br><br>~E.<br><br>

<dd><b>4Paws:</b>  Hi there! Nice to "see" you, too!  Things are great here.  I haven't had to have a "day-job-from-hell" since early November, and I've been making a living purely on acting/singing since then.  (Yay!!)  As for your eye-color issue, at least green eyes are lovely!  I'm sure you'll look fabulous!  hehehe  Seriously though, I'm sorry you can't make it...I'm looking forward to it!<br><br><b>Reyna:</b>  Well, hello!  You are so sweet!  Thanks!  *blush*<br><br>

<dd><b>Lothar:</b>  Don't worry about it...  I get the blue color 'cause the nice people who run the board consider me a "VIP," since I'm the lead singer of a band that was on the show way back in the first season, and we're also on the BTVS Soundtrack Album.  =)  We're called Velvet Chain.  Our episode was "Never Kill A Boy on the First Dat."  Nice to meet you!<br><br>
