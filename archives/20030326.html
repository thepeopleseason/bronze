<dd>Okay, really gone now.  Thanks for everybody's feedback.  I'll pass some on to Goddard (while I'm beating him on the golf course.)<br><br>Bye.<br><br>

<dd>Okay, gang.  That's it for me.  Batphone's ringing.<br><br>satansbarrister - I was very aware of what I was writing in this current climate.  Didn't find it eerie as much as resonant.<br><br>Dear Mr. Fantasy, Carita - Rock me, baby.  Not big on the Blues.<br><br>Princess of Darkness - Gag Reels are every year.  We show 'em at our wrap parties.<br><br>kathypg, bdbdb - Thanks for the "Ben" feedback.  I agree with you.  But then I'm just a geeky fan like the rest of you.<br><br>

<dd>BlackMagickBitsy - Yep.  That was me pointing for people and saying: "Hey, isn't that the fabulous Drew Goddard!"<br><br>Cece - Sorry.  Can't spoil you.  Except to say there's a shocker ending!!!  (THat will no doubt be spoiled on some board by tomorrow.)<br><br>eirefaerie - I knew he was a Commie.  But a PIE HATER?!  God, the man disgusts me.<br>And yellow boots... That was I.<br><br>stansbarrier - I was able to make the switch because Joss doesn't have the pigeonhole mentality that most people in this business have.  Good writing is good writing.  <br>(And then there's my writing.)  And I wish Nick had more to do, too.  But then the show wou've been a two-parter.<br><br>SlayerQueen - Yes, after Buffy, I'll be moving over to Executive Produce and write FIREFLY on Fox with Tim and--  What?  It is?  (Crap.)<br><br>

<dd>Carita - Same old.  But hurry since we may be moving out of our offices in a few weeks.<br><br>kathypg, JaClaS - Yeah, I'm not buying into this "retcon" thing either.  It's called insight using back story.  Perfectly respectable.<br><br>And for Stevenav - I, too, would've loved to write a Xander ep.  Just wasn't in the cards.<br><br>

<dd>Sunburst - The rumors are true.  (Not about Goddard and Michelle.  ABout Giles and Ben.)  It was cut mainly because the first cut of the show was TWELVE MINUTES LONG!  But, also because some people didn't think anyone would be interested in Giles confessing to killing Ben.  Curious what you guys think.<br><br>And, by the way, some great stuff got cut out of the ep.  Funny, funny Goddard stuff.  Ah, if only there was a director's cut.<br><br>

<dd>JaClas - Oh my god.  You're right.  Of course it's a typo.  I meant to say Drew GREENBERG buried Spike.<br><br>eirefaerie - I wrote the verbs and punctuation.  Goddard handled the nouns and dangling participles.<br><br>

<dd>Stevenav - Sorry you're not liking the show.  These are the stories Joss wants to tell.  The characters develop accordingly.  If it's not to your wishes and desires, turn it off.<br><br>What do you feel was retcon'd about Spike?<br><br>And what the hell is retcon, anyway?<br><br>

<dd>I'm overwhelmed by all the kind words.  So, big blanket thank you to you all.<br><br>ALLYSON'S BIRTHDAY?!<br><br>Well, if she's out there...  Happy B-day, kiddo.  Enjoy the day.  Lemme know what you'd like.  (I'm asking for it, aren't I?)<br><br>bhd - No immediate plans except to sleep and have fun with my family.  If it's picked up, I expect to be returning for another year with ANGEL.  We shall see.<br><br>Kessie - Spin-offs are never dead.  Like Wood, they're just waiting for their moment.<br><br>Atomicsynth - My heartfelt condolensces.  And gratitude.<br><br>

<dd>JaClaS - We assumed he was buried secretly by Drew. his death no public knowledge.  Otherwise, couldn't really do neat scene with Mom catching him on the couch with a girl.  Story comes first.<br>As for the Mayor... We're all jonsing for it.  Wait and pray.<br><br>Soph - Be strong, Soph.  For Goddard's sake.<br><br>tiggy - We actually have a ten hole golf course set up in the Angel offices.  All playing to one of those electric practice putting greens.  Damn, it's a hoot.<br><br>Thanks, Carita.<br><br>Princess - "Steve DeKNight stole my pants."  And Joss, I'm afraid, doesn;t read unsolicited scripts.  (I can barely get him to read mine.)<br><br>Thanks you, too, muchly, Thatcrazytara.  Got one more episode on Angel.  No. 21, entitled "Peace Out."  Hope it turns out well.  Starts shooting today.  Meanwhile DeKnight wrote and directed a terrific 17 and Firefly's Ben Edlund's written ANgel 20, another kick-*** effort.<br><br>

<dd>HumVee - Nope.  Hairless again, like a newborn baby gorilla.  (Wait... They've got a lotta hair, don't they.  Think of something without a beard.  That's me.)<br><br>Thanks a lot, bhd.  Glad you liked.<br><br>

<dd>Carita - Hey, baby machine.  Congratulations.  I hope you're considering "Fury" as a middle name.  That is if you want something for the Toronto auction.  Not to feel pressured or anything. ;-)<br><br>Cosmic - Talk to DeKnight.  He shot the damn scene, sans tushy.<br><br>Princess of Darkness - It's true, I tell ya.<br><br>
