<DD>Well ... I guess I've bored people enough around here and I gotta grab a shower.  (Really.  I f you were here you'd want me to)  <BR>
Plus, there is that special on Lee Harvey Oswald tonight.  From what I hear (and this is just a rumor mind you) some folks think that he may not have acted alone!<BR>
<BR>
Yep.  That's what the man on the tv just said.  Will wonders never cease?<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, take care all LOSERS across the world.<BR>

G'night,<BR>

<DD>Little Willow - Check the August issue of SFX.  It has Aly   on the cover saying "I'm surprised no one has murdered anyone."  Then she calls us a "dysfunctional family."  Which is funny because that is exactly how I described it to Joss.<BR>
<BR>
They did blow up a part of a  quote from me out of context (in big letters) but all in all it is a pretty fair article on Buffy stuff.  Plus, he said I'd only been on DEEP SPACE NINE once and I've actuall been on all the Star Treks multiple times.  I was just listed as a guest star on that one and that's why it got in the data base they go by.  Other than that minor stuff they articles are both excellent.  <BR>
<BR>
Check it out when it comes your way.

<DD>Claris - I can't hang too much longer.  I did think about swinging by the Queen of England's place and nabbing some jewels for ya.  If you'd like that.  They're real shiny.<BR>
<BR>
Joy - I happened to see a tape of that Wizard thingy and heard Joss trying to figure out your "muskrat" communication.  Cute.  I hope your muskrat likes the fight scenes too.  My fave was the guy in helmet.  I kept hearing Bugs Bunny in my mind singing  "*Spear and magic helmet?"  <BR>
<BR>
* My favorite Bugs episode - btw

<DD>Pooks - No Girly Pop for me.  Since that episode I've gone into the whole proving my manishness thing by attempting to drink a gallon of rubbing alcohol a day.  You should try it.  If youwanna be a real man like me.  (*or possibly a blind man like me with no taste buds)<BR>
<BR>
Balf - I did exactly the same thing, unless Joss had something particular in mind that he wanted to see first (like that sword fight.)  Most night I'd get with Sophia an hour to a half hour before shooting and choreograph  it.  Then we'd shoot.  If you have great stunt people you can do it that way.<BR>
<BR>
This season they are keeping the same style for the most part, but the girls have to rehearse in advance with the stunt guys for a few days before each fight.  That's just how it goes.  But Sophia has been fighting on film nearly everyday for many years before BUFFY.  Both in the States and Hong Kong.  It gets easier with practice.  Most stunt people don't get to fight as often as she has.

<DD>Amerzi - Not sure.  I think it is just Playstation 2 (but I could be wrong)<BR>
<BR>
lotus - Can't say much yet.  Just that it is big budget, with big name star, set in the future, and we get a sword fight in it too.<BR>
<BR>
SexDwarf - Yep.  In Star Wars the actors heads were on the stunt guys bodies for the fight against Ray Park (Darth Maul)  When I was doing some CG stuff the other day the guys showed me something they were working on with James Brown.  A dancer was doing this big dance scene and they were shooting James singing and scanning his head so that they can put his face on the dancer and make it look like James is doing it all.  Amazing.  And scary too.<BR>
<BR>
One of my stunt guys who used to work on BUFFY with me is now VP of Production for a company and they just finished their first feature called PC & THE WEB.  I went to look at his new facility and he showed me some new technology that floored me.  No one outside of a few execs in Hollywood have seen it yet.  It's going to be a whole new world and  I wonder how long they will even need stunt people.  They can use the wire gags we did for the Playstation Game and put them in a film.  We'll never know.

<DD>Pook - I pick her up tomorrow.  Can't wait.:)<BR>
<BR>
bannana - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Okay ... here is a weird thing that just happened to me that will give you a chill:<BR>
<BR>
While I was on the phone to Sophia I got a call on the other line.  When I answered it it was a guy asking for Sophia.  I thought I recognized his voice.  Then he just hung up.  We couldn't figure out who it was.<BR>
<BR>
Then it hit me.  I pulled out an old tape of the guy that had stalked Sophia.  The voice sounded just like him.  Today I got a call from Karen Sheperd (Faith stunt double who was also stalked by the same man)  She told me that she just heard that this guy had been found dead in his apartment a few days ago.<BR>
<BR>
Then the hairs stood up on my neck ... <BR>
<BR>
I have no idea about this yet.  Karen just called me from the WALKER: TEXAS RANGER set to tell me what she'd heard.  Like a Tales of the Crypt episode, huh?

<DD>real pat - Nice to be able to drop in.  Especially during the time of the almighty losers.  A time that always holds a special Ty-ness to it for me.<BR>
<BR>
NBJ - Hey.  RD doesn't need beauty sleep.  He's already too pretty.  He needs to stay up for a week running to counteract his teen idol persona.<BR>
<BR>
ilerk - In the Playstation 2 Game for BUFFY/ANGEL I did a kip-up and during one point they used my kip and put it on Sophia's body.  When she saw the game she said, "Hey.  What's wrong with my kip-up?"  I told her she just improved.  hehe  I wish.  I'm not the world's greatest gymnast by a long shot myself.  I just throw myself blindly as if I were one of Jackie's poor stunt guys out for a buck. ;)

<DD>Olivia - Hi.  We're doing great.  Thanks for asking.  Sophia returns tomorrow from doing her co-starring role in a new movie.  I'm working with the Hong Kong guys on a new project right now and I leave in September to start a big budget feature in Europe.  So things are actually pretty darn nice.<BR>
<BR>
Thank God.

<DD>Hello.<BR>
<BR>
I've been too busy to even answer email for the past three weeks, but someone asked me to come on and answer a question (same one again) so I will.  He can read it here later.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you don't mind.<BR>
<BR>
The answer is this:  Yes, I did choreograph the fights and Sophia performed them - every one of them. (And every fall, burn, car hit and everything else physical that Buffy did.) <BR>
<BR>
As far as Sarah being a Martial artist goes:  I'll have to say the same thing that I have always said.  It doesn't have anything to do with acting, nor should it matter to anyone's enjoyment of the show.  It's just that if I answer any other way I would be just another Hollywood phony.  That I cannot do.  I have to stand up for the contributions of stunt people.  I'm one of the original people involved in getting the Emmy Awards to begin to look into creating a new stunt award.  We are still working on it.  My profession has a lot at stake in this kind of info being related openly and honestly.  <BR>
<BR>
Sarah has NEVER done a gymnastics move in her life.  She can't even kip-up.  She is NOT a Martial artist.  Not by a long shot.  I know.  I've been involved in Martial arts for over 28 years.  I've been doing fights on film for 18 of those years.  And I am the guy who made those "Buffy" fights you've been watching on TV.  For those reasons there is no person more qualified to answer this question than myself.  Please accept that.  Because it is the truth.  <BR>
<BR>
So far this 5th season there are two stunt doubles doing most of the physical work.  That's just how it is.  Sarah is a great actress, but not a Martial artist or gymnast.  That's all.  The stunt people deserve the credit for that part of the show.<BR>
<BR>
So that is the answer to that question.  Despite whatever new articles or phony bio info or PR you may find coming out.  <BR>
<BR>
If you want to see a real article on BUFFY, I suggest checking out next month's SFX magazine.  Lots of color pics with Sophia , me and  an Aly   interview with pics too.  A good one.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Hope that clears that up.  I'm working with the executive board that we've set up with the Academy towards promoting honesty in our biz so that our stunt people are not prevented from getting the rewards that they deserve for their work.  It's not easy to do.  And it doesn't always go down well with those who would rather keep you in the dark about what we do.  We have to be open about it.  We have to try.  Otherwise things will never change for those who come after us.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you guys will understand and will pass this answer around to any who bring up the question again.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks very much,<BR>
<BR>
