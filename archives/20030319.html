<dd>BlackMagickBitsy - I got my first job on Buffy (post p.a.) the old fashioned way - Nepotism.  Good like with the pie baking robot.<br><br>HumVee - I'm not sure what you mean about the dateline in ep. 7.  Would you mind clarifying a little?<br><br>trouble - Buffy is the only show I've ever worked on, but I always joke that it wouldn't be as great if I was working on Seventh Heaven.  Reading Buffy scripts really is a pleasure.  As a lot of you know, the writers and crew here are really cool so I think that accounts for a lot of it.<br><br>

<dd>Nikka and Sarcastic Kelly (luv yer name!)<br><br>You're actually both right in a way.  I'm supposed to check for continuity within the script.  For example if Buffy refers to a conversation that happened in a Season 3, I would check to make sure that the 1) the conversation did infact take place and 2) the the content of the reference is correct.<br><br>I also look for things like is a character appears in the beginning of a scene, but then is missing in a later continuation of the scene.<br><br>The script supervisor checks the continuity on set during the actual filming.  (i.e. which arm someone has a cast on, if the were eating or drinking, was the pony tail over the right or left shoulder.)<br><br>The writer's are very conscious of trying to maintain the continuity of the the entire Buffy story because they fully realize that it is important to the fans of the show.  But sometimes, things slip through the cracks.<br><br>

<dd>Kronos - Unfortunately I don't have much say in the actual storylines of the show.  I mostly proofread the scripts and keep an eye out for continuity errors.  The writers lock themselves in a room and talk out a story until it's ready to be written.  They never do a run through with the actors.<br><br>Kenickie - Do they still have an 11pm cut off for alcohol in England.  A friend there told me they were trying to change that.<br><br>Moriah - We'll definately be selling YANK cds for $5 a pop.  we may or may not have stickers ready by then.  If not, I'll send ya a couple on the house when they're ready.<br><br>To all my new friends - I hope that all of you who can make it to the show will introduce yourselves to me and maybe even have a beer.<br><br>I thank you all for all of your well wishes and support.  You're all darn good people!!!<br><br>
