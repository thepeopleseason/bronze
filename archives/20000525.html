<DD>OK, now I really have to go...<BR>
<BR>
<b>cian:</b>  Well, I don't actually work on the show.  I was on it once, with my band, Velvet Chain.  And we're on the soundtrack, CD.  The cast and crew has supported us over the years at our shows, and Seth played guitar on our "Buffy EP," so we've gotten associated with the show,  but that's it.  No official affiliation...except that the band loves the show and are total fans!  =)  Anyway, Hi!<BR>
<b>Motorcycle au pair Boy:</b>  LOL!<BR>
<b>DeAn:</b>  Just e-mail me when you order it, OK?<BR>
<b>Spacebabie:</b>  Mmmmmmmmmmm....yummy Dove bar!<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>

<DD>Hi, everybody -- Don't know the current color codes, but I need a favor...<BR>
<BR>
Trying to raise money for a local school (and this will cost you nothing): Lanai Road Elementary, Encino, CA, 91436<BR>
<BR>
Everybody go to www.schoolpop.com and register.  It's an online shopping service.  You never have to use it, but just registering earns Lanai and a school of your choice $5 each.  If you do, in fact, ever shop at the site, a rebate is also awarded.  Don't forget... the name of the school is Lanai Elementary.  Thanks, greatly, guys.<BR>
<BR>
Forgive the solicitation, but it's for a good cause.  <BR>
<BR>
And I'll never ask you for another thing again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until I think of something else.
