<dd>Lester “Creep” Crawley:  I’m going to have nightmares now.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  I want for nothing.  (Don’t tell Joss that.)<br><br>Yellowsub:  Wow!  A yellow sub!  I’ve been great.  We wrapped my ep last week, and there’s a good chance I’ll be doing one more this year.  Gosh, it must be Christmas.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  Bad, Princess, Bad!  Stay away from those evil spoilers.  No presents for you this year!  (Well, maybe one, if you promise to be extra good next year.)<br><br>Destiny:  Joss spills everything to us fellow writers.  Want to know how the entire series ends?  Nope  Uh uh.  Ain’t talking.<br><br>Singsinthecar:  Yeah, I suck.  Been extra busy between Buffy and Buffy Animated.  And next year I get to add Firefly to the mix.  Man, I really am the luckiest wooden boy in the kingdom.<br><br>Allyson:  Sounds like a triple X-mas for you, sweetie.<br><br>

<dd>Hollyn:  Yeah, we get about two weeks to recover from the party.  Sweet, sweet sleep here I come.<br><br>Molly:  If I drink enough, those boxers are gonna wind up on somebody’s head.  Hey Rebecca…<br><br>Joey Emma:  Yes, much talk with Joss about Firefly.  It’s going to be extra wicked cool.  And it sounds like the Buffy writers will be penning a few of the scripts next season.<br><br>AndeeH:  The BBC interview was filmed right outside of the Magic Box.  Do you have a web address for that?  I haven’t seen how goofy I look yet.<br><br>Algerina:  Want do I want in my stocking?  You, baby.  Cue the Barry White.  :o<br><br>Cushy:  I came back just for you.  Shhh. Don’t tell anyone.<br><br>Knickie:  Still on the fence about DK2.  Seemed a bit sloppy to me, especially compared to DKR.  And hey – didn’t I saw the big Bats/Supes fight the last time around?<br><br><br>For those of you who haven’t already partaken of the drug, three words:  XBOX, XBOX, XBOX.  ‘Nuff said.<br><br>
