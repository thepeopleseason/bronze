<DD>Okay, okay, I suck.  One more post because I see master Boo has popped in.<BR>
<BR>
Boo:  Thanks for the work on DeKnight's Riders.  You rock as usual.  And don't forget, kids -- get membership up to 300 and I'll send in an embarrassing topless pic of yours truly.  And Boo, you have my email address.  Just send me the writers workshop in
fo whenever you're ready.<BR>
<BR>
Last Gasp:  I just want everyone to know that nothing anyone says here affects how fast I post during my visits.  I usually have several things going on at once.  Nothing to do with any of you guys or any arguments you may be having.  But please, the Bron
ze is a special place.  Treat each other with love and respect.  This is best accomplished without pants, cause who can stay mad when they look so silly?<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Kiba Rilka:  So sorry!  Yes, please sign me up.  Do I get a hat?  I want to wear it the next time I go into Joss' office for notes.<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  I'd love to chat with the German fans.  I'm here every Friday, so just tell me when your site is up.  Nice pic, by the way.  Very slayerish.<BR>
<BR>
HumVee:  The animated show is just the thing to satisfy your ho-ho needs.  Pure, fun, high school Buffy.  Start watching Saturday mornings -- er, some time in the future.<BR>
<BR>
memphis:  I'm working on the animated show and trying to find a new place to live before the BTVS writers go back to work June 11.  My current commute is two and a half hours a day.  And you wonder why I don't wear pants?<BR>
<BR>
And that's it for me.  Thanks to you all for another lovely Friday. I'll be back next week.  Until then, play nice -- and send Tiggy your pics!<BR>

<DD>Had to step away for a moment.  Sorry if I missed some questions.<BR>
<BR>
Aves:  You know, the writers don't receive tons of fan mail.  When we have a UPN address, you guys should start writing.  Who doesn't love mail?<BR>
<BR>
Emz:  Buffy changed my life too.  Woo hoo!  Look!  No pants!<BR>
<BR>
Mia: Hope the mum is okay.  Count me in on Andy's birthday.  Anyone have that address again?<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  You sly fox, you!  You and Kristen ganging up on me?  ;)<BR>
<BR>
Darius:  I'd love to have Eliza back for some eps.  I'll get right on that.  Oh, wait -- I don't run the show.  Crap.<BR>
<BR>
SoulMan:  You just want laughs, watch a sitcom, my firend.  The Body was stunningly brilliant, and I'll Jackie Chan anyone that doesn't think so!<BR>
<BR>
janni:  Tiggy's heart?  What about mine?  Yowza!<BR>
<BR>
Kristen:  No happy meal for you -- you get the adult-sized portion. ;)  What's this about a writers workshop?  I'm all for it.  Do I have to wear pants?<BR>
<BR>
Okay, gotta go soon.  Last call, baby baby.

<DD>This is a special post to the one and only Tiggy:<BR>
<BR>
Tiggy, how much do you rock?!  Great, great site.  I'm honored and touched in all the right places (my heart -- get your mind out of the gutter).  It's great to see what all you wonderful Bronzers look like.  For all of you that haven't sent a pic in yet -- what's the delay!  Get on it!  Fill that site up.  Flying Butt Monkeys unite!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Tiggy.  You're the best.  Oh, and hey -- your pic?  Mama yama! :o

<DD>ntmt:  No vacation package for this boy.  I've spent the hiatus working on the animated show.<BR>
<BR>
hostile 17:  You are correct.  That is exactly what happens.<BR>
<BR>
Saint Buffy:  Did you mention something about underwear?<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  The Joss kiss up for Toy Story was purely unintentional.  Toy Story is my all time fav.  I was actually hired full time on Buffy before I relized Joss was the main writer.  All hail Joss! (okay, that was a suck up)<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow: No grudges, man.  No spoilers for next season either!<BR>
<BR>
WillowGabi (Kristy):  Nope, can't tell you anything!  Except it's gonna be sooooooo cool.  Can't really give out my email, cause of all the pants thieves.  But if you send the webmaster at DeKnight's Riders an email, he might forward it to me.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, way too many questions to answer individually, so here's some general responses:<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Buffy's dead and rottin' away in her grave.<BR>
<BR>
No, a new Slayer will only be called up when Faith dies. <BR>
<BR>
The WB is repeating Buffy this summer?  News to me.  They told us they weren't.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry again I can't answer all your questions.  I'm only a human without pants!<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to pop over to Tiggy's new site.  Be right back!

<DD>tiggy3323:  Yes, please!  Announce the location of the wonderful site you've built!  And thank you so much for the work.  All hail Tiggy!<BR>
<BR>
Narrator:  Yes, Joss had a big blow out at his place for the season finales of Buffy and Angel.  Much fun was had by all.  The shrimp was excellent!<BR>
<BR>
Doc:  Getting an agent can be one of the most frustrating things in the world.  I got my first one by placing in the finals of the Nichol Fellowship screenwriting contest. Other than that, you really need someone who's already at an agency to recommend you.<BR>
<BR>
Memphis:  Today's boxers are green with little snowmen.  They keep my butt cool in this warm valley heat.<BR>
<BR>
Miss Jess:  Welcome to the board.  As for my pants, I refuse to be a slave to confining fabrics!  Today, my pants -- tomorrow my entire wardrobe!<BR>
<BR>
Saint Buffy:  Rejoice!  We synched up.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  What workshop?  And hey, I don't put out for just a milkshake!  I want fries too!<BR>
<BR>
genrefan:  My first script will be episode 7.  Marti is writing part I of the opener, Fury part II.<BR>
<BR>
Major Wiggins:  Selectively, I choose to answer thus:  Buffy is much more dead than Spock ever was (unless you count that stint on In Search Of).  Olaf?  God?Hammer?  Hmmm... I'll have to go back and watch that.  I'll get back to you in a year or so.

<DD>Before I jump in, just a reminder that we of the VIP ilk live by a looser set of rules.  That means if you haven't seen The Gift yet, please beware.  You won't see any spoiler warnings in my posts.  That said, lets get to the good stuff:<BR>
<BR>
How about that finale?  Can Joss cook, or what?<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob:  I just saw Shrek.  Liked the animation, but thought the script was oddly weak.  Doesn't come close to Toy Story I or II.<BR>
<BR>
Joe the Owl:  Get ready for the big upset.  Last I heard, the WB isn't going to show repeats of Buffy or Angel this summer.  Nope, not a one.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, don't forget -- if you ask me a question, make sure you spell my name Steve DeKnight so it shows up in blue.  I scan kinda fast, and might miss it otherwise.  Also, as usual, I can't answer every single question.  Don't take it personally if I miss you.

<DD>Howdy, folks!  Kick your pants off and sit a spell.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  How's Saturday sound for that milkshake?  Cause you know, I am semi-respectable.

<DD>Hey Bronzers!  I'm throwing on a pair of pants and sneaking off to the movies.  I'll be back for some posting action around 2pm PST.  See you then.
