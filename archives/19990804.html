<DD>Real quick...<BR>

<b>Polgara:</b>  No...we're playing in AZ on the 13th, then we're getting back to work on the new album.<BR>
<b>Green Falcon:</b>  YES!  Do scream for an encore, OK?  (Here's a hint:  A really great song that I mentioned as one of my faves is the encore song, so you won't hear it if we don't get a big ol' response!)  Elizabeth is still in Australia, so she won't be able to make it.  We were both very annoyed by that.  lol<BR>
<b>Beldin:</b> Hi, thanks, and bye!

<DD><b>Green Falcon:</b>  Vacation was GREAT, thanks!  Yeah, well, "Diva" is a popular choice....but my taste runs more to "Treason" and "Come to Me..."  There will be both CD's and T-shirts for sale at the show!  =)<BR>

<b>Adina:</b>  Thanks!<BR>

We'll be playing at the Key Club in West Hollywood - our favorite place to play.  I love it there.  =)<BR>
<BR>
I don't think we made it into the "top ten" in the Lilith Fair votes, but thank you all so much for your efforts!<BR>
<BR>
Showbiz is pretty good...the new album should be out by November.  We're still debating about the title.  ;-)  We're going to AZ next weekend to play a gig there.  Should be fun. Some more songs have been licensed for use on a couple TV things...  Good stuff.
