I've gotta go now.  Tim said I order him around, but really it's the reverse and I have a big writey thing to do for him... (well, okay, really for Joss, but Tim was, you know, there).<BR>
<BR>
Anyway... always a blast everybody!  Be back soon!

One last clean up post:  I don't know what you mean, very nice person with very long posting name, about writing S&S as if I were from New York.  I was born in NY, if that helps?  Still don't know just what you mean. <BR>
<BR>
But I'm not sure it matters where one was born.  I've written many things I know nothing about.  Heck, practically anything I've written I know nothing about. <BR>
<BR>
Solas, I don't think Vampires can have children, but if you mean a child turned into a vampire, I love Claudia, but think A. Rice has covered that territory pretty well.

Hi again!  Not really gonna hang around tonight -- all the glory should go to Tracey and Tim tonight.  <BR>
<BR>
But... Kim!  asked a good question about assigning writer's credit.  We all work on the story together (= Joss comes up with it).  But the person who gets the credit is the person who converts a blackboard full of scribbles into fifty pages of action and dialogue.  On a sitcom,  it is much more thoroughly collaborative and the name of the writer is often very arbitrary.  But not at Buffy/Angel.<BR>

Angus -- Joss told them... er, I mean... who can fathom the black heart of a nazi?  Also, they wanted a thingy that wouldn't harm pure race demons and only wipe out human blood folks.  Kind of like zapping the people and leaving the building standing kind of deal.

<DD>Faithsbro, Joss has everything to do with everything.  He doesn't tell us exactly how many lines of dialogue to write, but Joss and all the writers discuss who is in each scene, what those scenes are about, and how they're structured before a writer goes away to write the draft.  It's all done with him or by him.<BR>

<DD>Questions... How did I adapt to writing for Buffy?  Well, when any writer joins a show, they do everything they can to learn about all the existing eps and fall in love with the characters and stories.  I tried.  I fell in love (heck, I was in love already).  I'm still learning.<BR>

Is Buffy a difficult family to grow up in?  Well...yeah, my "Dad" is a genius...

Hi Tracey Forbes, we've never met.  I was born in Montreal but have lived in Calgary and Toronto as well... heard a rumour (note spelling) you're Canadian.<BR>
<BR>
Charity - thanks, if you mean "Angel", I'll pass on the kind words to Rob.<BR>
<BR>
AjO - I gave permission but really... that's meaningless since I don't own the music. They asked if it was OK with me and said "sure".  I always made it clear that Fox owns the music, although I feel a site like the CBCC is pretty darn harmless.  but that's just my opinion.<BR>
<BR>
Jennie - perhaps you might try rephrasing your question.  My tiny brain had trouble parsing that.<BR>
<BR>
Malista - no, actually, I forgot to look for it, but now that you've reminded me, I'm going over to amazon right now.<BR>
<BR>
night Owl - wow, that sounds cool.  Thanks.  I mean no harm to anyone really.  And hi to Circe should she be scroloing tomorrow AM.  Oh and Circe if you do ever get your hands on the FSM review (you know which one) e me, I'll e you my fax number, and maybe you could fax it to me.

Theater Girl / Madrigal - long time no see.  uhh, I tried calling you, but your secretary said you were booked solid for weeks...  you buyin that?<BR>
<BR>
Oh, speaking of, to answer someone else's question for Rob earlier, the woman singing the vocals on tonight's "Angel" was Elin Carlson.<BR>
<BR>
Solas - Easy question.  Favorite TV composer - Mark Snow.  (Oh and Rob Kral too!)  Film composers - Thomas Newman, Eliot Goldenthal, Danny Elfman, David Hirschfelder (your fellow countryman).<BR>
<BR>
kim! - That sounds intersting, is it any good?<BR>
<BR>
VT - well, if I had a show to work on I'd be working (hear that Joss?).  And what, *that* is my allotment for ass kissing?  I guess we'll have to move on to other body parts then.<BR>
<BR>
slay_me - I wonder that myself.  And to repeat myself from before this season started, you don't even know the half of it.<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen, Simply I - thank you.

Lots of questions for Rob, looks like y'all scared him off.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming everybody loves everybody, Rob will be more or less taking over the show on his own at some point in the future.  It's been a gradual process throughout the season, but with the exception of a few music cues in IWRY (you know which ones) Rob has handled the Angel scoring pretty much on his own for three or four episodes now.  I'm still gonna hover around a little while longer so's my clients don't feel too abandoned, but unless things go terribly wrong, Rob should be taking fully over early in the new year.<BR>
<BR>
I'll coax him back here soon, not to worry.

About Willow and her pain... the idea behind this ep was when a perfectly nice person is in a lot of pain, eventually they take it out on the people around them.  Of course, i have merely OBSERVED this phenomenon, I have never accutally DONE it.  It's not that the gang is insensitive, but when you're in pain you forget everyone else has problems too.  And then you become a vengeance demon like me -- I mean, like that fellow I observed.  Uh, I gotta go.

Kiwi -- the Beacon destroyed anything with human blood.  Prue humans or any permuation of human.  This is why the First Mate went bye-bye.

<DD>On the Buffy tip, seing the comments about the Buffy Riley thing.  Some people think they're just too cute and fluffy.  Well, maybe I think it would be nice for Buffy to have an easy, stable relationship for once that doesn't cause her any grief, doesn't become dark and confusing so she can have some peace!<BR>

Or maybe I'm Joss...

<DD>Two quick things:<BR>
<BR>
- I know we're all talking about ep. 9 of both shows... but I just had a look at Buffy 10, which is quite possibly the most inventive hour of television I have ever seen.  I wish I had more time for the score.  In fact item one on tmorrow's agenda is to ask, no, beg for more time.  It's an entire opera's worth of music.  A month wouldn't be enough time.<BR>
<BR>
- 100% of tonight's music (including that beautiful "hero" theme) in "Angel" was composed by Robert J. Kral.  I gave him a few suggestions here and there but he's the guy.  And he turned in an amazing score.  So please direct kudos to him tonight.

<DD>Well.  Some responses from our eastern contingent.  A lot of people want to kill me  (a little disturbing), one person wants to eat me with a spoon (less hostile, still a little distturbing) and one wants to lick me to death (very disturbing, but oddly  compelling...).  Yes Doyle is dead.  We killed him.  Sorry about that.  And yes, next week Wesley will be doing a stint on the show, obviously a very different vibe than Doyle.  Hope you like, cuz Alexis makes me laugh an insane amount.  We've got even more plans to shake the show up, just wait.

<DD>Well, it was easy to become a Canadian writer.  First, I was born in Canada.  Second, I wrote stuff.  :-)  But, to be a Canadian and work on an American show meant having an agent in LA and a whole process of flying down for meetings a few times, then with the immigration...blah.  It was a big ol' deal.

The gig on the 12th was GREAT, and then we did a last-minute gig at the House of Blues on the 22nd, which was a lot of fun, and our next show (also the LAST of the year - I won't say "milennium," because as I'm sure you know, the millenium ends on Dec 31, 2000...NEXT year) is on Dec 8th, the day after my birthday!  =)<BR>
<b>Absinthe:</b>  Hello!  Well, that's ok...you eat well on Christmas, don't you?  ;-)<BR>

<b>Kendra:</b>  I abolutely loved the crossover.  Thought it was brilliant.  Perfect combo of a funny "Buffy" and an emotional rollercoaster "Angel."  woo-hoo!
