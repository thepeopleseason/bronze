Creepy: No comment.  <BR>

<DD>Just passing through with one of my cranky rants...<BR>
<BR>
Glad most of you enjoyed the shows last night.  <BR>
<BR>
To the few of you who don't see this season's been as strong as any year of Buffy: "The Body," "Fool For Love," "Blood Ties," "Family," etc., all I can say is... Go watch some reality programming.  This stuff's wasted on you.  <BR>
<BR>
And anyone who doesn't know that Marti Noxon is one of the prime reasons for the greatness of this show, is a complete and utter moron.  (Hear me, Doctor?!)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, back to my bright and cheery disposition...<BR>
<BR>
Morning, everybody!
