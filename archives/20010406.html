<DD>Okay, a couple more answers and then Stevie's gotta go shake his money maker.<BR>
<BR>
Summer Vacation:  We writin' folk only have about a month off before we have to get with the assembling for next season.  I've got some top secret side projects cooking that I'll be stirring up -- I'll give you more info once things start to boil.<BR>
<BR>
Lizzy Slayer: Cry "Havok!" and let slip the dogs of war!  Or, if I may:<BR>
<BR>
...I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<BR>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech<BR>
To stir men's blood.  I only speak right on.  (Just like Superfly!)<BR>
<BR>
Mia:  I haven't talked to them in a while, but I believe I will be dropping by the Succubus Club on May 9, the night after ep. 20 airs.  I'll keep you all posted.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, yeah, what's happened to Boo?  Boo...  Boo... where are you...  You will sleep now, and when you awake, you'll post those pictures I sent you!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Feel my power!  I said feel it!<BR>
<BR>
Okay, that's it for me.  I've got a big thing happening next Friday, so I might not make it in.  If not, I'll try to catch up with you guys on Saturday.  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>Sarah's Carl:  At the end of the season when the scripts are all done, the writers curl up in a big warm bed, pull on their sleeping caps, and take a well-deserved month-long nap.  Now if I can only get Fury to stop snoring...<BR>
<BR>
Steve's Past Jobs:  Ouhhh!  Scary, kids!  Video store clerk, security guard (no gun -- just a lousy flashlight), and English Teacher at a Japanese school.  No, not in Japan -- they wouldn't let me in the country because of that, uh, you know, pants thing.<BR>
<BR>
BCangel:  All TV/Movie scripts are written in the third person.  My mind frame is usually that of a 15 year old skinny boy -- a lot of thoughts about space ships, monsters, and girls -- especially girls in space ships being chased by monsters.  Each Buffy is plotted out in detail and approved by Joss before we start writing.  Generally, we write a single-spaced 13-15 page outline for a 52 page script.

<DD>Time running out!  Must type faster (me, not you).<BR>
<BR>
Shameless plug:  Check out this month's BTVS fan mag.  Interviews with me and the amazing Rebecca Kirshner.<BR>
<BR>
Show hiatus is starting soon.  Ep. 22 wraps end of next week, then most people disappear.<BR>
<BR>
Vampyr Zaria:  Thanks for the compliment.  Here's a little something on ep. 20... May 8.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  What'd you think, I'd let it slip that Xander's head explod -- oh!  Tricked me again!<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323: A man is only as good as his word (don't quote me on that).<BR>
<BR>
Wrap Party:  Pants were sadly the rule of the day.  Yes, the cake was chocolate, and quite delish.  Jane and Rebecca ate most of mine, claiming it tasted the best off my plate (never a trurer word has been spoken).<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I'll be at the 2002 PBP.  No, no more rum and coke.<BR>
<BR>
Joey Emma: Thanks!  Burger extra tasty!<BR>
<BR>
If I had to choose a board name:  No contest.  SUPERFLY.

<DD>Yikes!  That'll teach me.  Okay, so, in no particular order...<BR>
<BR>
If I could write a character based ep, which character would I choose?  Couldn't answer that one if I tried.  Not trying to suck up here, but I love writing for every single one of them.  I hope I get to do episodes centering on each one.<BR>
<BR>
Steve's Writin' Work Schedule: Get up, eat, write, eat some more, curse my spastic brain, write, go to bed.  Dream of eating.  Seriously, we gather in the office pretty much Mon - Fri. for eight or nine hours a day.  We break stories, laugh until we puke, then head home.  If we're actually writing a script, most of us work at home for about a week until it's done.  Then we come back to the office for more laughs (and puke).<BR>
<BR>
Here's a little something on the Season Finale:  May 22.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  What'd you expect, I'd actually tell you about Xander's head explod -- oh!  You tricked me!<BR>
<BR>
Wanda eonline.com is printing spoilers?  Bad Wanda, bad!  But now that everybody knows that, DON'T READ 'EM!  Trust me, you'll enjoy the show better if you don't know what's coming.<BR>
<BR>
As a writer, do I have any input?  Sure!  Why, just last week it was my suggestion that we get extra cheese on that pizza.  Seriously again, one of the great things about Joss and Marti is that they not only encourage our input -- they expect it.  When we're working on a story, all the writers get together to "break" it.  Everybody gets the chance to toss out stuff.  Great writers' room.  Fun and enormously supportive.<BR>
<BR>
Before Buffy:  MTV's Undressed.<BR>
<BR>
Vampire demon human -- beats me.  The vampires are the one's with the fangs, right?

<DD>Mmm... Turkey burger.  Stomach full of warm goodness.  I'll be around for the next hour to tend to your Buffy needs.  Questions, anyone, questions?  You there in the back!  Wake up!

<DD>Uhp!  Sorry!  I'm about to run off for lunch.  My apologies to all the questions I haven't had a chance to answer.  I'll try to stop back later, say around 4 or 5 PST.<BR>
<BR>
Before I poof, let me see if I can answer a few more.<BR>
<BR>
Creep Crawley:  Yes, I saw the Universal cut of Brazil years ago.  Very strange.  Yet more proof that executives should stick to counting those beans and leave the creative stuff up to people that are actually creative. As for dear Hugo Weaving, yes, I first him in Proof when it came out.  Amazing actor.<BR>
<BR>
elreyn24:  So polite!  Of course you can ask questions.  Might want to save them for when I return, though.<BR>
<BR>
Vampire in the basement:  I hear USC is a great school.  I'm a UCLA man myself, so I don't have the inside scoop.  If you're intersted in film, either one of these would be a good choice.<BR>
<BR>
And with that, I must slouch off to gnaw on the bones of my enemies.  Or at the very least, a turkey burger.<BR>
<BR>
Poof, I say!  Poof!

<DD>Too... many... questions.  Musn't... black... out...<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so as usual don't be offended if I don't shoot you a personal response.  Just trying to save a little time and get these out as fast as possible.<BR>
<BR>
smash: I don't drink coffee, but there are plenty of things you can fetch me.  If you promise not to call me McKnight.<BR>
<BR>
X83:  Thanks.  My hat's off to Joss, who gave me a great story to work with.<BR>
<BR>
Leather Jacket:  Blood Ties is re-airing?  Sweet!  I smell residuals!<BR>
<BR>
Molly: Joss knows all, sees all, and does a mean happy dance.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323:  Aw, shucks.  I feel all warm and gooshy inside.  Uhh... maybe I shouldn't have had the seafood pasta last night.<BR>
<BR>
elreyn24:  Is Buffy a go for four more years?  I don't know, but I hope so.  I'd hate to have to go back to Undressed (the show, not my current state of being).

<DD>Amberlynne:  Your rommate watches Undressed every night?  Quick!  Rush her to the emergency room!  There must be something seriously wrong with her!  All kidding aside, there were some amazing writers on that show that wrote some wonderful scripts -- that got completely mangled by the time they were shot.  Welcome to Hollywood, eh?<BR>
<BR>
Kane:  UK party?  I'm definitely considering it.  Burp!<BR>
<BR>
clarrie: Snerk away.  Just hope you don't go blind.
