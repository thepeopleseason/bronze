<DD><b>Odin:</b>  Thanks for the info.  OK, so depending on how well or porrly Willow did on math, I'm about at Willow's level...not bad company to be in, I must say.  But still, I repeat, test scores are somewhat arbitrary, IMHO.<BR>
<BR>
OK, enough on that subject.  Just wanted to stop by and thank all the cool people who e-mailed me offering to send me a copy of last night's Spike ep!  You all rock.<BR>
<BR>
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!<BR>

<DD>Hi and Byr to <b>fax1,</b> who now has implanted that Neil Daimond song in my head!!!  ;-)  (Actually, I don't like Neil diamond as a rule, but that song's pretty good...right up there with "Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon.")

<DD><b>Vamphire:</b>  Hello, and congratualtions on a not-bad-by-a-long-shot first post! =)<BR>

Um...I scored lower than Buffy, but I forget what Willow got.  Someone help me out here?

<DD>  Really quick...<BR>
<BR>
Iwas scrolling, and I caught just a little of the SAT discussion.  First of all, I think it is a good point, and a very interesting idea, that Buffy's scores could have been tampered with.  On the other handm I would like to state that test scored are not always indicative of one's intelligence.  I knew of a few people in high school who were rather "thick," and yet did well on the SAT's.  I, on the other hand, did very well, but not nearly as well as my IQ score might suggest I would do.  So, I'm just saying, you never know.  (MHO)</SMALL>

<DD><b>DestructoGirl:</b>  Yes, that is indeed lovely news.  =)  Thanks for telling me.  (Now, you said your carpool buddies like it...does that mean you don't?  heheh)<BR>
<b>TruKnight:</b>  Yeah, I'm sort of hoping someone taped it and will lend me their copy.<BR>
<b>SLaYeR:</b>  I'm sure I could beg one from someone in the production office, but what a monumental PAIN!!  I'd rather just wait than go through the trouble...(gotta save those favors for something <i>really</i> important, you know?)<BR>
<b>DeMoriel:</b>  Hey, there!  Did you receive your CD yet?  (I sent it out a couple of days ago...but you know how the mail is around the holidays...)<BR>
<b>Blackheart:</b>  Maybe Little Willow, my lovely co-bodyguard, taped it...?
