Hi, poster people --<BR>
<BR>
Do me a favor and tell David Mello and anyone else that posts this nonsense that I was "complaining" or "whining" about the WB or feeling that the show is "blunted" by network interference.  <BR>
<BR>
I was simply answering the question about scripts that never got made, telling an anecdote about the history of "Corrupt."  <BR>
<BR>
Tell whomever cares that the WB has never interfered with either show, they simply have a vested interest in the success of both.  They're entitled to input.  It does NOT, however, compromise Joss' vision on either show.  He doesn't make a change unless he and David G. want it.  Okay?<BR>
<BR>
And a big SO to all the Toronto bronzers for meeting up with me last Monday.  Had a blast.<BR>
<BR>
Later.
