<DD>Melody, the first <BR>
time I heard about this famous <BR>
arguement between me and Sarah <BR>
was from a british journalist <BR>
during an interview.  And now <BR>
you.  Rumors are neat.  This one <BR>
is entirely false.  The only time <BR>
I left the set for any length of <BR>
time was for my appendecitis, and <BR>
that was just a few days, and <BR>
Sarah didn't cause that.<BR>
<BR>
And if I had to stop being in the <BR>
entertainment industry I would <BR>
teach.  I adore teaching.  Or be <BR>
a colombian drug lord, 'casue <BR>
CHICKS DIG DRUG LORDS.<BR>

<DD><yellow64>Yes, I did see that <BR>
Marc had been here and was <BR>
(graciously) reeling from the <BR>
nasty things people had said.  <BR>
Twice in a row!  congratulations!  <BR>
No actor will EVER DARE SET FOOT <BR>
HERE AGAIN!  Weeee!!!!.....<BR>
<BR>
Actually, i understand if people <BR>
don't particularly support B/R or <BR>
B/A, that story stuff and <BR>
everyone's entitled to their <BR>
preference.  But some stuff is <BR>
too personal (Hey, I'm still <BR>
cranky that someone posted I <BR>
couldn't dance).  I just love the <BR>
fact that people posted that <BR>
Amber is too fat and Marc is too <BR>
Skinny.  Having been around both <BR>
of them (one of them <BR>
shirtless...) (no, you idiot, <BR>
Marc!  What kind of a show do you <BR>
think I'm running?), I laff till <BR>
it hurts and I have to stop.  <BR>
It's pretty much like saying i'm <BR>
too asian.<BR>

<DD>Oh, everyone's death <BR>
is caused by influenza.  We <BR>
thought about having a cool big <BR>
fight with stuff turning into <BR>
doves, but influenza just seemed <BR>
more topical.  I don't know if <BR>
you guys know this, Buffy has a <BR>
young, hip kind of audience.  <BR>
young, hip, and <BR>
influenza-obseesed.  Hey we pay <BR>
attention to stuff like that.<BR>
<BR>
As far as season five goes (on <BR>
both shows) we have a lot of <BR>
great arc stuff happeneing (like <BR>
influenza vaccinations and stuff) <BR>
but we're mostly just staring at <BR>
each other going "why aren't we <BR>
on vacation yet?"  need to <BR>
recharge.  Very tired.<BR>

<DD>Hey all.  Quick 'hey <BR>
all' from me (see above) (not <BR>
actually that far above).  Just <BR>
got off the phone with the <BR>
AMBERish one, told her about the <BR>
extremes of support you wacky <BR>
kids showed for her.  Touched she <BR>
was.  The following characters <BR>
are DEFINITELY GOING TO DIE:<BR>
1)Graham<BR>
2)Buffy<BR>
3)Little Nell<BR>
4)Adam<BR>
5)Graham (twice)<BR>
6)Riley, but not the one on Buffy<BR>
7)Tara, but not Amber, who will <BR>
go on to play Ponzo the <BR>
Wonder-Flea to great acclaim.<BR>
8)Me (optional)<BR>
<BR>
