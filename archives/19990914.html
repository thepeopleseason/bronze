chi - I'll take what compliments I can get  - thanks<BR>
<BR>
menkhare - you forgot your spoiler warnings<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - Ha!  Danny lux is one of my better composer friends actually.  We spent a year working the same year for Mike Post five years ago.  I've actually never heard a Profiler score but I think he's very talented so I've no doubt they're great.... and again I'll take my compliments when I can get em<BR>
<BR>
Lena - heya.  He kicked his ball for the firts time three days ago.<BR>
<BR>

Narrator - I agree it was rather ironic.  They didn't show the best part though :)<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - That quote is not necessarily accurate... things are actually quite up in the air on the theme.  We'll see what happens...<BR>
<BR>
Luna - I do enjoy working crazy hours but necessarily so many of them in a row.<BR>
<BR>
horizon - thanks (you don't know the half of my swampage)<BR>
<BR>
Claddagh - hi, thanks<BR>
<BR>
hi thy Slayer

carl - right away sir<BR>
<BR>
surleigh - for films if I had to pick a top three it's John Williams (of course), Thomas Newman, and Danny Elfman.  For TV the pickin's are a little slimmer but I'm a huge Mark Snow Fan, and I like Snuffy Walden's stuff too, and the guy whose name I don't remember who does (did) Homicide.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - I honestly don't recall.  That sounds like something I'd remember.  Send them again?<BR>
<BR>
Kristen - The site's been down for months as far as I know.

Vaedus - Well, actually my college roomate had a full head of grey hair at 21.  Sorry man.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Hi NuPhalanx<BR>
<BR>
Carl - no no no, that's what gives Capn Crunch its edgy quality - that twinge of pain as you chew.<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer - I thought you'd never ask<BR>
<BR>

Lovely Poet - fine and hi yourself<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - I did watch the emmy's.  Generally yawningly.  I had no idea they were going to show a Buffy clip, though.  How cool was that?<BR>
<BR>
surleigh - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Luna - been busy working on a bunch of shows pulling some crazy hours but otherwise - wait there is no otherwise.

Angle Man - remind me.  I'm very forgetful.<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen - I'm perpetually swamped, at least for the next eight months.  But it's not fun any other way.<BR>
<BR>
Vaedus - The Snow Music from Amends is not available anywhere right now.  If the CBCC ever finds a new home it'll be the first to have it.
