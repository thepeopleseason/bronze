<DD>hehehehe...the funny stories are awesome, guys.  (4Paws, Thoin, Sita...)  You all completely ROCK.<BR>
<BR>
I'm gonna jet, now.  I am indeed feeling a bit woozy from the adrenaline.  I am not a happy camper.  Thanks again for the sympathy!  I really appreciate it.  Bye!<BR>

<DD><b>X-Lander:</b>  I'm hopeful that the damage is limited to the body.  (But the frame is completely bent out of shape, which is bad enough.)  The car rode fine on the way home, and the engine seems OK.  Thank Joss.  (Oh, and funny you should mention it:  I am eating chocolate right now.  Haven't even had dinner.  I needed it.)<BR>
<b>Keira:</b>  Thank you!<BR>
<b>4Paws:</b>  Yes, I am very glad I didn't get hurt.  But d@mn, I'm furious at myself!!!<BR>

<DD><b>SarahNicole:</b>  No, I wasn't hurt, thank you for asking.  But I felt sick to my stomach because I can't believe I was so STUPID!!!!  And I can't even begin to impress upon you how bad the timing is, monetarily speaking.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>Lady Wolfsbane:</b>  ICK!  NO!  That's horrible. I'm sorry.  =( <BR>
<b>FASTEDDIE:</b>  I know, but it's evil anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Here's the funny (haha) part:  The bumper is still hanging on over by the passenger side, and it's completely messed up, so it's dragging on the ground, etc.  Well, I had to duct-tape the holy hell out of it to keep it on and prevent it from dragging, just so I can get to work tomorrow.  hehehe...it looks absolutely RIDICULOUS.  The whole thing is held together with duct tape.  Lordy.

<DD>OK, thanks! Here's the deal:  As a lot of you kow, I have a day-job, since unfortunately the band doesn't make enough income to live on.  I work at Bloomingdale's department store, and today I had a particularly stressful shift (huge sale going on - yuck), so by the time I got off work, I was brain-dead.  Wellllllllllll...I got into my car, proceeded to back out of my parking space.....and tore into a stantion that I did'nt see, completely ripping off my entire front end!  I tore off the bumper, and the entire front quarter-panel as well.  We're talking at least $2,000 of damage...and I have no money to begin with!!!!!!  That's why I HAVE a job!  IT's gonna take me about a month and a half to make enough money just to PAY for the damage!!!!  WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

jay.  Garlic.  I think we did use garlic in an attempt to repell Angelus once -- so it must work to some extent.  And vampires as a symbol -- well, I guess they're the id -- the ungoverned part of human nature, and yes, certainly, sex is part of that.<BR>
<BR>
Phil-- yeah, the VERY disneyland-like place -- we couldn't believe Disney allowed it -- it was a Disney show, shot on the lot, taking this huge swipe at them!<BR>
<BR>
Lady W -- the special thrill of working on Buffy is that it is my favorite show.  And on a day-to-day basis it's just fun to write because of the more natural st<i></i>yle of writing compared to sitcoms, combined with good solid joke writing.    Best of both worlds.<BR>
<BR>
Okay... gotta go.  Heading out to my fave Chicken 'n Waffle joint for a nutritious dinner!

jay -- I promise you, I do not get bored talking about myself!  Please y'all -- ask anything, I don't mind!!!  Except that I've got to go soon.<BR>
<BR>
SarahNicole -- haven't seen such a thing around, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Eire, thanks and nice to meet you!<BR>
<BR>
mudpuppy:  You are related to Dava Savel... a famous and respected comedy writer.  I only met her once (she left the show before I joined it), but she is friends of friends of mine -- this is a small community.  Cool.<BR>
<BR>
Swoop  --  well, sort of.  We all have to be able to do everyone.  But I like to think I do Anya very well.  And I think Doug Petrie does Faith better than anyone else does.  And Marti is very very good at Buffy...  But it's not like I'd knock on their doors and say... hey can you write all the Buffy lines for me, or anything.<BR>
<BR>
About the PBP invitations... they haven't arrived yet... but if I just showed up they'd let me in, right?

<DD>Okay... winding down now... just a few more:<BR>
<BR>
David'schick -- yeah, "Not the mama!" that was us.  (you haven't lived til you've seen a room of 11 men + me pitching jokes in a baby dinosaur voice).  I got to Buffy from there by being determined to work on the best show on TV.<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen -- no more Angels this season, but I'd love to do another one next year.<BR>
<BR>
XG -- haven't seen Scream 3 yet.<BR>
<BR>
jay -- hmmmm.  rules for vampires.  Um, lets see.  You have to stake 'em or behead 'em (or hit in heart with wooden arrow).  Shooting 'em with metal bullets doesn't work.  They can't be in direct sunlight.  They don't turn into bats or sleep in coffins.  They do sleep.  They can eat food but they don't need to.  They can live off animal blood, but it's not as tasty and satisfying.  Um...  they lack souls (kinda the same thing as a conscience.)  You have to feed off THEM to be made into a vamp.  They live a long long time.  They hate crosses.  They don't like holy water.   Hm...   what did I leave out?

Ooof!  Little Willow!  Yes - your name was in 12 (sort of accidently)  and it got cut!  I'm so sorry!  Remember when Giles stops Spike from going to get Buffy.  Originally Spike said:  "Oh, embarrassment.  That's my favorite human emotion.  Makes the blood go to the skin.  Little Willow does it 'specially well."   Too bad it was cut.<BR>
<BR>
oritam -- for a long time my agent said he wouldn't be able to get me drama work (as opposed to sitcom) because I didn't have a feature spec... but I got Buffy with an NYPD Blue spec.  And feature specs are pretty much no help for getting sitcom work.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius -- Oh YEAH -- season 6 -- we're a huge moneymaker of a show, as I understand it -- great demos, great marketting ...  no one's gonna let us get away, I promise.  <BR>
<BR>
About getting ideas for monsters -- we tend to start from the real life problem and then invent a monster that embodies it.  Make sense?

Hi, sorry, I don't know anything about any magazine spoilers or any Buffy films or a music contest and I haven't heard anything about Buffy going to England I don't know what a "one off" is -- gee -- I sound fairly useless, huh?<BR>
<BR>
Phil -- I was only on Dinosaurs very briefly at the end of the last season.  I wrote "Variations on a Theme Park" and shared credit on another one whose name I forget at the moment.  <BR>
<BR>
corina-- I wrote a lot of amateur scripts that I never sent to anyone.   And I started a lot that I never finished.  But  I hit it lucky with the second script I sent to Star Trek TNG -- they didn't want to produce it, but they invited me into pitch ideas and that's how I got started.  My first produced script was the Dinosaurs ep mentioned above.  (several full years after the Star Trek invitation, btw.)</SMALL>

Okay, lots of people seem to want to hear about this:<BR>
Xander hasn't had a lot to do this year, I agree... but that will change.  But Giles... this year we had our first Giles-centric ep since "The Dark Age" -- the character is more peripheral in Buffy's life at the moment, but the actor is actually doing quite a lot.   <BR>
<BR>
About IWRY... I'm sure that wouldn't have got past us... every second of every ep is watched hundreds of times.  Maybe he said "Shhush" not "Sarah"?<BR>
<BR>
And yeah... we are planning way ahead... certainly talking about seasons five and six.  I didn't know about any season seven talks, but I might have been out writing when that happened.

Hi darkness, our inspiration mostly comes from Joss... just watching him *think* is amazing.  Other than that we mostly think about emotional events from our own college days.<BR>
<BR>
Lady W is asking about agents.  All of us on the show have different agents (although my agent also recently began repping one of the Angel writers).   You can get a list of film and TV agents from the Writers Guild of America -- the list indicates which ones will look at unsolicited material.  These are not, of course, the big famous agencies... you get to have an agent there after you've had a few early sales.  The main thing about any agent is that they get nothing until you make money... then they get only 10%.

First, I meant "sound," not "wound."<BR>
<BR>
Hi devil, DeMoriel, MedusA, EvilSIT!<BR>
<BR>
Crossbow... I remember that I actually had something in mind when I referred to "Buffy gets the thing that does the thing"  --  I wonder if I meant the letter opener in A New Man?

Monique -- great question.  Well, in this case I was writing a scene in which I knew Buffy had to ask Riley to T-giving and that he was supposed to have family plans.  And I realized I needed to make the plans wound very specific and very appealing (to make Buffy feel more driven to make her Tgiving perfect) -- so I just thought, well, if I have to be specific, let's be specific with something I know about.  So I made it Iowa, knowing that if Joss disagreed he'd tell me to change it.  He never told me to change it and thus it became part of our little world.  Things like that are very much why I love TV.

Phil -- the Roseanne reference you saw was probably for Joss, who wrote on the show in a very early season, or, just possibly a reference to an early "spec" Roseanne I wrote (an unproduced ep written solely as a writing sample)<BR>
<BR>
Lady W... hmm...you want info, huh?   well they start shooting my next ep on Monday and I can tell you this... It involves an insane number of props!
