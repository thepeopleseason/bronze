<dd>Kathypg:  Cleveland would be my best bet.  I’ll be back to work come July.  I’ll get in touch and see what’s what.  Thanks!<br><br>The Great One:  Good to see you.  Or read you, or whatever.  TV scripts are generally between 52 and 55 pages long.  Some shows, like Gilmore Girls, tend to run longer because of the fast-paced dialogue.  On BTVS and Angel, we shoot for 54 pages, which seems to work out great for us.<br><br>That’s all for this sleepy *******.  Special thanks to Malum Forma for the cool Steve DeKnight song.  And all of you go see Blue Crush next week!  It was written by a dear friend of mine, the amazing Lizzy Weiss.  Go!  Steve commands you!<br><br>Peace in the all the right places,<br>Big Steve DeKnight<br><br>

<dd>Kiba Rika:  Well I sure haven’t seen the sing along video.  For the love of Mitch Miller, send me one!<br><br>Ojagwers:  Since we of the Angel ilk are a small but true band, yes, more producing stuff is required.  Same goes for the amazing Mere Smith.  And yes, the rumors are true.  Jumpin’ Jeff Bell has taken over the day to day Rear Admiraling of the show, and we couldn’t be happier.  Not to say we didn’t really like David Simkins – a nicer man you will not meet.  Just a really tough job to walk into.  We all wish him the best.<br><br>Okay kids, one more round and little Stevie needs his rest.<br><br>

<dd>Thoin:  Damn.  Finally cuaght me.  All right, have Allyson or Tiggy forward me an email with your address and I'll fork over the goods.  Honest.  All signed and everything.  Possibly even by me.  Right now we're breaking 7, which is my next ep.  We finished the bulk of filming on one and it's being assembled into a thing of beauty.  Action!  Adventure!  Romance!  Intrigue!  an that's just the commercials.<br><br>Slayerdaddy:  Now that sounds like a plan.<br><br>
