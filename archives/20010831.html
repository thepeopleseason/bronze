<dd>shygirl:  It's always time for pokes and giggles.<br><br>Ergoshakes: Love those underroos.<br><br>Xanderella:  80-20.  No!  20-80!  Heck, I don't know.<br><br>Uhp!  Getting pulled into a meeting!  Hugs and pokes and heck, I'll be back next week!<br><br>

<dd>Stake:  In Spiral, Joss had several things that he wanted to hit.  Buffy's fear in the top of Act One.  Her being off balance.  Her collapse at the end.  And of course the Winnebago chase.  The chase is actually a good example of the process.  Joss says, "Knights chase Winnie.  Fight.  Giles impaled in the end."  Then I work out the details in the outline.  Hope that helps.<br><br>Ergoshakes:  Had one today.  Hot off the grill from our wonderful Buffy cooks.  Mmm.  Turkey.<br><br>Allyson:  Okay, I did it.  Man, that Fury has minty breath!<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Blast that internet!  All our evil plans revealed!  Auto destruct!  Auto destruct!  Phhtt!<br><br>Gotta run soon, so get in your in your last licks!<br><br>

<dd>newt:  I can reveal nothing about the musical, except that it's going to be one of the coolest things you'll ever see on TV.  Joss has outdone himself once again.  As for the Angel writers, they should always be treated as extra-special VIPS (unless they give away the color codes again).<br><br>Tiggy:  Tep.  They're finishing ep. 4 today.  Hey, you knocking Undressed?  Knock harder, girl!  Knock harder!<br><br>Clairel:  Steve DeKnight ain't saying nothin'.  Hey!  Put that gag back in, hula boy!<br><br>OldManFan:  The 3323 in Tiggy's name is obvious.  Add the numbers up and you get an 11, which is what she is, inside and out.<br><br>Wendy: Think I'd have to be here a couple more years before they'd let me direct, but sure!  Sounds like the fast road to an ulcer!<br><br>Stake: Can't go wrong with the leather.<br><br>

<dd>Sweet Tiggy of the South: Have fun on your mini.  Make it a major and I'm in.  And Hi right back to Paks.<br><br>Brassbow:  I'm not sure how the whole camera man thing works.  The technical side of television is still a bit of a mystery to me.<br><br>Tennis:  I have it on good authority that Sarah has quite a set of pipes.  And man oh man has Joss given her some beautiful songs to work with.<br><br>Essexgirl:  Joss has guidlines for certain beats that must happen in each episode.  Beyond that, we break the overall story as a group, then the writer who's doing that ep fleshes it out and adds a bunch of good bits in the outline.  <br><br>genrefan: Since brevity is the soul of wit, I shall be brief: Yes.<br><br>Risa:  Happy birthday!  Since you're fifteen, however, they'll be no talk of the state of my pants.  As for a cameo, I'd love to do one.  Probably wouldn't be until next season (7) at the earliest, if it ever happens.  Regarding Fray, yeah, how cool is that?  Great story, beautiful art.  Joss really nailed it.<br><br>

<dd>OzLady:  My big weekend plans are to finish unpacking my new pad.  Whoa! Big time Hollywood excitement.<br><br>Twilight:  I'm at the office today, and they have this funny rule about pants.  But the hula boxers are extra tropical.  I can almost feel the island breeze.<br><br>newt: Mighty Man eat mighty turkey burger.  Then smash puny dessert! Argghh!<br><br>OldMan Fan:  Halloween ep going great.  Two words on the costumes:  wooden shoes.<br><br>Kestra Troi:  You think it's cool now, but wait till I start hitting you up for money.<br><br>Wendy:  Who gave that away?!  Argghh!  Steve smash!<br><br>DeAN:  Will do.  I'm still pissed they canceled Freaks & Geeks.  Bunch of network bean-counting simians.<br><br>Stake:  I'm cool enough not to live by the numbers, baby.  I just want to be free to ride my machine without gettin' hassled by the Man.<br><br>
