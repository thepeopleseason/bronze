<DD><b>Kendra:</b>  Hi!  I'm fine thanks, you?<BR>
<b>Cobby:</b>  Sounds like a good plan!  come to L.A. and catch a show!<BR>
<b>m-CLOD-b:</b>  Well, if we haven't met before (I don't remember either), nice to meet you!  =)  And thank you!  Wait til you hear the new stuff we've got!  I can't WAIT for the next CD to come out.<BR>
<b>Piper:</b>  Well, usually when something nifty is going on with the band...like a nwe release, a TV appearance, whatever.  I'd say maybe once every couple of months.  <BR>
<b>Jennie:</b>  you're welcome, and bye!<BR>
<b>elusio:</b>  Cool!  Yeah, the credit card lacakge would be aproblem.  You could always send us an international money order, but that's a huge pain...  Anyway, I'm so flattered that I "inspire" anybody!  And yes, those UKPBFP's look like alittle TOO much fun!  lol<BR>
<b>Psyche:</b>  Hi!  How are you?  Just wanted to let you know that Elizabeth Anne just finished shooting a pilot for a new show called "Green Sails" in Australia.  She should hear soon whether or not the show is picked up.  She's the female lead on the show, a character she described to me as "a female McGyver."  hehe  I'll find out her character name later today, if you like.<BR>
<b>Hello:</b>  Hello!

First, you go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a> and sing up for our e-mail list.  Then, just send us a SASE and we'l send you a FREE sticker!  (We need the SASE because the postage on top of giving the stickers away free was just KILLING us.)  The address is:<BR>

<b>Candy:</b>  Big YAY back at ya!<BR>
<b>SarahNicole:</b>  Hi, you!  How are you?<BR>
<b>Cobby:</b>  Oh, you're very welcome! I wish we could, but as an unsigned, independent, completely self-funded band, that's a bit out of our budget at this point.  But you never know!!!

<DD><b>devil:</b>  No, I didn't!  I knew he was here, 'cause he came to our last show, but I didn't realize it was permanent.  Well, COOL.<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>(andJennie, Jacen, and anyone else who's interested...)  Darling Violetta's music was chosen as the new Angel theme.  I don't know if they wrote something specifically for the show, or if they submitted a work they'd already had, but that's the deal.  So, be happy for them!  =) (<i>And yes, we did submit our own instrumental theme, that we wrote specifically for Angel, but it's OK, we'll probably end up turning into a full-length song!)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Jennie:</b>  No, that's not boring, that's cool!  And I'd love a copy when it's done.<BR>
<b>Jacen:</b>  Thank you!  Well, I hope we get used sometime, but who knows?  We were lucky enough to be asked to submit a theme for Angel, (Many thanks to Chris Beck for contacting us about that!) but DV's theme was the final choice.
