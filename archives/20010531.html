<DD>Oh, yeah:  Re: T-Rex.  Who the hell are these guys?  I'm assuming they're brits, but I don't know them at all.  Then I see Billy Elliott (OH MY GOD WHAT A MOVIE) and all their songs sound like classics i've known all my life, except that I've never heard them.  Very intrigued.  Anyway, now's the time.  Be well, i'll be in touch.<BR>

<DD>Re:  Alan Moore.  I've no idea if he's a fan.  He did mention Buffy in the Giant ABC book (the Top Ten {best comic out there} story), but it was kinda dirty and I actually didn't like it.  (I'm protective of my kids).<BR>
<BR>
Re Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice:  They don't need me to put them to shame.  They should be feeling it anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Re:  suspense writing.   I don't know much, but I learned early on, in any given situation, make sure the worst possible thing happens.  Then something worse.<BR>
<BR>
Re:  Buffygirl.  I am shouting out to you.  Can you hear it from there?<BR>

<DD>Comes now the sleepy time of the night.  But a few more answers....  The songs will rhyme like actual songs.  I wouldn't call the show sondheim influnenced stylistically so much as thematically.  I'm trying to walk the line between pop and classic showtunes -  i.e. contemporary music with lyrics that move the narrative instead of just repeating.  RENT, Aimee Mann, Elvis Costello -- but again, the sound will be different from any of those cuz I have NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.  I just hope Chris Beck (And Jesse Tobias of Splendid, who I'm hoping will help produce it) can make it all sound coherent, not just a hodgepodge.  There will be much comedy and many heartfelt ballads, if it comes together AT ALL it'll have some classic moments.  That much I can promise.<BR>

If anyone sees KIBA, tell her she's kinda hot and I E'd her.  Tanx.

<DD>PhiL:  Fray was heavily scripted.  I find the Marvel style intriguing (Doug just did it with Gene Colan for the TAles of the Slayes Comic)  (Gene @#$#$@%&*@#$ Colan!  Sorry.  i'm cool now.) but i'm way too much of a control freak.  Er, I mean director.  No wait i'm...<BR>
<BR>
A Dancer!  Yes Numfar will be getting a spinoff, sort of like Soul Train but with crimesolving (And joy and honour and shame).  All those years with Alvin Ailey paid off BIG TIME!<BR>
<BR>
Let's talk about musicals.  Does anybody here realize how frikkin' HARD they are to write?  Why didn't anybody tell me about this?  Anyhoo, the musical ep is coming along nicely, at least it's fun torturing myself.  Can't wait to hear the songs sung by someone who's not me (Although Kai has been singing the girlparts for me, such pipes the dame has!  I could marry her!)

<DD>Now EVERYBODY'S posting about Fray!  Oh, I love you ALL! Group cyber-hug!  (It's just scary now.  He's like a monster.)  So, Fray is a comic about a slayer a few hundred years from now that is the first comic I ever wrote ever and I'm wicked excited about it.  I THINK it can be bought at Darkhorse.com, they're the publishers.<BR>
<BR>
The thing is, it's hard to find comics ANYWHERE outside the major urban areas.  Everyone says Comics are a dying industry.  But I want people to be able to find Fray, and this goes way beyond my shameless plugging.  I want people to feel what I did when I read comics as a kid.  I ran to the newstand every day (I didn't realiae they came out once a week, I went every day till they showed, I wasn't bright in the traditional sense) to find the latest issues of my favorite books, and I want kids to do that again.  But (old man speech coming)  when I grew up we didn't even have home video, let alone what we have now.  A movie came out, you saw it as many times as you could in the theatre before it left 'cause you would never see it again.  The only true epic you could bring home with you was a comic book.  Maybe they aren't needed anymore, but they're SUCH an extraordinary medium.  So even if it isn't FRAY, if people hate it, I want that medium to live on.  Superman.  Batman.  Planetary.  Whatever.  Comics shouldn't die.<BR>

<DD>Yes, I'm working on Angel with newcomer Brett Matthews.  We plot it out together, he writes the scripts and I edit and polish.  We're like a superhero team, except we don't have powers or costumes and we're pretty much okay with the idea of evil.<BR>
<BR>
The idea was to make the comic more comicky -- it felt like they were keeping too close to the show (my fault, by the way) so we decided to give him a rogues gallery and some over the top-cow action and sexiness. (hopefully not gratuitous).  We're doing a four issue arc and laying the seeds for further arcs.  It's big fun.

<DD>Ooh!  A question about FRAY!  Phil, you are my favorite Bronzer EVER!  I'm a whore.  There no nice way to say it.  Yes, Fray will be monthly.  Eight action and dialogue packed issues full of dialogue and action!<BR>
<BR>
Thoin -- CLOSET Sondheim fan?  He's the greatest influence in my life.  He's the man.  (We'll ignore PASSION.)  (la la la, PASSION never happened...hmmmm mmm....)

<DD>So, okay, proof.  I'm my biggest fan.  That's a little sad.<BR>
<BR>
But I'm not here to talk about (wonderful, glorious, not-as-jowly-as-photographs-might-indicate)<yello1295> me, I'm here to talk about my work.<BR>
<BR>
I'm here to talk about FRAY.<BR>
<BR>
(please buy it oh please but it what if nobody buys it I'm gonna feel so STUPID)<BR>
<BR>
which I would never stoop to PLUGGING here on the board, because that would be wrong.<BR>

(If it's any consolation, I have a lot of shame about the fact that I have no shame.)<BR>

<DD>I am me!  I can't believe I'm on the board with me!  Oh, I wish I could think of something clever to say to me, but.... I just love Buffy, and me, and everything I do (except Alien Ressurrection and X-men and almost every movie I've ever been involved with), Oh, that was so lame, anyway  hi me!  Is Buffy really dead?
