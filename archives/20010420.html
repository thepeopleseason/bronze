<DD>Vanessa:  Send me your cookies.  Send them!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!<BR>
<BR>
Micaiah:  Sex in the animated Buffy?  Why you dirty little bird!  It's a cartoon for kids!  So sadly, no.  But keep your eyes on next week's Buffy (in the US). That should keep you happy, you perv.<BR>
<BR>
Dunlin: More baby pictures to be posted soon.  I got one of me on the phone that'll kill you.<BR>
<BR>
Socks:  Am I writing a book?  Close.  Very close.<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo: Sure, I can help with a line.  Have your people call my people.  What, I work for free?  Getouttahere! *g*<BR>
<BR>
Okay, I gotta fly like an eagle, let my spirit carry me (try to get that tune out of your head).  You guys are the best, as always.  Hey, do me a great big favor, will you?  Next time any of you are around when Cairo posts, give her a huge hug from me.  Tell her I think her ideas and thoughts about Buffy are amazing and I hope to be able to post with her one day.<BR>
<BR>
That's it.  You can put your pants back on now.<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>tiggy3323:  Summer projects?  Yes, the animated Buffy is my number one project.  I have something else in the works, but it'll be a while before you'll see it.  Hint:  Not a movie, not a TV show.<BR>
<BR>
OldManFan:  Letting go of what you've written can be difficult.  The best cure for this is to work in TV.  There's no time to keep rewriting.  Other than that, don't beat the dead horse.  Move on to the next beast and ride it for all it's worth.<BR>
<BR>
Ergoshakes:  Steve "SansPants" DeKnight?  I may change it to this, but wrong!<BR>
<BR>
LittleHen:Steven "Sylvestor" DeKnight?  What am I, a puhdty cat?  Wrong!  As for DeKnight's Riders, just send Boo (the webmaster) an email.  Here's the Riders' web site: http://deknight.hypermart.net<BR>
<BR>
Mia:  Oh, go on with ya.  You'll get tired of my soon enough.  Lord knows all my friends have.<BR>
<BR>
Somebody asked me if the animated show is coming to the UK (sorry, can't find the post).  I really don't know.  I hope so.  It's gonna be great!

Corvus:  Steven "Sigmund" DeKnight?  What am I, a sea monster?  Wrong!<BR>
<BR>
Janni:  Steven "Sexy" DeKnight?  That's right, baby, but just on special occasions.  Usually, though -- wrong!<BR>
<BR>
Narrator "Steven "Stands For Nothin'" DeKnight?  Wrong!<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
laffin: Steven "Superfly Simpson Sebastain" DeKnight?  Sounds like royalty to me, but wrong!<BR>
<BR>
Lyndsay: Yes, I was a huge Buffy fan before I was on the show.  Had seen every episode.  Yes, would love to write an Angel.  Maybe next season...<BR>
<BR>
Little Hen:  Stomp stomp!<BR>
<BR>
Jj: The hardest story I had to write?  Blood Ties.  Of course, it was my first, so the pressure was on.  Spiral was much easier since I was more comfortable by the time I had to write it.

<DD>Corvus: Hey, I noticed you're not a member of DeKnight's Riders.  You trying to tell me something there, bub?  As for the contract negotiations, beats me.  But I think we'll know which network we're gonna be on soon.<BR>
<BR>
Willowy: Staring and drolling always works for me.  That's how I met my last girlfriend.<BR>
<BR>
laffin: Was what Doc said about seeing someone who looked like Spike one of those hints we put in?  Could be.  Or maybe not.  Keep watching.<BR>
<BR>
Dunlin:  Follow the crowd...follow the crowd... follow the crowd...<BR>
<BR>
Teen AK: Can't read the fanfic unless it's published.  Pesky lawsuits when you guys have the same ideas as we do.<BR>
<BR>
Boo:  Boo!  My man!  Great job on the DeKnight's Riders site.  I thank you from the bottom of my elfin little heart.  More pics on the way.  Took a few (very few) at the wrap party last week.<BR>
<BR>
genrefan:  Thanks!  Yes, Blood Ties was my first official script for Buffy.  Next up is Spiral on May 8.  Right now I'm working on a couple of episodes for the animated show.  Then it's back to Buffy Prime as soon as the new season starts.

<DD>DeAN:): Will I promise not to write an eppy that'll emotional wreck you?  Hmmm... that depends.  How do you feel about the senseless stomping of cute fuzzy bunnies?  Perhaps you should avoid episode 20.<BR>
<BR>
Slayerdaddy: cartoons of the 70's are our guiding light. "Gee, Davey..."<BR>
<BR>
Amberlynne: I don't know if I was destined to be a Buffy writer, but my background certainly prepared me for it.  I grew up on a steady diet of monster movies and comic books.  Working on Buffy is pure heaven for an arrested development case like me.<BR>
<BR>
Jj's MUM:  Hmmm... I'm not sure who Joss is related to.  As for advice in writing a script, make sure you're using the right format and, most importantly, outline outline outline.  Know exactly where your story is going before you start the actual writing.  On Buffy, we usually do a 15-page outline for a 50-page script.  Very, very important.<BR>
<BR>
wiccan willow:  Okay, I'll talk to you.  How ya doing?<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323:  Doing great.  And yes, water would be dandy.  I need my 8 glasses a day to maintain this lovely alabaster skin.<BR>
<BR>
LittleHen:  Thanks.  Steven S. DeKnight is my actually name.  Grew up with it and everything. Hey, ten points for anyone that can tell me what the "S" really stands for.  Yes, it is hard not spilling the beans about what's coming up on Buffy to my friends.  Especially when I see a rough cut of an episode weeks in advance, and then my addled brain thinks it's already aired and I can talk about it.  Haven't let anything important slip yet though.

<DD>In the interest of time, I may not actually respond to everyone by name.  Don't be offended -- I love all you little stalkers equally.  So, here's a heap o' answers for ya!<BR>
<BR>
Can you read my Xander the Slayer script?  Not at the moment.  I'm pitching it as a possible episode of the animated series. <BR>
<BR>
Fav episode this season?  Liked a ton of them, but I must bow down to The Body.  Cried like a baby, felt like a wet rag for a day and a half.  Joss is da man.<BR>
<BR>
Did I study writing in school?  Yes.  I actually trained as a playwright.  Undergrad work at UC Santa Cruz, grad work at UCLA, where I also hung around an extra year to study screenwriting.  Was it beneficial?  Big fat yes. Best money I ever spent (well, still spending, but Buffy's gonna help pay those loans next season).

<DD>Yo ho ho.  A fine pantless Friday to you all.  Let me jump right in with a little story for Geo...<BR>
<BR>
How did I become a Buffy writer?  A strange story that I still can't believe happened.  I was toiling on MTV's Undressed when I decided to try to make the move to one-hour dramas.  I was a big Buffy fan, so I decided to write a spec episode since I knew that show the best.  I cranked out a story about Xander becoming the Slayer, polished it up, and sent it to my agent.  I didn't think anything would happen with it, since my agent at that time was mainly features and really didn't have many contacts in TV.  But as fate would have it, she did know the wonderful people over at Mutant Enemy, Joss' company.  So she got them to read it.  They liked it and called me in for an interview.  They told me up front that they weren't hiring any new writers on Buffy, but they were interested in possibly hiring for the animated Buffy that they were developing.  I told them I'd love to, but they said first Joss had to read my script.  They warned me that he usually didn't like any of the Buffy specs he read.  A side note: Usually in TV you never send a spec episode of a show to that very same show.  The reason is that the people who work on the show know it better than anyone else, and are much more critical of material dealing with their world.  <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, weeks go by, Joss finally reads it, and wonder of wonders, really likes it.  I go in and meet with him, and after about a half an hour of chewing the sweet Buffy fat, he drops the bomb on me.  "Listen," he said, "I know they were talking about you working on the animated show, but how would you feel about writing an episode of the live action?"  Gee, tough call.  Heck yeah!  So, long story short, I wrote Blood Ties, Joss liked it and offered me a full-time gig.  Which leads to the undeniable conclusion that I am indeed the luckiest boy in the world.
