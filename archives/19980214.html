<dd>A big postingboard hello to all of our "in spirit only" PBP attendees. <STRONG>We miss you!!!!</STRONG> But, congrats, you overloaded UltimateTV and you took Tripod offline looking at the pictures. Wow! We'll have many more pictures online, probably tomorrow, and eventually, we'll have a permanent location (not really 'we'll', since it's the PBP committee that will be doing it). Now, I'm going to turn the computer over now, enough babbling out of me. Take care!<br>

<dd>Let's try to do this in one: Sparklez - haven't been back to the set for a while so I haven't gotten any mail, but thanks. Shout out to RYDINI.. No verdict on the ANgel /Oz standoff, but who knows? I should announce I'm joining the regular cast next season, thanks for your support...hope you don't get sick of me too soon. My hair's been changing cause I've been doing film work in between episodes of Buffy, and like to change my look for different parts - Joss has been cool enough to write it into the story line. Haven't seen Jenny68, but I'm on the lookout. <br>

What is this club with the van? You do know the van changes as often as my stupid hair, right? And lastly, I don't know the details of the summer place stuff, you should query Marti Noxon...OOPS! Aly just stopped in and started rubbing my knee, so I can't concentrate....<br>
