<b>Paris_Angel:</b>  Hey!  Actually, she was down here working on a lot of stuff with us, but we weren't touring.  (I wish we were touring...I love to tour!)  It was great, though.  She's a great girl!  =)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, <b>ED1_faith, Cleio, and J Doe.</b>  I am really looking forward to them!  =)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Swoop:</b>  Well, the weather's fine, the earthquake was way far away, and I'm used to them now!  (How sick is <i>that?</i>)

<b>Angelique's Faith:</b>  Nice to meet you , too.<BR>
<b>{dru}:</b>  Hello...well, I like sports to a degree - especially gymnastics, diving, that sort of thing - but I'd be annoyed if they were preempting Buffy for the Olympics!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Balf:</b>  Hehehe...yep, I never get that!  (But I honestly <i>never</i> get tired of hearing it, so thanks!)  And you're right, we won't be touring an international tour anytime soon.  But hey!  You never know, right?  (Stranger things have happened....)

<b>Swoop:</b>  Cool!  I know it wasn't a very "deep" quote, but it's true, at least!  =)<BR>
<b>Cleio:</b>  Things are great.  Busy, but great.  No new gigs til November, 'cause we're working on two CD's right now.  (A live one and a studio one.)<BR>
<b>ED1_faith:</b>  Hi!  Nice to meet you...sorry you missed that gig, but it was on a Monday, so I understand completely!<BR>
