Kristen, that's a great review! I mean it, very well written.<BR>
And I laughed out loud at the swiss cheese comment!<BR>
<BR>
Now I really mean it, I've gotta go. How do you Bronzer's say it?...*poof*

On Netscape now, so no more "swearing" at the bottom of my posts!<BR>
Scram, we'll see. Hoope its not a problem. Note that I heard it might only be a problem for SA and VIC.<BR>
To those who asked, I am from Adelaide. (Sempahore Park to be exact).<BR>
<BR>
Lurking B (love that screen-name)you asked about the credit: it has now reached the point where I basically write all the music for Angel. Occasionally I might use one of Chris's themes, but as he mentioned earlier the heroic Angel theme is used less and less lately as the show tends to focus more on the souls he is saving. Then again we had "The Prodigal: which was so much fun learning his history.<BR>
<BR>
Ajo thanks for compliments on "Under my Skin". I personally loved the twists in that episode.<BR>
Hollyn: Thanks!<BR>
Jessie: Thanks too!<BR>
TUBLUVIN: I never ralized there were so many Aussies on this board!<BR>
<BR>
LadyJack: I don't blame you. I really only checked out the Bronze tonight to see if it was actually HERE.<BR>
<BR>
I'm gonna hit the hay now, I think. Cheers all.
