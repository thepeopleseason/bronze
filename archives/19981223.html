grr argh<BR>

I just missed my flight because I can't find my work permit.  I can go to Canada but I can't come back.  I came to the studio, from whence I type, to look further... to no avail.  Sucking on a grapefruit didn't help either.  I'm booked on a business class seat tomorrow AM (it's all they had available... cost me a cacaload of money...) but I'm not even sure I'll find it by then.<BR>
<BR>
OK posting is making me feel slightly better.<BR>
