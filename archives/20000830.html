<DD>Ack! It's 1:15 am here, and I have lots of tedious stuff to do tomorrow - stuff that involves having a properly functioning cerebellum - so I'd better go.<BR>
<BR>
<b>suekib:</b>  We were only used in the first season, actually...I don't know if they'll be using us again.  We're surrently being used a LOT on this new show on MTV, though.  (It's called "Live Through This."  Nowhere near Buffy-caliber, but HEY - it's exposure!)  ;-)<BR>
<b>Amelia:</b>  My fave VC CD is the newest one:  "Moody Groove Music."  =)<BR>
<BR>
<b>TMorel:</b>  If you'e out there, say hi to Jennie and FSM for me!  =)<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>

<b>Claris:</b>  Hi, there!  LW says hi, too.<BR>
<b>ihybernate:</b>  Wasn't it a good show?  I would LOVE to see it again, but unfortunately I'm busy.  Are you seeing it again?

<DD><b>Olivia:</b>  <i>Adulation???<i> hehehe  Um...I honestly like the color 'cause I can see my own posts easier.  (I'm basically just lazy.)  *g*<BR>
<b>Fairy_star_child:</b>  My fave line from Angel is actually from when Spike did his crossover ep:  "Not the hair!  Never the hair!  I'm out of that Nancy-boy hair gel I like so much."  lol  There are too many cool lines from Buffy - and I'm to tired to think about them all right now.  hehe

<DD>Is <b>Prophet6</b> still around?  He'll never believe I'm up this late.  ;-)  And I must tell him how I almost got in an accident trying to dial Star98.7 on my cell phone when they announced the call-in contest to meet Duran Duran the other day!  (I didn't win.  *sigh*)

<DD>Hey!  I'm actually awake during LOSERS!  ;-)  Just thought I'd drop by quickly to say hi and that I <i>loved</i> "The Why" - a play featuring both the lovely and talented James Marsters and the amazing Noah Wyle.  I saw it Monday night with <b>Little Willow, andyourlittledogtoo,</b> and <b>DreamLurker.</b>  It rocked.  =)
