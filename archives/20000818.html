<DD>NuPhalanx--the book's called Spike & Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row, and it'll be out October 1st.<BR>
<BR>
And that's all for me.  Good night, folks.<BR>
<BR>
I hope everyone comes down to my California signings next week.<BR>
<BR>
Be well.

<DD>Kristen--Thanks for the kind words about the MB, but why does Minear get a point for it.  color me confused.<BR>
<BR>
Zeus--hope to see you there.<BR>
<BR>
Lord MM--I was a little busy on the Monster Book.  I mean, have you SEEN that . . . well, MONSTER?  It's huge, and even then it's several hundred pages shorter than our first draft.<BR>
<BR>
Vanessa and Anti--you're both cruel to me.

<DD>Vanessa--As The Simpsons Mr. Burns would say, re: Jello.  Huzzah!<BR>
<BR>
Lord MM--That'd be Nancy and her west coast crew.<BR>
<BR>
Lady W & LilBufx2--hey there!  No sleep . . . and no, not real.<BR>
<BR>
Anti--I e'd Claris.  She e'd back.  wuwt?  : )<BR>
<BR>
To all--in case Little Willow hasn't told the world yet, I'll be signing on Tues. night in Burbank, CA at Dark Delicacies, from 7-9.  Then on Sat. the 26th at Mysterious Galaxy in San Diego from, I think, 12:30 to 1:30.  I hope some of you SoCal'ers will swing by.
