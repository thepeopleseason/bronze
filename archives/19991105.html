<b>Charity</b>  That's been fixed, thank goodness!  =)  How come you don't have transportation to the show???

You can get BOTH "Warm" and "The Buffy EP" from <a target='_blank' href="http://www.towerrecords.com">www.towerrecords.com</a> or <a target='_blank' href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a> or you can go to a Tower Reocrds or bor<i></i>ders Books and Music near you to pick up "The Buffy EP."  (Not the soundtrack...it's our own CD.)  But "Warm" is only available online.  And nice to meet you, too!<BR>

<b>Buffyenta:</b>  LOL...I don't know if the "letter" was ever written or actually received...but the irony is, I just received a 100% shop from a "secret shopper," and our store manager personally congratulated me and bought me lunch, so that ought to offset things when/if she gets the letter.

<DD><b>NuPhalanx:</b>  Yes, the RL has been rather nutzoid lately.  Eek.  ;-)<BR>
<b>Jasmen:</b>  Well, do your best.  This show is going to top all the other shows.  (Both guitarists on stage for the set, new backing vocals added, new songs...) But I so understand if you're busy.  Good luck with all your stuff!

<DD><b>raptamama:</b>  Not recently, thank the lord!  =)  But I get my share...there's at least one semi-evil customer per day, and a bona fide MANIAC about once a week.  hehehe<BR>
<b>Kali56:</b>  LOL.....nope.  I'm just hanging out.  Resting.  Something I don't do nearly enough of!  =)  (And I have a gig on Sunday, then a live webcast on Tuesday, then another gig on Friday, so I'd better rest while I can!!)<BR>
<b>ceridwen:</b>ROCKIN'!  Very cool.  I am SOOOOO excited that this show is ALL-AGES, too!  That is a total plus, in my book.  Now the "under-18's" don't have to buy dinner, if they don't want to.  =)</SMALL>
