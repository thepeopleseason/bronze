<DD><b>vampire_angel01</b>:  Actually, I've never tried to visit the set!  So I have no idea whether or not they'd let me on!  lol  As for being on the show again, who knows?  There's a great song on the new album that just SCREAMS Buffy and/or Angel, so we'll see.  =)<BR>

<DD><b>Mesuvius:</b>  Hey, there!  Yeah, well my car is sitting at the bodyshop now, waiting for the insurance adjuster to go down and give the OK for them to start work on it.  I hate red tape, don't you?<BR>

<DD>RSO's to <b>ElieAngel, Vaedus, SusieQ, & Starr!</b><BR>

<b>ElieAngel:</b>  Unfortunately, we don't have any international distribution, but you can ALWAYS order any of our CDs from our site, and we'll send them to you!  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<b>vaedus:</b>  LOL...hey, there!  You been layin' down on the job?<BR>
<b>Jasmen:</b>  Hi, there  =)<BR>
<BR>
Everybody:  For what it's worth, I agree with those who have said it's better to leave well enough alone.  Backfire-age is a major possibility, and I say we should mind our own business on this one.  IMHO
