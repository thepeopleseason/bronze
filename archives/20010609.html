<DD>Just another minute:<BR>
<BR>
ARANA:  good call on the lack of Xander moment.  We had a speech by him about how Buf inspires him, but it got cut due to time and dramatic flow.  But it did belong, thematically speaking.<BR>
<BR>
hi REVOLVER.<BR>
<BR>
Kiba:  My bad.  When I said you were "kinda hot" I meant "wicked hot".  sorry about that.  And Monkeys occassionally DO fly out of Steve DeKnight's butt.  It's kind of horrible.<BR>
<BR>
Really gotta go.  <BR>
<BR>
love,     <BR>

<DD>Oops, running out of cybertime.  No, i'm not doing Big Breakfast -- that show kind of scares me.  They're all very sweet but they're really UP and EXCITED and I'm not very good at that.  As for Ripper, it's BBC2 with whom I'm dealing, nothing is set yet but i am a determined sort of fellow.  <BR>
<BR>
Hey KIBA!<BR>
<BR>
And so I go.  I have much stretching to do before Britslayer arrives for rehearsal.  Remember, each and every one of you has, deep inside you, a pancreas.  Never forget that.   love, me.  (i mean LOVE ME!)<BR>
<BR>
cuz it's all about me.<BR>
<BR>
Except i can't exactly remember.... who that is....

<DD>That's better.  And now it's time I told you all the whole truth about the BRITSLAYER scandal.  It was a nightmare.  I very innocently tried to buy a comic, she told me to get in the back of the line.  i started screaming "Don't you know who I am?!?!" at the top of my lungs -- not because I'm so full of myself, but because I had actually forgotton who I was and hoped she might know.  Well, she took this the wrong way and pushed the little red button under the counter that releases the alligators.  Pandemonium followed, a lot of customers were eaten and in a way I blame myself.  But we all had a laugh afterwards, except for the dead and mutilated, and Britslayer and I are now  best friends and are planning to start an avant garde dance troupe cuz, you know, you can never have too many of those.<BR>
<BR>
There.  Now you know.

<DD>I've been reading the Sondheim bio, lots of stuff about waiting for the rewiews on opening night, and that's just how I feel about Fray this week.  Of course, I HATE it, can only see what's wrong with it, what was I thinking, etc.  Of course, that's my reaction to everything I write -- the only problem is, sometimes it's justified.  But I hope people like.  Working on ish four (Karl patiently waiting for new pages to draw) because the concept of vacation is one I've yet to master.  My wife is at the next computer and don't tell her this, but she's REALLY HOT.  Oops, got off the subject of ME for a moment, can't have that.  Sorry.  Me me me.  There.  I feel better.  So how are you guys?  (Please make sure your answers relate to ME in some way or I will not be able to understand them).

<DD>Hey, passing through the cyberplex in London, saying hi to you, the fans.  Well, to most of you.  Not the ones I have a grudge against, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.  Actually, I never told anyone about the grudge so you might not.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.  But you're in big trouble, I can tell you that.  The rest of you, though, hey, howsit goin'?
