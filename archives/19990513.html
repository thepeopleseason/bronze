<DD>Yeah!  I want col<i></i>or codes!  demmit.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know what the Daily news said.  We did have to make som minor trims in the finale that again I could not argue with, but nothing that really affects the story.  An unfortunate line or two, a trim of one action.  Trust me, i wouldn't let them gut the show.  Are they panicking?  Maybe.  But the show is the show, it's very much a fantasy with a pro-humanity message and that comes through.  It'll be cool.  It's not the MATRIX, for god's sake.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of which, that one scene (trechcoats, guns) made me very uncomfortable.   Having noted that, I think the Matrix is one of the finest and most important SciFi movies ever made.  After I saw it, I wanted to put down my pen and say "I'm sorry, i won't use this again until I've learned how."  Nifty.

<DD>On the inevitable subject, as far as pre-empting the ep, I agreed with the decision and when you see it you'll agree, I think, that it was just badly timed.  But it WILL air.  I'm proud of it.  It comments on that type of sitch, and obviously we come down AGAINST massacreing people, but ANY comment after so desperate a tragedy would be offensively trite.  Nedless to type, this BLAME THE MEDIA thing makes me crazy.  Remember when dan quayle blamed the LA riots on Murphy Brown?  Everybody laffed, but NOBODY TALKED ABOUT THE RIOTS ANYMORE.  It's just a way of avoiding the subject -- and of amking sense of something to ugly to deal with by latching onto a scapegoat.  Sigh.  (But it is Marilyn Manson's fault.)<BR>
<BR>
How's that pity comin'?

<DD>Hey.  My computer's been @%$#&*ed, so's no posto fer a while.  Just wanted to say hi.  Had meant to get on and tell you that the pre-empted ep was pretty much a stand alone, which I guess was lucky -- although when you see it, a few of the things that came after will make more sense, or have more resonance, anyhoo.  My insane life means that we are just editing the finale AND already hard at work on the next season of Buff AND of Angel.  Pity me.  I demand your pity!
