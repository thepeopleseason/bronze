<DD>kenickie:  You work on Queen and Country?  What do you do on it?  I haven't picked those up yet, but now I will this weekend to support you, mighty Bronzer!<BR>
<BR>
DowntownApartments: Sweet pickle.  Labyrinth or Goonies?  Hmmm... both have their drawbacks.  I'd have to go with Labyrinth.  Anything with David Bowie in it gets the big win.<BR>
<BR>
biobabe:  Fine taste in movies too?  Stop, you're killing me.<BR>
<BR>
PR Wench:  They'll be plenty of hot man-on-man action next season.  Oh, wait a minute -- you mean ON the screen?<BR>
<BR>
bdbdb:  Go on with you!  *blush, giggle*<BR>
<BR>
Okay, gotta fly.  Hugs and pokes, as always.  Special squeezes to Boo and Tiggy for doing DeKnight's dirty work (hee hee hee).  Until next time -- don't let the man keep you down!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>tiggy:  I only speak the truth (as far as you know).  Ep 5 is in the early early early outline stage.  I will give you all one little smidge of info:  Halloween.  Boo, I say, boo!<BR>
<BR>
biobabe:  Now you're using the word "super" on me? Why you saucy little monkey!  You think you can beguile me with your Canadian charms, you -- you -- uh, hey, look at all the pretty flowers...<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  Bless you, sweet woman.  Now if I can only figure out how to button these pants...<BR>
<BR>
Diablo:  Ah yes, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  I liked it, even bought the DVD, but I had problems with the movie.  I thought it was beautiful, but ultimately fell into the standard kung-fu movie trap of an incomprehensible plot.  But heck, the fight scenes were cool. Don't know how many eps I'll be writing this season.  Probably at least two.<BR>
<BR>
Holly: Sorry to hear you got knocked around.  Kids can pretty much suck.  Hope you have a better time of it in LA.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  I see your "hi" and raise you a "fine how do ya do."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, last round, then nap time for big baby Steve.

<DD>Beldin:  Drew Greenberg, Master of All He Surveys.<BR>
<BR>
kenickie:  Marvel Mature?  You bet!  It's about time they caught up with DC Vertigo.  (Whoops!  My geek just fell out!)<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  My door is always open.  Unless it's locked, which means I'm hiding under the bed again.  Loud noises startle me.<BR>
<BR>
Molly:  Doing great!  Monkey drinks master's wine!  Bad monkey, bad!<BR>
<BR>
DowntownApartments: Drew worked for the US Queer as Folk, I believe, although I might have dreamed it (along with that big Dagwood sandwich.  Mmm... sandwich!).<BR>
<BR>
Circe:  Really liked Momento.  Last one I saw was Moulin Rouge (sp?).  Thought half of it was brilliant.  The other half lulled me into a deep sleep.

<DD>Okay, this new board thing is screwing me up.  Read all your questions on the old board, but can't remember most of them (it's a wee jammed in my teeny coconut today.  So this'll be a short round.<BR>
<BR>
Tiggy:  Little slow on the e these days, but you're the first person I think about when I sit down in front of my computer.  E soon, I promise.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Somebody asked a question about Glory/Ben and the Knights.  Okay, one last time.  The Knights weren't formed to fight Glory.  They were formed to find and destroy the Key, which has existed in our dimension for just this side of forever.  Glory was cast out from her Hell dimension and into baby Ben around twenty-five years ago.  She only recently gained the strength to emerge from her "prison".  Hope that clears it up.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, CK has amazing eyes.  There, I said it.  Whew!  That's a load off my chest!

<DD>biobabe: Okay, so you're a hella cute scientist/actress AND you use the word "swell"?  What are you doing in Canada -- get down here.<BR>
<BR>
Sparrow:  I don't suck up.  I apply gentle pressure with my sweet soft lips on exposed backsides.  It's a whole different vibe.<BR>
<BR>
@lex H:  Season Six is going to be a lighthearted romp filled with hugs, happy endings, and even a new character -- Rainbow, the Lovable Scamp.  Or we might just kill everybody.  We haven't decided yet.<BR>
<BR>
Circe:  Haven't seen the amazing Allyson's Variety Comps yet.  But the other office monkeys may have sucked them up.  Bad monkey, bad!<BR>
<BR>
kronos:  I bound so others don't have to.  It's a heavy weight, but one I'm willing to carry for the good of society.<BR>
<BR>
Holly:  There are lots of great places to live in LA.  Unfortunately, how nice they are is usually in direct proportion to $$$.  I lived in Glendale for years, and that's a really safe place.  Now I'm moving to Santa Monica, which is pure heaven.  I'll be the one with wings and a halo.<BR>
<BR>
singsin the car:  Nope, nothing in the mail yet.  Maybe you'd better send another copy through UPN.  I'll check out that site as soon as I can.<BR>
<BR>
AussieBulldog:  I've scheduled a refreshing nap, then a trip to the gym to sling the heavy iron (how far I sling it remains to be seen).<BR>
<BR>
Evalie:  Nope, just writing ep 5.  I was slated to do 7, but got bumped up because I'm all that.  Okay, not the real reason, but I've always wanted to work "all that" into a sentence.<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  I'm always happy to wake up a princess.  Lots of news from Buffy Central.  We're bursting with cool ep ideas.  I'd tell you all about 'em, but kinda still liking my job.<BR>
<BR>
soules techwriter:  The Disney Fellowship is very popular.  Start breaking arms.  If you need any help, let me know.<BR>
<BR>
Stake: Big fan of the X-Files, especially the early seasons.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so too many of you and not enough me.  I'm not going to be able to answer everybody, but I promise I will read all your questions.  Well, at least every third word.

<DD>Divaliving:  Hey, you wouldn't be a Porter College slug, would you?  If so, whoo and hoo!<BR>
<BR>
Taliesin:  I'm more surrreal than Dali's moustache (actually, I'm wearing Dali's moustache -- the miracle of ebay).<BR>
<BR>
Satine:  Yes, big things up ahead.  Or possibly just a big head.  Either way -- score!<BR>
<BR>
Sparrow:  Now you're talking.  RV Knight Battles -- that's why I got into the business in the first place.  No, wait -- I mean for the girls!  Definitely for the girls!  Aw heck, who am I kidding?<BR>
<BR>
genrefan:  Yup.  Season Six, busy busy busy and soooooooo good.  Go sit in front of the TV and don't move.  You won't want to miss a second.<BR>
<BR>
souless techwriter:  Gossip you say?  Well, I heard Julia Roberts was cheating on her beau.  What is she, nuts?  I'm about as straight as they come, but hey -- that's one fine hunk of man.<BR>
<BR>
Uh, is it hot in here or it just me?

<DD>Hola (or hula, as the case may be), beutiful bright Bronzers!  Released early this good pantsless Friday, so here I am in all my semi-nekkid glory.  Okay, uh, "glory" may actually be stretching it a bit, but here I am anyway.

<DD><b>Silent Orchid:</b>  You have e-.  =)<BR>
<b>Zeus:</b>  LOL!  So, you're getting a new one, eh?  Good...the old one was getting a tad ratty!  J/K!!!  <BR>
<b>singsinthecar:</b>  Well, here are the details I have so far.  I know it's open to the public, and it will cost $8 to get in, and they're building a theater on one of the soundstages at the old WB lot in Santa Monica.  It's a midnight screening on Friday night, July 27th, as part of the Dances With Films Festival, and I will definitely be there.  That's all I know.  =)<BR>
<BR>
I should get going...<BR>
<BR>
If anyone happens to watch <b>Sex And The City</b> this Sunday, listen for Velvet Chain!  ;-)<BR>

<DD>Hi back to everybody, and I'm doing just fine, thanks for asking!  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Silent Orchid:</b>  Nope, I'm not kidding.  "You Got Me" really is going to be on Sex And The City this Sunday!  But I don't have cable, so I can't see the show...so I was hoping someone might be willing to tape it for me!  =)  If you are willing and able, then THANK YOU!<BR>
<b>Princess of Darkness:</b>  Hi!  Thanks...I think I did.  I'll look through our evil, overloaded inbox later and see if I can find it!  =)<BR>
<b>singsinthecar:</b>  Yay!  Good choice!  The fan club is a nifty thing.  =)<BR>
<BR>
I have more good news, actually...  I got a really cool write-up in Songwriter's Monthly, AND the indie feature film I shot last summer is screening at the Dances With Films festival here in LA on Friday, July 27th.  Yay!  Can't wait to see myself on an actuall "BIG SCREEN!"  hehehehe  (I'm hyper today, forgive me...)

<DD>Greetings from Buffy Central.  As usual, I'm in and out of meetings all day, so this is just a drive-by.  I'll try to stop in for a longer stretch today, but if I can't we'll take over Sunday again.<BR>
<BR>
Hugs and Pokes for everyone, free of charge.
