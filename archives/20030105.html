<dd>One last post...<br><br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  You rock!  Thanks!  =)<br><b>The Partyman:</b>  Cool!  I played "Luisa," the wife.  It was actually the second time I've played the part...the first being in college, when I was just 18 years old!  hehehe  I'm still way to young for the role, but I guess I pulled it off!  ;-)<br><br>Bye again!<br>~Erika<br><br>

<dd><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Actually, it's with a brand-new label that will be bigger than an indie but smaller than the big nasty conglomerates.  ;-)  They're still in the structuring phase.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed!<br><b>princessfantastico:</b>  hehehe...Yeah, the costumes were pretty fun.<br><br>

<dd><b>Dualslayers:</b>  Hey!  Just saw you, there.  =)  Hugs back!<br><b>buffy5202:</b>  That depends on which CD you mean.  If you mean the new one, <b>Asteroid Belt</b>, well, that may be available everywhere, if things go well.  hehe  All our other CD's are available online at our secure website, <a href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank">www.velvetchain.com</a><br><b>OldManFan:</b>  that's right!  Hmmm...  I wonder if I'll get invited to hang out at the PBP again this year...  That would be fun!  But I'll definitely let you guys know if we or I am playing anywhere around then.  Which weekend it is on, exactly?<br><br>

<dd>Hi back to everybody!!  =)<br><br><b>CarpeDi:</b> So far, so good, thanks!<br><b>Dachelle:</b> Well, thank you very much!  Nice to meet you.  =)<br><b>Beldin:</b>  Hehehe...yeah, well, I keep auditioning for stuff, so you never know where I'll end up.  As for Jeff, yes, he's in the studio about 95% of the time.  And when he's not there, he's asleep...and a lot of the time, he just sleeps there!  LOL  And the acting's going well, thanks.  I was just named one of the best performances of 2002 by the Orange County Register (the LA Times of Orange County, CA) for my role in "Nine" this summer.  That was kinda neat.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  Hello!  Well, the new CD should be out by Spring.  The reason it keeps getting delayed has to do with a possible label-deal, so we really appreciate everybody's patience!  =)  As for me personally, I'm still singing and acting as my full-time job, mainly in musicals and such.  I spent all of December as a professional Christmas caroler...in the whole Dickensian get-up and everything.  It was fun.  I even sang at Charlton Heston's house on Christmas Eve.  Talk about Old Hollywood...sheesh!  How are you?<br><br>
