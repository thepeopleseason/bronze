P.S.  Sure, you can do a Tracey Says...

Yes,I do get to hang out on set while an episode is filming, as I did a bunch with Beer Bad.  As long as there isn't thinking or writing to be done.  I pull up a chair and get a pair of headphones so I can hear the dialogue clearly.  I usually wear my frilly pink blouse and a man named Gunter brings me fruit.  ; )</SMALL>

Thanks you guys.  Yes, there will be more from me later in the season.  LOVED that a Molson Canadian commercial aired in Canada.  That's where I'm from.
