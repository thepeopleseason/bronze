<dd>Xanderella -- Yes.  Take note of the striking use of semi-colons in Act Three...<br><br>Marlowe -- Whatver the HB on the TP wants.<br><br>Suz -- Well, it still might be the health inspector...  You know... And NOT Doyle, like I... joked... YES, joked about earlier...  <br><br>Yes, that Big Bad could be anything.<br><br><br><br>But not Doyle.<br><br>

<dd>Mar --<br><br>1.  Are you kidding?  Chocolate AND Caramel!  Russell Stovers makes the best kind, they have marshmallow as well.<br><br>2.  I honestly don't know.  My wife keeps switching them on me.  Something about hygiene.  I think... green?<br><br>3.  I'd have to watch the episode again, but if someone was in Drusilla's hands I'd guess dead.  Dru enjoys the mayhem so much she always breaks her toys.<br><br>Fury -- shouldn't you be writing?  ;-)<br><br>Hey, check me out!  I'm all blue in the glove<br><br>

<dd>tiggy -- Tim and Joss have mentioned they'd like me to write for Dung Beetle (I'm sorry, Fire Foot) sometime, but I'm way to busy running up and down the stairs between BUFFY and ANGEL.<br><br>Besides, Jose's too protective of his inner circle to let me come play.<br>;-)<br><br>

<dd>Looks like I posted before everyone could make their nudity requests.  Believe it or not, shirtless Wash goes hand in hand with shirtless Mal.  They're together in a room.  They're shirtless.  Actually, they have shirts, they just get ripped open.  How that happens, however, I'm not at liberty to discuss!<br><br>

<dd>[[And by the way, next time you sit down to write an ep, I have exactly two words for you: Shirtless. Mal.]]<br><br>Shirtless Mal is next week.  Seriously.  This week is shirtless Jayne.  Also seriously.<br><br>
