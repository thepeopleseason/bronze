<DD>Couple of things, then must run.  One:  The show will not change.  Yeah, I made a couple of trims in the final ep, but I was on board for that -- they just seemed tasteless (by pure coincidence).  But nothing will change in the creative process.  If someone tries to start interfering with the show, I'll not make it anymore.  Very simple.<BR>
<BR>
And, no, I haven't seen the Phantom Menace yet.  I will when I get a mo, but I don't have very high hopes.  Maybe the world needs a NEW epic Sci-Fi franchise. Hmm.....

<DD>It's nice to see how much people care about seeing the ep -- although there were threats made against WB execs, which is, uh, most creepy.  Look to poor Britain, who gets it in clumps, out of order, on different networks or not at all.  All we have to do is wait a couple of months.  Besides, now they're the FORBIDDEN EPISODES, and isn't that a treat in itself.  And to be slightly SPOILERISH, all this fuss over the graduation scene means the scene at the end of act one just slipped right by 'em.  La la la...

<DD>Don't have a lot of time -- unbelievable amounts of work to be done (no, I never stop complaining.  It's, like, my thing.)  Stories to break for Buffy and Angel, it's very exciting but Greenwalt and I have also come to the informed and reasonable opinion that IT CAN'T BE DONE.  We are panicking and proud of it.<BR>
<BR>
Had my usual tuesday night viewing -- only it was packed this week, since I did show the final ep and it was the only place outside of canada that was.  Fun.

<DD>Guys.  How bout that season finale, eh?  Rip snortin'!  Although, looking at it objectively, it WAS a little bit like band candy.  Still.  Pretty damn exciting.<BR>
<BR>
Controversy.  Not my fave.  For the record, I don't think the WB had to pre-empt the ep, but I understand why they did.  When those of you who haven't seen it do, you'll wonder what all the fuss was about.  But one violent graduation incident and the WB and I would feel like collective @$#%.  So.  July.  Hey, at least we won't be up against the final Home Improvement.<BR>
<BR>
Crazy people with guns bother me.  They just do.
