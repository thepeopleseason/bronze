<DD>OK, just one more to answer <b>WillowofOz</b>...<BR>
<BR>
Vote for Velvet Chain to play at the Lilith Fiar show in Chicago!  It's an online contest, and we've entered the song, "Treason." It's on the site in mp3 format, and it's free.  Woo-hoo!  Vote here:  <a target='_blank' href="http://sharehouse.xoom.com/lilith.php3?SH_PAGE=10">http://sharehouse.xoom.com/lilith.php3?SH_PAGE=10</a>  If you don't see "Treason.mp3" there (at the very bottom of the page), then check page 11.  (We may have moved...)<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

<DD>Goodnight, everybody!  Thanks so much for voting, and please spread the word to your friends...especially the ones who collect mp3s and the like!  =)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Polgarita:</b>  Thanks...you rock.<BR>
<b>Flowermouse:</b>  Hmmmmmm...you're a sneaky one, aren't you?  ;-)  Does that mean you'll vote for us?<BR>
<b>PeaceFire:</b>  You're too sweet.  It's embarrassing in only the coolest and most flattering of ways.  =)  I'm sure everything will be cool on the site, and if for some weird reason I have a suggestion, I'll e-mail you, OK?<BR>
<BR>
Buh-bye!<BR>

<DD>I've had rather a long day, so I'm going to wrap this up... (2nd to last post)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Avarice:</b>  Thank you, and MAN, I hope we get to play.  It'll only be at the one show in Chicago, but it would still ROCK.<BR>
<b>thy Slayer:</b>  I probably did...was I supposed to respond??  I'm sorry, I'm so swamped.  What was it about?<BR>
<b>Ms. Pointy:</b>  Yes, I remember you!  The answer would be mine.  My band.  hehe<BR>
<b>Mishale:</b>  Thank you so much, and yeah, I agree.

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Good evening.  Thank you!  I'm good.  More PT tomorrow, but they're fixing me up.  =)<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Hi, there!  Yes, well I hope you're right...<BR>
<b>gazoo:</b>  You're welcome.  =)<BR>
<b>banana:</b>  Hmmmmmmm...I think we did.  I seem to remember running across your name.  What was your feedback?  (We are having SUCH backlogged-data-entry-ohmygod-our-mailing-list-is-HUGE issues, so we're not as good about returning e-mails right now.  Sorry!)<BR>
<b>Roxanne:</b>  Cool!  It's a great venue.<BR>
<b>PeaceFire:</b>Oh, gosh, am I gonna blush?  You didn't embarrass me, I hope!  hehehe  Thanks a million; I'll check it out as soon as I get a chance.  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Sir Angelalex242</b>  Hi, there.  Thanks so much for voting, and it's going rather well!  But we need to maintain momentum all the way through August 1st.  Eek.  We have 200 votes right now.  =)  Last I checked, we were tied for first place.<BR>
<b>Adina:</b>  Well, I'm not <i>condoning</i> this, but you can get around the one-vote rule if you have multiple e-mail acct's and create new identities at XOOM.com with them.  (Use new names, as well.  Like your sister's, aunt's, 3rd-cousin-twiced-removed's....)  Glad you like the song!
