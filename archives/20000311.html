<DD>Gotta go, Kai's home.  <BR>
Just to add:  The comic book, <BR>
entitled FRAY, won't be out for <BR>
several months.  I have comleted <BR>
the first issue's script but the <BR>
artist has yet to start.  It will <BR>
be published by Darkhorse.  An <BR>
eight issue limited series.  It <BR>
was supposed to be shorter but as <BR>
I'm sure you all know, my mouth <BR>
runneth over.  I'll post more <BR>
sometime soon.  now someone has <BR>
indicated that I am DRUNK, of all <BR>
things, and that has given me a <BR>
really neat idea....<BR>
<BR>
Tara is a weevil.<BR>

<DD>Rose.  Tortured, <BR>
forbidden love.  Do i know it?  <BR>
It's possible I may have invented <BR>
it.  Yes, the Buffy Angel romance <BR>
is bas<i></i>ed on something from my own <BR>
life.  A very similar situation, <BR>
except obviously I'm not a <BR>
vampire, and the girl was a <BR>
little taller, and her name was <BR>
Emily, and a year older than me, <BR>
and she didn't really like me, <BR>
and I just kind of hung around <BR>
outside her bedroom once or <BR>
twice, not peeking or anything, <BR>
but you know, and the one time I <BR>
talked to her she was eating <BR>
hamburger and she choke on this <BR>
piece of gristle and coughed in <BR>
my face, her friends were all <BR>
laughing but I kept the gristle <BR>
in my memories book, at first it <BR>
kinda smelled but then it got <BR>
hard so that wasn't so bad, I <BR>
don't think Emily really knew my <BR>
name exactly, but our love was <BR>
forbidden, i'm pretty sure i <BR>
remember that.  So, yeah, i AM <BR>
Angel.  But in a Snyder kind of <BR>
way.<BR>
<BR>
Julia, BREATHE.<BR>
<BR>
Tara is not evil.

<DD>Sarah as Faith.  i <BR>
didn't get a chance to see the <BR>
public's reaction.  The girls <BR>
watched vid of each other <BR>
extensively, trying to ape each <BR>
other's movements without falling <BR>
into parody.  Tough row to hoe.  <BR>
I thought the ep plays very well <BR>
-- there's stuff I wish I could <BR>
have spent more time on, but that <BR>
was the peak of crunch time and <BR>
we were all exhausted and sick.  <BR>
I love the scene in the bedroom <BR>
after Faith and riley make the <BR>
beast -- i wish I could have <BR>
gotten more craziness like that <BR>
in there.  find the scary edge.  <BR>
Mello -- what exactly makes you <BR>
think your comments got me on the <BR>
board? Curious.  Yes, veruka is <BR>
dead, though I ran into Paige <BR>
(the actress) the other day and <BR>
had sadness, cuz she was good.  <BR>
Yes, Oz is coming back.  Yes, <BR>
Anya is going to have non-horny <BR>
funny.  Actually, she rules in <BR>
ep17.  I no you kid.<BR>

<DD>Some answers:<BR>
<BR>
1. we've never done a MAKING OF, <BR>
but I'm not against it.  We just <BR>
have so much NO TIME WHATSOEVER <BR>
is the catch.<BR>
<BR>
2. Nosferatu was cool.  thanks.<BR>
<BR>
3. How much I weight is my OWN <BR>
DAMN BUSINESS!  My god!  Have you <BR>
people no BOUNDRIES?<BR>
<BR>
4. I don't think we've singled <BR>
out Ohio purposefully.  Must just <BR>
be a fascinating place.<BR>
<BR>
5.  A crossover with charmed?  <BR>
Doesn't them doing the same plot <BR>
as us the week after count?  <BR>
<BR>
6.  No, I'm not usually that <BR>
obviously catty.<BR>
<BR>
7.  Olivia isn't evil.  But TARA <BR>
IS.<BR>
<BR>
8.  168 lbs, give or take.<BR>

<DD>Yes, Xander and Anya <BR>
will ALSO have more to do.  <BR>
Bottom line, i have too many <BR>
talented actors.  I should start <BR>
killing a few.  (Characters, not <BR>
actors.)  (Although, some <BR>
days....)  (No, I love 'em.  I <BR>
do.)  (Although, some days....)  <BR>
Spent a grueling day breaking <BR>
story with the crew.  We're <BR>
pretty raggedy by now, but one <BR>
more story to break - the last <BR>
one.  Mine.  The episode that <BR>
will forever be remembered as <BR>
that one that was on that time.<BR>

weird.<BR>

<DD>Yes, spike will have <BR>
more to do soon.  And when I say <BR>
MORE, I mean... well, I mean <BR>
more.  Probably why I said it.<BR>

<DD>Thoin, I like her too <BR>
-- and Carlos, of course, who <BR>
played the fiancee.  Perhaps they <BR>
could return.  And Lurking girl, <BR>
Olivia IS a brit.  sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Aol 4.0 means the end of this <BR>
will be cut off no matter what

<DD>I look ahead and I see <BR>
a desert.  A long, arid stretch <BR>
of re-runs that may well claim <BR>
the lives of many of my followers <BR>
before it is crossed.  But <BR>
DESPAIR NOT!  For there shall be <BR>
unto you many episodes of JAG, <BR>
and also VIP, and unto you as <BR>
well the show, the one with the <BR>
cop, he's troubled, you know the <BR>
one.  It's all good
