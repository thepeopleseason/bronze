<dd>andyourlittledogtoo:  I'm hoping to pop by the Succubus Club after my Halloween ep, time permitting.  Fury did see the Producers.  I think he liked it.<br><br>Christopher Marlow:  Excellent call!  <br><br>selwyn29: Wow.  A literary scientist?  Please tell me you know kung fu (or at least play the guitar).<br><br>LeoJan23: No comment.  And what the heck were you doing on the set?  Security!<br><br><br><br>Whup!  I'm getting yanked!  Peace, love, hugs and pokes!  I'll drop by next week.<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Princess of Darkness:  Hey!  It's so good to have you back!  Yes, I got your email.  I tried to send one back to you, but it kept being returned to me.  Sorry to hear about your accident.  Hope you're all right.  And hey -- I haven't forgotten about your interview.  I've actually started working on it now.  Hopefully I'll have it for you in the next couple of weeks.<br><br>tiggy:  Uh... flaunt what in Fury's face?  Careful, woman!  This is a family board!  Last bit of furniture arrives in two weeks. Once I have everything, I'll start smashing it in a blind drunken rage.  Arhhh!  Steve smash!<br><br>wajoma:  Why, you dirty little scamp!  How dare you?!  Oh, wait -- hold the FIRE hose.  Never mind.<br><br><br>UHP!  New board.  Sorry if I missed anybody.<br><br>

<dd>wajoma:  Good luck to your friend.  You should send me a copy of the CD too.  I don't have much to do with the music here, but I'd love to hear it.<br><br>Sarah's Carl:  Such is my power.<br><br>Ergoshakes:  You're just what I needed.  Mine eyes dazzle.  (Quick quiz for you literary types.  What play is that line from?  "Cover her face.  Mine eyes dazzle."  I might be paraphrasing -- it's been awhile.)<br><br>Wendy:  No huge bash -- that's a work night.  Some of us will gather to watch, then scamper home before we're discovered.<br><br>genrefan:  I share your tingle.  They're just finishing my Halloween ep.  <br><br>AngelBaby:  How do we keep the Buffyverse straight?  Well, truth be told, we're all a bunch Buffy geeks.  We've seen all the shows and remember most of it (Drew in particular has a disturbing recall of all things Buffy).<br><br>Falco:  See the above.  As for kissing James for you, absolutely not.  He's mine!  All mine!<br><br>selwyn29:  You wouldn't be a British scientist/martial artist would you?  ;) The animated Buffy is almost as difficult to write as the live action show.  The script is about 10 pages shorter (40 instead of 50), but we want them to be just as good as the live action stuff, so we put a lot of pressure on ourselves.  Hopefully it'll show up on the screen.<br><br>Allyson:  Fury's fine, as usual.  Doing some great work this year.  You're all gonna love it.<br><br>

<dd>Dirty Socks:  Thanks.  I was sorry to see that bit go, too.  On the other hand, I got to keep a lot of cool stuff too, so I guess it all balanced out.<br><br>Wendy:  Who wrote ep. 5?  Elves, my dear.  Dirty rotten stinking elves.  Those are the best kind!<br><br>The Mayoress:  Nope, no bible.  We just keep all that cool stuff in our tiny little coconuts.  Demon's are created by Joss and the gang.  Usually, we'll say:  Hey, we need something that can do THNIG-A-MA-BOB!  How about a THING-A-MA-BOB DEMON?<br><br>Tiggy!!!:  Yeah, I suck.  I so owe you a massive e.  Been super busy on the animated side of Buffy.  But I still wuv you, baby.<br><br>Cashmere:  We're breaking ep. 11 right now.  Spike dancing naked in the rain.  It's whole big thing.  No, wait -- that's me.  I'm always getting us confused.  (Stop that laughing, you!)<br><br>

<dd>Allyson:  Why, yes!  I just received a little something special in the mail.  Thanks so much.  Now I can finally get my sweet funky groove on.<br><br>sarahscarl:  Not sure about the signed script part, but yes, Sarah spearheaded the charity drive.  Thanks to her and the rest of the cast and crew, nearly 60,000 was raised.<br><br>AngelBaby:  Tasty tidbits?  Mmm!  This bagel sure fits the bill.<br><br>The Mayoress:  You're not half as excited as I am.  I'm talking to the Mayoress!<br><br>

<dd>Ah ha!  It's an early drop by!  I like to keep you guys guessing.  Actually, I'm going to get yanked into a meeting that may last all day, so I thought I'd better get in early.<br><br>You got me for probably about an hour.  Start talking, baby!<br><br>
