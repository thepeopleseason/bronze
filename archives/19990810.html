CHRIS - hi, eh.<BR>
<BR>
Stone Cold - The season starts the last week in Sept?  First week in Oct?  Anyone?<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - I'm hoping to bring Rob in gradually over a period of time.  I'd say by midway through the season he should be pretty much on his own but we'll have to play it by ear and make sure everybody's happy with everybody's work.<BR>
<BR>
Lisl Fox - thanks for asking, see below :)<BR>
<BR>
Hello - XTC is a british band (and I use that term loosely, it's basically two guys).  They make arty pop music (like a modern version of late-era Beatles).  They rock.<BR>
<BR>
Manx - a shihtzu.  (A very cute one)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bye everyone

<BR>
The English Slayer - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Hello - hi.<BR>
<BR>
Joshua - thanks, I appreciate it, particularly from a musician.<BR>
<BR>
Fax1 - Snuffy is great.  I particularly like his "Felicity" scores (though I swear I hate that show so I wouldn't know...)  His first big TV show was thirtysomething.<BR>
<BR>
Trinity - no worries.  Care to post those Star Trek lyrics?  Anyone?

Cosmic Bob - yeah I heard about the BWP ST - supposedly a copy of a mix tape of songs Heather brought along for the trip?  Oh well, more power to them if it sells a bunch of copies.  (Although I will most likely not partake).  and re: Pebbles, duly noted.<BR>
<BR>
Fax1 - Okey dokey.  Three points if I can guess what your e is about.<BR>
<BR>
ripley - whew, that was a close one.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Lisl Fox.<BR>
<BR>
chi - that's an interesting story.  I did hear once that when an instrumental version of a song plays, the lyricist still gets half the royalties, even though no words may have necessarily been sung.  Interesting... and very shrewd of Gene.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - I love my gadgets too.  Where did you see the show?  Do you remember who was featured?<BR>
<BR>
Hi Labrynth.<BR>
<BR>
slayUslayMe (by Lionel Ritchie, right?) - that was fake.  fooled ya<BR>
<BR>
CB- the XTC album, IMO is excellent.  And no worries I hired a flunkie last month.  (A Russian one no less)</SMALL>

Nancy E - That's exatcly what a shootstorm is.  Elementary meteorology right?<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx - there *will* probably be a commercially released Buffy score album, but not until well after the song album is released, and who knows when that'll be.<BR>
<BR>
VT - tell BoB to be gentle with me, I bruise easily<BR>
<BR>
SpookyMagoo - I'm actually back in LA now, so Joey is right here on my lap saying "arf arf"<BR>
<BR>
Angelus, justLURKing - hi<BR>
<BR>
princess daria - The fear was somewhat tempered by candy bars (which always works for me)<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - rested, recreated, and vacated, thank you.  I feel like I'm staring at a firing squad enjoying my last meal...<BR>
<BR>
tallgirl- hi and actually yes but not yet (see below)</SMALL>

David Fan - I've been pretty much out of the loop.  But I'll guess here that they're shooting ep 3 of Angel and ep 2 of Buffy - give or take.  I start on music for Angel ep 1 a week from tomorrow.  Buffy a week after that.  Then it gets fuzzy with caffeine and lack of sleep.<BR>
<BR>
As for my influences, well I don't listen to a lot of soundtracks, but I think I can hear a pretty strong Jerry Goldsmith and Danny Elfman influence in my Buffy stuff.  For fun I listen to all kinds of stuff like most people.  (Currently still digging the new XTC album among others)<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob - The peanut butter flavor detracts from the pure cap'n crunchness of the original.  Haven't we been through this already?  :)<BR>
<BR>
longtimelurker - vacation was had (trip to Europe) and enjoyed.  To answer your question - music is the very last thing that gets put in, after the show has been edited.<BR>
<BR>

VT - For shame indeed, I don't want to hurt BoB's feelings.  How often does he post?<BR>
<BR>
Hi Meeb, vacation is, well, going (soon to be gone).  The Angel theme is still in progress.  I still can't say for sure whether what (or whose) it'll end up being.<BR>
<BR>
Mabb - yes, I'll be doing both series, at least at first.  At some point I'll be bringing on another composer to help me out and eventually take over the show outright (if it all works out).
