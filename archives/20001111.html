<DD>ED1_faith: good luck and remeber, Cure is really easy to play...but really hard to sing and play!<BR>
<BR>
Blueronin: Thanks! Actually, my "date" is with a threesome of beauties...Guinness, the new U2 record, and my guitar!<BR>
<BR>
X-lander: We shall keep you informed!<BR>
<BR>
TickleBunny Morel: No one, even Cami, could recover from spanking Kenix!<BR>
<BR>
Always a newbie: I'm a pseudo-VIP...just appeared in the Bronze in one ep of Buffy and did the Angel theme. The real VIP's are the writers, actors and producers.<BR>

<BR>
Mesuvius: That or we've gotta play out of LA!<BR>
<BR>
AngelStarr: I'd love to come down to my old stomping grounds (the South that is, as I'm from KY) to play. Good to meet ya!<BR>

<DD>X-lander: We're working hard on new material but, alas, we cannot release the theme as we don't own it. Fox will release it when it feels the time is right, I guess.<BR>
<BR>
Blueronin: That's about the last time I had regular access to a computer (hoping to get one of my own in Jan. 2001...just not one named HAL). All's well here in LA and looking bright.<BR>
<BR>
ED1_faith: As far as I know, the Nov. 17th DV, FSM, VC show will not be webcast...but I could be wrong.<BR>

<DD>ED1: Thanks for the kind words! I'm swell...just getting good and liquored up before my big date tonight...*g* Hint: everything in the verse and pre-chorus happens up and down the neck on the "d" and "g" strings with the "b" and "e" strings open and ringing...
