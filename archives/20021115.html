<dd>Hello, everyone --<br><br>I'm one of the new guys at Camp Mutant Enemy -- I'm the writer of tonight's Firefly episode -- and Kiba and Artie were kind enough to invite me to post over here.  So here I am!  How YOU doin'?<br><br>As someone who's been a huge fan of Buffy and Angel for years, it's awesome to be a part of this gang and to get to talk to the fans as an "insider."  So, let me see... what can I tell you...<br><br>Tonight on Firefly, we land on a distant planet where Spike has been marooned for four hundred years, all the while breeding deadly earwigs and feeding on moist dirt.  He sneaks on board Serenity and wackiness ensues.  Okay, I'm lying.  It's actually Angel.<br><br>Here's what really happens:  (SPOILER WARNING)<br><br>The crew travels to a central planet unlike any we've seen before on the show -- it's shiny and clean and high tech -- and Simon hires the crew to pull a heist.  Yep, the good doctor has a criminal streak in him, and the heist involves stealing a fortune in medical supplies from an Alliance hospital.  Betcha the doctors on ER would never posse up to steal drugs!<br><br>So they have a plan masterminded by Simon, and everything goes smoothly until... well, now I gotta stop.  Suffice it to say that some pretty unexpected things happen and some seriously bad dudes show up to make life difficult for the crew.  You'll get to see some cool sci-fi toys you haven't seen on Firefly before, and you'll get some surprising character developments.  <br><br>I'd tell you more, but I've already given away too much.  Check it out and post away with your thoughts -- I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>Thanks for letting me play in your sandbox,<br>Jose<br><br>
