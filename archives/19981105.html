<DD>Kyle: first, the camera weighs alot more and is mounted and balanced... and it does shake as well when moved, just have to make smooth dolly moves and it's alot of technical machinery... that costs just a wee bit more than a video camera.  but i think they now make Video camera's that  are more like steadicams, that don't flow smoother when repositioned or moving.  b). lot's of great set dressing and a kick a$$ DP and lighting crew.<BR>
