<dd>Invincor--GHOSTS OF ALBION is being animated by Cosgrove Hall, a wonderful and well known English firm.  Some of the people involved in the deal worked on those Dr. Who projects, but the animation in this is MUCH better.<br><br>Beldin--It's the current DR. FATE, Hector Hall, who's a member of the current JSA.<br><br>

<dd>slayerdaddy . . . Andrew as Dr. Fate . . ROTFLMAO  I love Andrew.<br><br>beldin, yep.  Having a blast, too.  I feel very fortunate to be able to really do something with the character.<br><br>Thoin, it's MEANT to be watched on the net.  If your dialup is too slow, well, here's hoping it'll be available in other formats eventually.<br><br>

<dd>Ojagwers . . . :)  Kinda figured.  Hope you're enjoying it.<br><br>Thoin . . . whew.  That's a relief.  There's actually a reason for the Jane Austen reference having to do with the origin of the deal with the BBC, but though the name's been dropped a few times, it's actually got NOTHING to do with nor is it anything like Jane Austen.  As for comparisons to Buffy . . . it's no more like Buffy than DOCTOR FATE, a sixty year old comic book character I'm currently writing for DC.<br><br>Finally, as to whether you'll be able to see it here . . . well, the internet is pretty much world wide.  *grin*  So . . . sure.<br><br>

<dd>Ourobourus, heya.  :)<br><br>Thoin . . . ummm, I'm all nervous now.  What if he was describing it perfectly?<br><br>We like it. :)<br><br>In a nutshell, it concerns William and Tamara Swift, a brother and sister in 1830s London whose grandfather is the magical protector of England.  When he dies, they inherit both his power and responsibility . . . reluctantly.  Particularly because there are loads of demons their grandfather has pissed off over the years.  Fallen angels.  Archdukes of Hell.  Fortunately, they do have some assistance, in the form of the GHOSTS OF ALBION, the spirits of the dead, some of whom are of very recognizable figures from British history.<br><br>

<dd>I'm with you, Mrs. B.<br><br>O.O., it's called GHOSTS OF ALBION.  It's an online animated hour long supernatural period drama, broken down into five segments.  It's going to be uploaded onto bbc.co.uk/cult/ weekly starting March 27th.  Written by Amber and little old me, directed by Ms. Benson, with a cast including Anthony Daniels and Emma Samms.  Fantastic cast, btw.  We're VERY excited.<br><br>As for eppies based on the books. . . I can't choose.<br><br>

<dd>slayerdaddy . . . not my department, I'm afraid.  meanwhile, though, anyone in the mood for something new can check out the project Amber and I are doing with the BBC.<br><br>sunlit5, thanks for the beads. :)<br><br>Algerina, not down.  Just don't like working late.  :)<br><br>Cassie, nice to meet you too! Sounds like you guys are having quite the party.<br><br>And . . . what band?<br><br>

<dd>OMF, thanks. :)<br><br>Old One, I'm good.  Just working tonight and we're Buffy-less.<br><br>Nikka, but if we dance I can admire your belly-dancing from us close.  ;)  Any of the UK folks who've seen me at a London con will tell you I love to dance . . . even though I look like a drunken rhino while doing so.  :)<br><br>

<dd>XanFan, absolutely.<br><br>Nikka, why thanks. :) I'm a great lover of all things Mardi Gras.  I don't have to flash anything for the beads, do I?  And are we having gumbo?<br><br>Wolfguard, my understanding is that the show's ending will have no immediate effect on the publishing program.<br><br>
