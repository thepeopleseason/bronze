<dd><b>Lilyana:</b>  Glad to hear you're feeling better!<br><b>Y_slaybelle:</b>  Actually, all our CD's are available on our very own website, very cheaply.  =)  We're staying indie for the time being.  We rather like it.  Just go to <A href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank">www.velvetchain.com</a> and order stuff! (If you want to, of course...)<br><b>Shpadoinkle:</b>  OK, first of all, LOVE your name!  Secondly, yep, a total smartie hottie!  lol  But really, he was flirting with me the whole game, which was just an odd experience...he didn't seem to like me as much once I <i>WON</i>, though!  hehehehe....MWAHhahahaha!  *ahem*  Please excuse the outbust....<br><b>Zeus:</b>  Oh, OK....That explains it!  hehe<br><br>

<dd><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Ah!  An interesting question!  I actually never really studied voice in any major way.  I started singing at about 5 years old (that was my fist solo at school, anyway), and I was in every choir, madrigal group, musical, and a capella doo-wop kinda deal I could find.  I listened to a ton of Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, and Etta James growing up. And I <i>loved</i> Annie Lennox's voice and David Bowie's, too. I sang all throughout college, and even managed to get into an Opera Master Class with no formal training.  (I faked my way through the whole thing...but I knoe two honest-to-goodness arias now!) I finally took 6 months of voice lessons (one 45 minute lesson, once a week) when I moved to Los Angeles, which was very useful in that my teacher was finally able to really show me how to support my voice so that I didn't lose it - which I used to do sometimes back then.  Since then, it's all been experience - both onstage and in the studio.  I learn something new about my voice and how to use it every day.  I really sing by instinct.  (Enough info for ya?  Bet you're sorry you asked!  hehehe)<br><b>Adri:</b>  You're very welcome...thanks for having me!  =)<br><b>Mally B:</b>  Sounds like fun!<br><b>Aurora:</b>  Why, thank you!  *blush*<br><br>

<dd>Hey, <b>ZEUS!</b>  How ya doin'??  Love your "from love to brooding" thing.  ;-)  And what's this about Trance having horns??  I just saw the episode with her and the Cigarette Smoking Man from X-Files, and I didn't notice no stinkin' horns!!??<br><b>AussieBullDog:</b>  No worries about not haing a question!  It's lovely to talk to you...is it Saturday there?<br><b>willowjadia:</b>  Hello!  I hope so!  We're really going to try and tour again.<br>Hi back to <b>KatBeck</b>...<br><b>Thoin:</b>  Cool!  You like "I Don't Care" eh?  That's a very interesting, odd little tune.  And I missed you guys, too!<br><br>

<dd><b>Y_slaybelle:</b>  Oh, wow...that would be so cool!  But alas, no.  We're still trying to get another US tour off the ground!  =)<br><b>Mally B:</b> Happy New Year to you, too!  Mine was quite nice.  I was singing.  (A non-Velvet Chain side gig I did for the Holidays.) How was yours?<br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Well, you just <i>rock!</i>  =)  As for the PBP, I would love to attend, but haven't heard anything from anyone yet.  If I get invited, I'll go, though!  ;-)<br><b>Lilyana:</b>  Sorry to hear you got sympathy-laryngitis!  I was out of it for a while.  Then I sang on swollen shords for over amonth, which was not the best thing.  So, my voice is just now starting to come back.  (My last gig was New Year's Eve...)  I should be all better in a few more days.  How are you?<br><br>

<dd>Good evening, guys...  I just wanted to stop by and say hi.  I've been so busy, and then our computer was down for almost a MONTH (which was a nightmare), so I haven't been around much lately.  How's everybody doing?<br><br>
