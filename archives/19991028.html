<DD>  Hi.  Just a  note to answer questions some of you had about "Fear, Itself":<BR>
<BR>
Buffy's fear was of abandonment - that those she cares about will leave her eventually.  (As I already posted, the TV Guide description of her "facing those she couldn't save" was just plain wrong.)  The zombies were incidental manifestations when she was feeling vulnerable and unnerved.  <BR>
<BR>
A partial inspiration for the dynamic of the ep. was the Blair Witch Project which we'd all seen a few months before it opened.  The thing we found most unsettling in the movie (and Joss found particularly scary)  was how the characters began to turn on each other, instead of uniting to get out of the woods.<BR>
<BR>
The fear demon, Gachnar, provoked the rift between Buffy and Willow.  (This doesn't discount Willow's underlying concern that she's the "sidekick," the one who always needs rescuing.  It's an extension of her maturing as a wicca, that she wants to come into her own in the evil-fighting arena.)<BR>
<BR>
Willow's fear was of not being able to control these  new powers of hers.<BR>
<BR>
Oz's fear: Wolfing out someday and hurting (or killing) the woman he loves.  [Think most of you got that one.]<BR>
<BR>
Xander's was his fear of becoming meaningless (invisible) to his friends who now live a life apart from him.<BR>
<BR>
Why Giles and Anya's fears weren't addressed was that they weren't in the house long enough for anything to manifest itself.<BR>
<BR>
There were other interesting questions out there, but I'll try to get to them some other time.  Don't forget to remind me.

A personal note to Polgara - <BR>
<BR>
On behalf of myself and the other writers, sorry we didn't get the chance to meet you and the other contest winners at the Halloween Bash.  <BR>
<BR>
There was a definite flaw in the planning of the event that kept us, as well as Joss and the actors apart from the fans.  <BR>
<BR>
However, we were happy you were there and hope you had fun.
