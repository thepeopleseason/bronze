<DD><aqau1295>One quick point of clarification --<BR>
<BR>
The posts that were bugging me had nothing to do with me.  So, Creep Crawley and TheName, I have no problem with you or anyone not liking an ep with my name on it.  <BR>
<BR>
Just wanted that to be clear before anyone thinks I have a thin skin or anything.<BR>
<BR>
That is all.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Really gone now.

<DD><aqau1295>Caspian - Oh, wait.  Forget I said anything.  I was confused.  And stupid.  You didn't hear anything like that from me.  Got it?  And that goes for the rest of you.<BR>
<BR>
genrefan - Well, I'm doing my part by not working at the moment.

<BR>
Or Duke.  (I'm no help to you.)<BR>
<BR>
I will give Becca big kudos from those who loved last night's ep.<BR>

But, I will not hug David Greenwalt.  Again.  (He's got roaming hands.)

<DD><aqau1295>Creep - Enlighten me.<BR>
<BR>
Caspian - He's always been a mortal.  His whole life.  Glory's "punishment" was to live out a mortal life and die.  But she managed to surface from Ben's subconscious and take over.
