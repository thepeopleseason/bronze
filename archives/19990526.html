<DD>I am SOOO not here, but I was scrolling...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Mysty Mage:</b>  LOL!!!  Shows you how frazzled I've been lately.  Can't even remember what songs are on my own CDs anymore.  D'oh!  Thanks for setting that straight.  So, there are only 3 songs from Groovy Side that haven't been re-released.  =)<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

<DD>ACK!  I've got tons to do before I run off to rehearsal, so I'm outta here...I'll try to answer all questions really quickly...<BR>
<BR>
1. The contest ends on Aug. 1, 1999  But vote NOW.  hehe<BR>
2. The logo is a blend of an oroginal caricacture of me as drawn by a cartoonist named Chris Hertrich and design elements provided by Jeff Stacy.<BR>
3. Groovy Side will probably not be re-released, but So far the only songs remaining on that CD that have not been released on some other album are "Time and Days" "All Your Cash" "Groovy Side" and "Sun Setting Sun."  "SSS" and "All Your Cash" will most likely be rerecorded for a future album.<BR>
4. Our CD's are not readily availbale at traditional retailers, but you can order them from us for CHEAP, and we fill orders quickly.  We use a secure server and accept all major credit cards, or you can sned in a check or money order.  What could be easier??  ;-)<BR>
5.  The jaw's getting better, I received AjO's pic, and I haven't had time for SW yet, which makes me very sad.<BR>
<BR>
I have SO got to run!  Bye!  =)<BR>

<DD>Did the episode need toning down? I really can't say. There seems to be only one shot or sequence in question. I personally didn't think it needed anything, but it isn't my interpretation in question here. As I've said, if the conservative faction manages to bring pressure on the creative minds of Hollywood it might be a cencorship disaster. The WB's move was to protect US ALL from that kind of pressure.

<DD>Is that really you, Todd?  If so, I'd be happy to e- you the codes....Um, I assume your name is normally password protected, so that's how we all know it's you, right?  =)<BR>
<BR>
Thank you to <b>Kristen, Fuschia, Sachiel, and Samantha</b> for voting!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Peace Fire:</b>  Wey, THANK you!  =)  ANd yes, that is me in Frenchie, as well.  Actually, every vocal you hear is me.  (In Buffy, a friend of mine stacks some of the harmonies along with me for a "fuller" sound.)<BR>
<b>Slay_me:</b>  I'm good, thanks....I'll be better when you go vote!  hehe.  I'll let you know about the eps.  Thank you!

<DD><yellow411> Grinn: Not for you, I suppose, but it might be a little akward for a WB employee to bash his employers publicly on-line. I understand your disappointment - but if even one fool copied violence on Buffy in this current atmosphere of conservatism the pressure on the show might be crushing. Ony an opinion, not an agreement with their actions.

<DD><vyellow411> Good evening, Bronzers. I just popped in to say "hello". Earlier today I got a message that someone using a handle similar to my e-mail address was bashing the WB execs. Just wanted to set the record straight.
