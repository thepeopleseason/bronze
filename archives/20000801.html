<DD>Just snuck off to REDSUN's pretty site and now I'm off to bed.  I'll try to visit again, give you all the dirt on filming.  (Most of the dirt concerns my weight-gain and constant whining, but i may edit that out.)<BR>
<BR>
And thank god we changed the dialogue in Marti's wonderful first draft, 'cause originally it went:<BR>
<BR>
"You have to be with the one you love."<BR>
<BR>
"What are you, GAY?"<BR>
<BR>
Just wouldn't have had the same impact.  plus no toaster.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bye-ee!

<DD>Lee -- actually, I don't know those bands.  John King is our music guy and he chooses most of them (for both shows).  He smart.<BR>
<BR>
SocKs -- And it's all about ME!  Yay!           (Cool.)

<DD>Happy being BORN ALREADY to MIGUEL.  (Maxim, the magazine?  I don't actully read that.  I prefer the old fashioned literary magazines like STUFF.)<BR>
Antipodean -- sadly, I already have a pizza oven.  So no girly action.  DAMN THAT OVEN!

<DD>Well, I begin to hear the call of the wild fourposter.  Thanks again to Kristen and all and congrats to CharlieX and Li'lTree, way to make a person.

<DD>Kristen -- 'like' is not the word.  ('pudendous' is not the word either, but it's a damn fun one.)  NO ONE i know has an engraved toaster.  Plus, coolness aside, the fact that you cared that much about what we've been doing with Willow and Tara... sniff sniff, something in my eye... Can't wait also to show JANE, who wrote for Ellen back when.  Thank you.

<DD>And now, the inevitable lies and misdirections about next season.  (I mean spoilers.)<BR>
<BR>
1)The character of Xander will be a lesbian. (I'm gunning for a mix-master.)<BR>
<BR>
2)Everything Buffy says, though it will SOUND perfectly normal, will be misspelled.<BR>
<BR>
3)Because of counter programming by FOX, ANGEL will now be called LIGHT ANGEL.  Or possible PLAID ANGEL.  Or ANGEL WHO IS NEITHER DARK NOR TOUCHING ANYONE NOR IN ANY WAY A CITY THEREOF BUT JUST THE ONE ANGEL WHO'S LIGHT AND/OR PLAID.<BR>
<BR>
4)Buffy and Riley will finally have sex.<BR>
<BR>
5)Tara's extreme nakedness will be, sadly, covered by clothing.<BR>
<BR>
6)All monsters, perils and/or problems will be resolved through angry finger-pointing and prayer.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from that, everything pretty much staus quo -- same stuff you've seen before -- in fact, most of the eps will be clip shows or cleverly concealed reruns.  Yay.  Yay to the Buffy.

<DD>LESBIAN TOASTER<BR>
LOVE YOU THE MOST<BR>
ALTERNATIVE LIFEstyle CHOICE TOASTER<BR>
HOT GIRL-ON-GIRL TOAST<BR>
(DRUM SOLO)<BR>
LESBIAN TOASTER AH-WHOOOOO!<BR>
(TRIANGLE SOLO)<BR>
TOAST FOR YOU AND FOR ME....<BR>
<BR>
Got an Emmy nom, all very well but my beautiful engraved (ENGRAVED, for the love of God) toaster is far far cooler.  THANK YOU to all my toaster buddies.  The ringleaders will be identified and ruthlessly thanked.  Meanwhilst, toasty joy and sincere thinks.  Can't wait to show Aly   and Amber.  ALSO, it happens not only to be a beautiful design, but the exact same design as my toaster WHICH JUST BROKE DOWN.  That's fate.<BR>
<BR>
So thanks, and thanks, and thanks.  Bread shall be warm.<BR>
<BR>
(you know, I forgot th'damn color codes.)<BR>
<BR>
Jossage.
