Hi/bye Erika, bummer re: the Buffy ST, stay in TVT's face and they'll see the light I'm sure.<BR>
<BR>
To everyone else, are you really that surprised?  I'm as dissapointed as the next guy, but I can't say I would do any differently if I were TVT.  They've got one mandate: to sell as many CDs as possible.  Somebody somewhere decided what to put on the CD, in order to sell the most copies, regardless of its inherent Buffiness.  And that's what they came up with.<BR>
<BR>
I strongly urge whomever feels strongly about this issue to write TVT; they might listen if they become convinced that making the CD more reflective of the show would sell more CDs.  <BR>
<BR>
Also, FYI, "Praise" by Fatboy Slim makes a prominent appearance in the Prom ep.  Not that it changes anything drastically, but it might give you small comfort to add one more song to the (too-small) list of actual Buffy-related songs.<BR>
<BR>
Of course this is assuming that FSM's list is actually what will end up on the album.  There's a lot of time between now and June 20 for TVT to change their minds.<BR>
<BR>
As far as a score album goes, several of the smaller specialty labels have expressed interest, and I've been told Fox will authorize a score release approximately six months after the song CD comes out.  Here's hoping.  Meantime there's always the MP3's of score pieces from the second season over at the CBCC site.<BR>
<BR>
I went skating today.  Skating!<BR>
<BR>
Sorry I can't stick around.  Have a nice rest-of-the-week!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
BYE

<DD>Nu Phalanx:  Hey!  Well, the iMac is cool, but it won't work for what we wanted to use it for (majorly boring band-business...don't ask), so beleive it or not, I will be purchasing a PC this very evening.  (I can't believe it, myself.)  Oh!  And please go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.mp3.com">www.mp3.com</a> and download our songs!  It's free, and it would be cool if we could move up in the rankings over there.  (we just got on)<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer:  It is on Four Star Mary's website.  It's "preliminary info" they got from TVT records last week.

<DD>JeanieTTF:  Thanks!  Every letter will help!<BR>
<BR>
horizon:Very well put!  Thank you.  E-mail is good, too.  But actual snail-mail is (apparently) super-impressive.  (hmmmm...you sure Screw-you-you-bastards is the wrong approach?  lol)</SMALL>

<DD>Hehehe...yes, the wasp has been terminated.  Jeff happend to come in at just the right moment, and I made him kill it.  lol<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to all MP3 downloaders!  It's cool, it's fun, it's free, and YES, it will give us more exposure if we can manage to become on of the more downloaded bands on the site.  The industry actually notices things like that.<BR>
<BR>
Um, so now that I am concentrating a bit better, how is everybody?<BR>
<BR>
Oh,amd many thanks to Shadowslayer and AngelLover24/7 for their upcoming letters!  =)  ("I want my VC goodness!"  lol...sounds like the old "I Want My MTV" campaign...)</SMALL>

<DD>OK, I'm back.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks a lot for the "condolences," but you know what?  I still haven't given up.  The info we received was on FSM's website, not any official source, so you never know.  There might still be changes to come.  So, if you want to help me out one more time - to keep the dream alive, so to speak lol - write a letter!!!!  Send it to:<BR>

<BR>
OK?Of course, that's only if you actually <i>do</i> want us on the soundtrack.  Honestly, don't write if you're not into us or anything. =)</SMALL>

<DD>Hi, everyone.<BR>
<BR>
Please go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.mp3.com">www.mp3.com</a> and download our songs!  This is important, as it will raise our rank at the site.  Just looking at our page won't do anything, but downloading a tune will.  We have "Watching You" there, as well as "Strong" and "Frenchie," and they're all CD quality sound.  And FREE.  So, do a Diva a favor, and go download something, OK?  Thanks.<BR>
