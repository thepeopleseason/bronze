<DD>Stake: Love ya lots.<BR>
<BR>
Rikki: Sorry if I blew the surprise.  But at least I didn't tell you about Xander getting impaled by -- whoops!  I did it again!<BR>
<BR>
Geo:  Aww, I still love, ya man.  Gimme a hug.  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>Out the door, but I caught that Geo seems to be a bit upset.  Was it that spoiler thing?  Thought we could talk about episodes that have already aired in the US.  What's the dealio, man?<BR>
<BR>
PS:  The cat gets it, of course.

<DD>Last one, really.<BR>
<BR>
singsinthecar:  I may be terminally confused.  Last Friday someone posted a link to PBP photos and their friend Lucy (I think) was in most of them.  Have I gone completely nuts?  Bound to happen.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Janni: How was I able to write for a 15-year-old girl?  Nope, no sisters.  But I am in touch with my feminine side. ;-)<BR>
<BR>
Yahtzee:  Buffy and Giles felt that the gang deserved to know what they would be fighting -- and possibly dying -- to protect.  It was a serious act of friendship and trust, and one they all proved worthy of -- even Spike.  Tara's the perfect example.  Even faced with a brainsucking, she refused to give up Dawn as the Key.  Hey, speaking of which, did you guys catch that we set up the Tara brainsuck in "Blood Ties"?  Check out her reaction when she learns Glory's a brainsucker.  <BR>
<BR>
Holly:  And hello to you, too.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, of course I'll join anything with Kane, Hallet, or Chocolate in the title.<BR>
<BR>
Hugs and pokes to all.  Sorry I gotta jet so soon, but various duties call.  Look forward to hearing from you on the Succubus Club.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>kronos:  Who isn't insane for Kane?<BR>
<BR>
Lil Dawn:  Yes, sweet elf, you can write for me.  Now get to work!  My animated Buffy needs a good polish!<BR>
<BR>
Graecie:  Can't find Lipris in the dictionary, huh?  Okay, I'll take pity.  It's actually ancient Summarian for, "Hey, look at that!  His leg came right off in my hand!"  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You guys just never learn, do ya?<BR>
<BR>
singsinthecar: No, I didn't get the stuff you mailed me yet.  Hmmm... Maybe the Frog's fooling with me.  How's Lucy?<BR>
<BR>
Alison Rose: Thanks for the kind words.  Have to share much credit with Joss for handing me such a great storyline and to the amazing Michelle Trachtenberg for a stunning performance. As for Spiral, expect something verrrry different.<BR>
<BR>
Bling:  Yeah, I got vetoed for the opening of "Spiral".  My teaser would have sucked up the enitre budget for the show. Man, it was BIG!  (Still is pretty big, actually.)<BR>
<BR>
Know I'm missing a lot of you folks, but have run in just a second.

<DD>Cushy:  Slaves are always welcome. Get to work and fetch me a drink!<BR>
<BR>
Gerry: To answer your questions:  No, Yes, No.  Or was that: Yes, No, Yes?  No, No, Yes?  Ah!  So confuzled!  Cushy, where's that drink!<BR>
<BR>
DeAN: Nice to see my name in da big blue.  One thing though.  I never call myself "Steven" unless it's the full "Steven S. DeKnight".  Any chnace we can get that pesky "n" out of there?  (Oh!  The fame has gone straight to my big fat head!)<BR>
<BR>
Marlowe:  Send Cairo my best.  Still looking forward to posting with her one day.<BR>
<BR>
Mia:  Aw, shucks.  My head's swelling.  Would love to pop in during "Spiral," but I'm having a big viewing party that night.  I'll try to stop in the next morning, depending on the size of my hangover.<BR>
<BR>
Molly:  I was out seeing The Mummy Returns to Suck Again.  Okay, I know that's harsh, but I thought it was a lot of noise and twelve different plots with absolutely no soul.  Kept thinking it could have been a great movie -- If Joss or Doug Petrie had done it.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  Everybody gets a little something in Spiral (well, almost everybody).  Look for Amy the rat to really stand out.  As for the musical, if Joss says it, it must be true.  <BR>
<BR>
Tiggy3323:  Always a pleasure.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry if I missed anybody.  Scanning fast since I have to go soon.

<DD>Lil Dawn:  Being 16 can really suck.  But trust me, things get much better.  I spent most of my teen years a depressed disaster.  Now look at me. Woo-hoo!  No pants!  I mean, uh, no worries.  You know, except for Joss finding out that I really suck (elves actually write my scirpts -- shhh, don't tell anybody).<BR>
<BR>
Dirty Socks:  Yes, I will be joing Kitty and Candy on the Succubus Club this Wednesday at around 6 PM PST.  Call in, guys.  Love to hear from you.<BR>
<BR>
Cashmere:  Things seem to be going well at the Writers Guild.  I understand that we should receive the formal offer from the Companies soon.  As for the secret meaning of "Spiral", if you rearrange the letters, you get: Lipras.  That's all I'm saying.

<DD>Hola, and a fine Steve DeKnight Friday to everyone.  Unfortunately I won't be able to hang around for as long as usual today.  Many things to do before the big Spiral premier Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
How's my favorite posting board doing today?
