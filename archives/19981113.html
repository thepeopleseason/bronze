Angle Man:  I responded already.  You have to have comic book scripting samples, preferably published.  You have to contact the editor of the Buffy comics and submit them to him.  You have to ASK, and show that you can do it.  At the present time, I think they have more writers than they need, but that shouldn't stop you.  I'm not sure what other kind of answer you're looking for.

<DD>Mutant Enemy:  perhaps what you hadn't noticed is that much of my reference to comics and books and signings etc ARE Buffy related.  On the other hand, newcomers are very welcome here, and I was greatly amused by your spiderish antics.<BR>
<BR>
MystyMage:  Amy definitely has a cameo in book two, and it looks like she'll have one or two larger scenes in book three.  It also looks like several other supporting characters will appear in and out of the trilogy.

<DD>Labrynth:  Although Spike was once described as being "barely 200" and it was implied that he was sired by Angel, Joss has later assured everyone that Drusilla actually sired Spike.  Since Drusilla became a vamp in the late 19th century, Spike cannot be much older than 100, not including his age at the time of his death.

<DD>Avarice:  As soon as I have REAL news, not just hopeful news, I'll post it.  For instance, I'm doing a three issue ANGEL miniseries for Dark Horse for next summer.  Also a BUFFY #1/2 comic to be polybagged with Wizard magazine.<BR>
<BR>
ANGLE MAN:  I'm not sure how honestly I should answer that question.  We're not going to touch that, for one.  But as to the discrepancy . . . don't try to adjust for it.  Spike is not two hundred years old, despite what Giles says in School Hard.  He was indeed sired by Dru.

Sachiel, not to get all sappy on you, but my Dad passed away about eleven years ago, and I'd give away years of my life for one more meal with him.  Aside from him, however, let's see . . . I'd have to say (and what a weird combination) classic American author Jack London, and comedian Lou Costello.

<DD>Shadowslayer, I'm great, thanks.  Just came from a bitcin' book signing.  Some are really bad, some are like tonight.  So I'm pumped.<BR>
<BR>
Avarice:  just hanging with my kids this weekend, doin' the dad thang.  Oh, and Out of the Madhouse will be in stories the first week of January.  I should see copies in about a month.  It's already on Amazon, amazingly enough.<BR>
<BR>
And now that we're getting the 1999 schedule up and running, I should have some very cool news about new projects pretty soon.
