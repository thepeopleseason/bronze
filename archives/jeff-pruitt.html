Today, Jeff Pruitt, the stunt coordinator on the show, showed up on the
posting board and answered a few questions. I remembered to actually copy
the actual question this time. A point of reference - Sophia, who is
mentioned quite a bit, is the woman who is SMG's stunt double, and Jeff's
girlfriend. Enjoy!

    Hello Guys.
     Just got back and saw that Joss had posted last night in response to
something that was attributed to me regarding "who sired who" and all. I
figured I'd better post here and clear it up lset my boss get the wrong
impression.
     Everybody here knows that I never talk about upcoming plots or anything
regarding the characters - until it has aired. Mostly I just talk stunts and
fights and chit-chat. That's it.
     Sometime ago someone was debating the "who sired who" thing and they
asked me what I thought. I didn't run to Joss and ask him anything. SCHOOL
HARD had already aired. I agreed that Angel must have sired Spike because
Joss said so. I said that because Joss wrote SCHOOL HARD and in the script
Spike says: "You were my sire, man ... You were my g.d. Yoda." So
I simply said that it must be true. That's all.
     Now they say that Joss says that it is something else. I don't know
anything about that. I just do the stunts. I love the writing on the show
and I love the fact that I get to do the fights. If Joss decides one day
that Bela Lugosi
sired everyone then that's just fine with me. I only pray that Joss would
let me make Bela a Kung Fu genius.
     Okay?

Hey Jeff! How are you? I have school tommorow..I hate when vacation
ends....two-parter looks great!

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 19:58:18 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
Hi Gregg. Yeah. I was so happy to see the stunts in the promo.

jeff: nice to see you back here. when the weather changes and you guys can't
do a fight scene (or any scene) outside, do you have a contingency plan? if
yes, how do you guys reserve the space for the contingency plan, lets say,
if it's at the school library?

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:01:40 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
techzero: So far it's all worked out. The weather has been on our side. We
have not stopped once that I can remember due to weather. The regular sets
(such as the library) are always sitting there waiting for us - so that's no
prob. A few times I've worried that other "one episode" sets would not be
ready
- but they have always made it on time.

If you're still here, I'm sorry. That was me who assumed you had talked to
Joss. I guess I got confused.

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:05:33 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
kate: That's okay. I'll just talk to Joss' assistant tomorrow and make sure
he understands. I'm such an over-anxious type paranoid type anyhow. I'm
always worried that one day Joss will be mad at me - but he never is. At the
moment he is very happy with the stunt department and the way we have
recently been able to give him exactly what he wants for the show. So I
guess he'll let me live:)

===============================================

kate says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:04:05 PST 1998 dialup-tc3-10.minn.net)
Have you worked on Buffy as a stunt coordinator since the beginning? (I
thought I read someone else's name under Stunt coordinator when I was
watching a first season ep.)

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:09:10 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
kate: I started at the end of the first episode of the second season. Last
season they went through a few people before they got Sophia as the regular
stunt double. After Sophia went back this season I joined the show and it
has been the two of us ever since.

The stunts look great... who is leaping into the water as Angel... is that
you?Also, how many eps have you actually been a vamp in... since seeing you
in TED, I think I see you in EVERY old ep!!!

scottj says:

JEFF PRUITT: Hi, nice to see you back here again. Hope you enjoyed your
holidays. So is it back to work for you and Sophia again tomorrow?

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:12:24 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
fenric: Nope. Mike Massa did that jump.I have also doubled Spike in SCHOOL
HARD

scottj: Thanks & yep.

Just wondering if there is any chance that you'll get to be a vampire again?

CD1106 says:

I was curious......Are the majority of the sets for the show located at the
Fox lot on Pico or are they shot at a different lot all together. You
mentioned the library so I thought I'd ask.

No.1Buffyfan says:

jeff: why did you choose to work for buffy? do you guys have a low budget.

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:25:22 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
Michelle: Yes. I'm sure I will. Tomorrow I get to double  Nick so I just got
a new XANDER hair-cut today.

CD1106: We have our own little lot in Santa Monica.
No. 1: The budget is good. It's an all Union show -which costs quite a bit.
Actually it is a miracle that I'm on the show. At first Joss did not want me
because Sophia had become the fight double that he wanted and since I was
her boyfriend he thought it would be a problem. So he hired another guy.


The other guy was good - but he would not listen to Joss. Joss wanted
someone who could understand him and translate his vision to the screen.
Once Joss met me he decided to take a chance on me. That's why I'm so
determined not to let him down. I have argued with other producers - but
never with Joss. I actually love his ideas.


There is one other reason too. I had just left a show that I was shooting in
Europe early because my Dad was dying of Cancer. I quit and flew in to be
with him the last three days of his life. I was sort of stunned after that.
i felt like dying myself. The last thing my Dad said to me was not to worry.
That he would put in a good word for me.  I flew back to Los Angeles with no
job prospects and just as I landed I got a page --- from Joss Whedon! I met
him and within an hour I was the new stunt coordinator of BUFFY: the VAMPIRE
SLAYER. I have not slowed down yet. And I know that my Dad is watching me.

Michelle says:

Hi Jeff, you said David didn't do that jumping stunt, but was SMG allowed
to? Or was that Sophia?

Agent Orange says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:18:02 PST 1998 wt-d6-210.wt.net)
Hey Jeff Pruitt, thanks for stopping by! You were the vamp in the tash can
scene in Ted, right? I was wondering if it hurts a lot to get beaten up.

Rydini says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:17:13 PST 1998 pm-4-151.innovsoftd.com)
JEFF How much do the actors contribute to their stunts? Do they do more than
their doubles?

kate says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:15:47 PST 1998 dialup-tc3-10.minn.net)
Does Joss (or whoever the director for a certain ep. is) have any input on
how fight scenes are created? Do they tell you to do certain actions or have
certain things take place or is it pretty much up to you?

IMMORTAL says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:15:02 PST 1998 proxy3.sch.prodigy.net)
JEFF: I'm curious, do you film a fight scene from beginning to end or in
segments. Isn't there a point where there are just to many punches and kicks
to keep track of? Keep up the good work?

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:35:06 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
No.1: Always wanted to do action films since I was six.

Michelle: Sophia

Agent Orange: Yes

Rydini: Stunt Pros do the action/ Acting Pros do the acting

kate: Both. Joss trusts me now I do beleive. Sometimes I argue with the
directors if I think that they want to do something that Joss would not
like. I look for Jossness in the scripts and in the action too.

Immortal: Both methods are used. It just depends on how much time we have.

Jeff: just curious, but what do you consider the most difficult stunt
sequence you have done to date? btvs or other?

LadyJack@superior.net says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:33:01 PST 1998 pm1-alb-28.superior.net)
By the way sorry about your Dad, My grandfather just finished Chemotherapy
and it was very hard on the family. My prayers go out to you.

Sam Hain says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:25:26 PST 1998 n144.solano.community.net)
Jeff Pruitt: On behalf of the great poster Agela would you like to join her
Buffy Addicts Hospital or BAH? Joss joined and so did Scout, they are both
residents of the Joss floor. Joss didn't weant to play favorites with the
cast that's why he's staying on his own floor. So what do you say, want a
room?

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:42:21 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
gypsrat: Buffy has been the easiest really. The "construction fight" in the
POWER RANGER MOVIE was tough. so was a "chop-shop" fight that I did in a
litle movie
called MISSION OF JUSTICE. I played one of the characters there and had to
run back and forth between my little second unit and the main unit with the
star as we were shooting at the same time.

LadyJack: Thanks very much:)

Sam Hain: I want to be in any Buffy-club that will have me

Jeff: Happy New Year to you and Sophia. I hope that your holiday was a happy
one. The stunts in the teaser for the two parter look great...no wonder Joss
is so content with the
stunt work this year! You mentioned Kung Fu... Did you ever work on the Kung
Fu: the Legend Continues series (my pre Buffy favorite)?

Astro Boy says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:35:11 PST 1998 1cust216.tnt1.san-fernando.ca.da.uu.net)
Jeff Pruitt: I was wondering who I could contact for any entry level
posiions on BTVS? I am a film student and my mom works in the indrustry so I
don't have any real experince but I know how everything works.

AKA BECKER says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:36:15 PST 1998 ww-tr05.proxy.aol.com)
Jeff Pruitt: BTW, a person has been posting for a while saying he is your
brother, but he is never on when you are. Is it him?

CD1106 says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:36:15 PST 1998 pool044-max21.mpop2-ca-us.dialup.earthlink.net)
Santa Monica, eh? I think I remember you mentioning that. Is that the set
for the majority of the interior locations? Where in Santa Monica is that? I
thought maybe you shot on the lot in Culver City.

SE says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:39:28 PST 1998 172-177-173.ipt.aol.com)
Jeff: What kind of stunt are you doing for Nick??? Can you be specific???

JEFF PRUITT says:
(Sun Jan 4 20:50:28 PST 1998 ppp-63.ts-2.lax.idt.net)
Arctic Lurker: Sophia co-starred as Patrick McNees daughter on that show.

Astro Boy: email me and I'll try to talk to you later about it.

AKA: Thanks. My brother has told me that he sometimes goes here when he's at
school.

CD1106: It's right on the line with Culver City (I think)

SE: Nothing big. Just as a precaution. You'll have to wait till it airs
(sorry)

JEFF PRUITT says:

 Well... I gotta go take a phone call now. I'll talk to you guys later.
