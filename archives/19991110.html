<DD>  Okay.  I said I was leaving.  But I just have to address a thought to the guy who felt we were getting all "Buffy's Creek."  You're just now getting bothered by the amount of sex on the show?  Guess all that S&M and bondage stuff we did last season flew under your radar.  I agree we could use some more Xander/Giles fun - and it's on the way.  But if you're looking for 7th anything - the only thing you'll find on Buffy is naughty demons from the 7th realm of hell.  Not that we don't want to do stories that are positive and moral - but sex is a part of young peoples lives and it only gets more intense when they go to college.  Also - you might have noticed that a big theme of the show tonight was dealing with sexual urges and the intense consequences they can sometimes bring about when acted upon.  Not that I'm defensive or anything.  Or that a huge part of my life is devoted to the thing you just attacked...  I'm cool.  I'm fine.  It's just, you know - you are certainly entitled to your opinion and if you want to watch that scary Toddler on that other show - you go right ahead.

<DD>  Oh, so sleepy now.  Thanks for nice words.  As always, say the blessings for the high lord and master of all good things Buffy - the great and powerful Joss.  He always makes me look better in your eyes - and, again, I'll take it (and pray that someday I'll have learned enough to be half the genius he is.  And I'm not just saying that.)

<DD>  Bram - finished writing the epp - feels like a million gazillion years ago.  Probably back in August?  But I was was involved and looking at cuts recently - so it's not like it wasn't fresh in my mind.

<DD>  Be assured.  Both Giles and Xander will get their due very soon.  Working on an ep which is mostly about them right now.  In fact, have to be in about 8 hours - so maybe I should go to sleep...

<DD>  So the deal is - anyone on the board after the day change is part of the loser club?  See how quick I am to catch on?

<DD> Like oh so many of the quotable lines on Buffy - "times up, rules change" was straight out of Joss' mouth.  But since he's not lurking - I'll take credit.  In answer to the Danny Strong question - keep an eye out.  He's coming back very soon.

<DD>Good question.  Guess I'm intrigued by the animal part of our nature...  Lots of juicy metaphor stuff to play with in Buffyville.
