<DD>Kestrel: 'Night and thanks for the kind words.<BR>
<BR>
Witchy Woman: I absolutely cannot wait 'til Tuesday! I got to see a rough cut of the "Angel" opening and it looks SO good!<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius: I would love to work with Chris Beck sometime (he is brilliant!) but we wrote the theme with our producer, Holly Knight. We were asked by John King, the music supervisor for BtVS and Angel and all-around great guy, to submit some ideas for a theme and we got picked. I don't know who else was considered. We use cello in almost all of our music (instead of a second guitar) and it's featured prominently in the theme. The theme was written specifically for the show. I'm still pretty much in shock. *g*<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx: Thanks! And I second the birthday wishes.<BR>
<BR>
Gurlgreen: Thank you. Nice to see you here.<BR>
<BR>
Paris Angel: I think we may have talked once a while back but my memory is tres crappy! *g*<BR>
<BR>
FSM CDMan: Now that you mention it...! *g*<BR>
<BR>
XanderBrazil: Nice to meet you! If the rest of the show is even half as cool as the title sequence, it will be well worth the wait!<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen: Whew!<BR>
<BR>
Meteor: Small bills deposited into my Cayman Islands account *eg*<BR>
<BR>
Lady of Buffdom & gazoo: Thanks very much!</vgreen>

<BR>

<DD>Hi all!<BR>
<BR>
SO's to all my friends (and those who will be)!<BR>
<BR>
Well, in case you didn't know yet (and why would you, really?) Darling Violetta has written and recorded (along with our producer, Holly Knight) the theme for "Angel" and I just want to thank a few folks for making it happen.<BR>
<BR>
MEGA-THANKS to: Joss, John King, David Greenwalt, Pete, Adam, Chris, Skip, Fer, Larry Antonino, all the folks who helped whose names I don't know, everyone here who crossed their fingers and sent good vibes,whoever invented caffeine, and AKA Becker for keeping a secret extremely well!<BR>
<BR>
FREE music (no, NOT the theme! *g*) <a target='_blank' href="http://www.mp3.com/artists/23/darling_violetta.html">here</a>.<BR>
<BR>
All the latest (well, that's not exactly true right now) skinny on DV at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.darlingvioletta.com">The Darling Violetta Home Office</a>.<BR>

<BR>
Rebecca - thanks.  A rather nice if malnourished fellow named John King picks the music<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - yeah, she seems to like me, doesn't she  :)  I'm personally not a big fan of director's notes but I make an exception sometimes   :)<BR>
<BR>
Sorry gotta go!<BR>
<BR>

<DD>second-to-last post<BR>
<BR>
loki - thanks, my wife likes the score and that's enough for me<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow - AFAIK, Guinevere is currently only playing NY and LA - supposedly it expands on Oct 8 so maybe you'll have better luck then.  You can buy the soundtrack though, it's available now and has five score pieces on it.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Howie's music is indeed available, though maybe somewhat unreadily.  I really don't know.  He's unsigned.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Thy Slayer.<BR>
<BR>
smokey the bear - missed your first post, my name didn't light up (see I have an excuse)<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvious - OK, assuming for the sake of argument that critics are wrong to dislike my score in the first place, here's what I think.  I think the people who don't like the score are also people (for the most part) who didn't completely like the movie, and associate the score with a sentimentality that was the filmaker's intent.  Plus, rightly or wrongly, people hear wordless female vocal in a warm musical setting and think: Titanic.  Oh and Felicity.<BR>
<BR>
AngleMan - just finishing the big crossover in both series' episode 3.

Hi FSM Ron<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - hey it's good to know the site's back up.  (What happenned?)<BR>
<BR>
Terrina, Lady of Buffdom - thank you<BR>
<BR>
Giles' Lady - well I can always watch it when it airs!<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx - the music is a bit different, but not really by design.  I just let the episodes take me where they may.  And the whole seems to be a but lighter this year, both in tone and in the amount of music.<BR>
<BR>
Carita - I don't need Rolaids I need pie<BR>
<BR>
drdan - didn't they already?<BR>
<BR>

Lady of Buffdom, trbl4Giles - hi<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - heh heh - don't tell Joss!<BR>
<BR>
Actually another composer has been helping me out on "Angel" - on average a third of the cues - so it seems to be barely manageable.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - not a hockey fan - I guess my American Brainwashing is complete.  Guinevere getting mostly good reviews here too.  Curiously (at least I think so!) the score, when it's mentioned, is getting almost all negative reviews.<BR>
<BR>
Earth Girl - Unfortunately probably neither - collision of deadlines early next week.<BR>
<BR>
umbris - see below<BR>
<BR>
BeMu - Thanks for the heads up - LA is ready<BR>
<BR>
loki - At this point I honestly don't know how I could do a movie.  But I have trouble saying no to work I really get excited about, no matter how overloaded I am to begin with.  We'll see...

So questions this morning on the "Angel" theme - it is by Darling Violetta.  They recorded it yesterday.  I haven't really heard it yet but I'm told it's great.<BR>
<BR>
wolfguard - thems nice compliments, thanks<BR>
<BR>
Anais - The Rite of Spring happens to be my single most favorite piece of music in the universe.  Nothing like Guinevere though.  :)<BR>
<BR>
AL24-7, Angelina, FASTEDDIE - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Mabb - I'd have musical spoilers but I can't remember anything I write anymore<BR>
<BR>
drdan - yup, two shows are a lot; now three, well that's impossible<BR>
<BR>
Carita - my stomach is grumbling - that should tell you how long<BR>
<BR>
Oh by the way, there's a song in the Angel pilot by Howie Beck (the coffee shop).  Howie happens to be a friend of mine from Toronto and he's no relation.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear his song at the mix!<BR>
<BR>
Did I just give away the existence of a coffee shop?
