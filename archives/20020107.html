<dd>Christopher Marlowe:<br><br>Lucky you getting ANGEL DVDs. <br>It might be 5 years before the <br>USA sees something like that if <br>ever!! Pity Aussie DVDs wont <br>work here. Yes I wrote the music <br>for season one also, with Chris <br>Beck who mainly wrote for the first few <br>shows and he also oversaw my <br>music for the first half of the <br>season. My favorite scores for <br>that season are "Hero" and "THe <br>Prodigal"<br><br>superrmk<br>I'm from Adelaide, and I miss it <br>dearly. Consider staying in <br>Sydney as its much more <br>beautiful than LA. But if you do <br>get here look me up!<br><br>RedCrayon:<br>I work in a room full of samplers, <br>a keyboard, some computers <br>and mixers etc. I bring in real <br>woodwinds (Chris Bleth) and <br>other instruments occasionally. <br>Haven't done the band music. <br>The most groove stuff was in <br>Somnambulist which I did, <br>however (season 1).<br><br>Gotta run, and yes I'll be at the <br>PBP!!<br><br>

<dd>Aussie Bull Dog:<br>Ouch that hurts!!<br>If I had my choice what would it <br>be?....hmmmm, surround <br>sound, or Aussie <br>Coke....surround sound...Aussie <br>Coke....<br><br>Invisible Girl,<br>I have an invisible admirer!! <br>Cool. Fave musical piece: um, <br>gotta think about that <br>one.....thing is I just LOVE all the <br>film music that''s out there: all <br>the really emotional stuff!<br><br>All: might have to run soon. <br>Remember EPISODE 11. And <br>BDU when its back.<br><br>

<dd>superrmk<br>not strange: I'm an Aussie<br><br>Y_slaybelle: John King is music <br>supervisor: he does a lot of the <br>selecting of songs. For lots of <br>important ones, that might <br>already be decided however by <br>David Greenwalt and or Joss.<br><br>

<dd>Red Crayon:<br>Spoilery without being Spoilery <br>enough to black this out, and <br>THE reason I wanted to appear <br>here tonight to say....<br><br>Episode 11 is NOT TO BE <br>MISSED. Mere created a superb <br>script. An absolute hilight of an <br>episode!!<br><br>AussieBulldog: Yep miss <br>BuffyDownUnder LOTS. No <br>lamingtons, not yet anyway. <br>xantastic said he'd send <br>some....<br><br>Allyson from Pasadena: wow <br>cool to hear from you. I got a <br>surround system for Christmas, <br>did you hear it? (For those who <br>don't know, I live in Pasadena <br>too).<br><br>You're fairly right, I just sit here <br>and say "this will be the mood <br>for this" and hop to it. Of course <br>sometimes half way through I'll <br>scrap that and say "what was I <br>THINKING!!!?!"<br><br>We do have a meeting about the <br>music. Not much lead time, we <br>have the meeting to decide <br>where the music will go then I <br>have about 5 dyas to do it all. <br>Biggest crunch was for DARLA: <br>4 days and 37 minutes of music <br>to write. Turned out to be my <br>favorite score though!<br><br>Don't go to anyt of those BIG <br>meetings, wish I did, it'd be fun. <br>Though I did stroll by a glass <br>window and peered in on one <br>once. Made a few faces to Mere <br>and Tim as I went by.<br><br>Tim doesn't make big changes <br>to my stuff. Hate to blaspheme <br>but maybe we're on similar <br>wavelengths! (Maybe that's just <br>wishful thinking).<br><br>David Greenwalt's given me a <br>share of changes from time to <br>time: all part of the collaboration.<br><br>

<dd>Lilyana & Y_slaybelle<br>Yes I gotta say I love this color. I <br>used to go aqua on season 1 & <br>2. Bronze beta asked which <br>color and I said blue and wow I <br>love this! Thanks Artie!!<br><br>Christopher & chalkldusty:<br>I'm a bit slow... I only just <br>realised BDU means <br>BuffyDownUnder. Yes I miss it. <br>Yes I had a thread there about <br>the music for Angel. Everyone's <br>invited once the site is back up: <br>we laugh, we cry, we talk of <br>vegemite sandwiches...<br><br>

<dd>Red Crayon<br>(now there's a name). Writing  <br>Music for Angel would be the <br>answer. Yes I do it all the time, <br>I've been going full steam which <br>answers your next question as <br>to why I haven't appeared here <br>lately. I love it though: Bronze <br>Beta is the best!!!<br><br>AussieBulldog: you didn't ask <br>me anything but GDAY!!! Good to <br>see you here. I'm missing <br>buffydownunder.com, which by <br>the way is an EXCELLENT <br>forum site I recommend to <br>everyone not just the Aussies. <br>That site is down for the <br>moment however, bummer!<br>...<br><br><br>Newt: Joss teasing? Do you <br>really think he would tease us <br>about something?!<br><br>
