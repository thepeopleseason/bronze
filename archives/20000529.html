<DD><i>Last one</i><BR>
devil: Sounds great! Best of luck with the second year. There's a great book by Scott Turow about law school called 2L if I'm not mistaken...better check out his stuff on Amazon cuz my memory is shoddy! *g*<BR>
<BR>
Melody: Yes we are and sorry to drive your sister nuts but that's really all there is. Lots of our songs have a similar vibe, though and we have many available at MP3.com for FREE. Just search there for Darling Violetta or link from our site at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.darlingvioletta.com">The Darling Violetta Home Office</a><BR>
<BR>
Moment: I have to bail right now so I can't really get into it too deeply, but Napster and other sites and services are not in and of themselves evil...any more than an A-bomb or a .9 mm handgun but they have the potential to be just as dangerous to an artist's career. We believe it's totally cool to have free music available when the artist gives the OK. I wouldn't buy a car without test driving it. Fully half of our existing catalog and some unreleased tracks are on MP3.com. And if people like the free stuff we hope they buy the rest.  I only hope that half of the folks who have the <i>illegal</i> Angel theme on MP3 buy the soundtrack when it comes out! *g*<BR>
'Course, my only copy of the theme is one I downloaded...how ironic! <i>Book me, Danno!</i>  <BR>
<BR>
Jasmen: Sorry to hear that. :( <BR>
See you soon!<BR>

See you on 6/24 at the Gig?

<DD>FSM: Ahh, Jumbo's! Haven't been in a while but the memories! *g*<BR>
<BR>
I'm just killing a little time before I have to leave the house by hanging in the Bronze. Sneaking on the roommate's comp again! *eg*<BR>
<BR>
Cool to see Grant on Angel!

<DD>Lurking B: thanks re: <BR>
shot.  It was hard to get -- had <BR>
to bring in a frazier lense <BR>
(unlimited depth of field) to get <BR>
it.  Felt worth it.<BR>
<BR>
Adfam Hughes: he make the pretty.  <BR>
I was hoping to get him or Travis <BR>
Charest to do covers for Fray, <BR>
wish wish.  Alex Ross rules, but <BR>
I don't think he'd be right for a <BR>
Buffy book -- his stuff is <BR>
photorealism, which with <BR>
characters based on real people <BR>
would just look like stills.<BR>

<DD>Krispy Kreme.  For <BR>
vaguely naughty connotations <BR>
regarding same, Tracy Bonham's <BR>
JUMPING BEAN is the place.  Other <BR>
than that they're just a fine <BR>
yummy wholesome evil addictive <BR>
thing.  Do not give them to <BR>
writers, we'll all just get very <BR>
excited for about seven minutes <BR>
and then crash into a useless <BR>
stupor.  We do that most days.<BR>

<DD>I believe the show will <BR>
be syndicated come 2001, after <BR>
we've completed our 100th.  Don't <BR>
have the scoop on the DVDs.  Have <BR>
to go soon, this is my last <BR>
chance to do nothing.<BR>

<DD>Re: FRAY, we don't have <BR>
an artist set yet, so there won't <BR>
be a book or anything by the <BR>
convention.  Hopefully there'll <BR>
be some cool poster or some such.  <BR>
A Faith comic would be sweet some <BR>
time, but I'm not sure when.<BR>
<BR>
Re: Caramel and chocolate.  I <BR>
have no opinion whatsoever. I <BR>
just don't have one.<BR>

<DD>The end of vacation.  <BR>
Tomorrow we're all back at work, <BR>
making up those wacky stories you <BR>
all love so much except for the <BR>
ones you don't.  I see Chrissy <BR>
has been posting links for BITCH <BR>
magazine -- it really is good, <BR>
hardcore pissed-off feminism and <BR>
constantly laments the passing of <BR>
SASSY, which was my favorite mag <BR>
so I dig it even though they <BR>
vilified me for Angel, the big <BR>
hate re: gender stereotypes.  And <BR>
while I think the show is more <BR>
complicated than that, there's <BR>
some validity in their crit.  I <BR>
did shoot the first scene of the <BR>
series -- angel saves blonde in <BR>
alley -- wondering if I was, oh, <BR>
say, betraying everything I <BR>
believed in... again, not that <BR>
simple, but worth pondering.  To <BR>
sum up:  BITCH=cool, I=slim and <BR>
dashing.  Hmmm.<BR>
