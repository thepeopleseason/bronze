<DD>OK, REALLY last post...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Raven:</b>  I think you can get it off our site, no?  Or maybe <b>Little Willow</b> can help you out...I know she got WAVs from somewhere for the VC section on her site.<BR>
<BR>
<b>PsychoVamp:</n>  OK, too weird!  I grew up my whole life in Summit.  (Mountainside, actually, but just at the top of the hill, so I was way closer to Summit than to Westfield.)  My Mom works right on Springfield Avenue, and I went to Kent Place School.  Freaky, eh?  (Hope it doesn't snow!  Ack!)<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

<BR>
<b>Jimbo:</b>  I would be happy to...but you need to e-mail me with your full name (so I'll recognize the order) and a reminder to sign it, OK?  Also, I know of a POBox Seth uses, but I'll have to ask him first before I give it out, OK?  (Again, we'll do that through e-mail)  My addy's on this post.  To send stuff to me and Velvet Chain, write to:<BR>

<DD><b>CosmicBob:</b>  Well, we ate in all our favorite restaurants up there, did a little window-shopping, and went to the SFMOMA to see the Alexander Calder exhibit...very cool.<BR>
<BR>
<b>PsychoVamp:</b>  Hi there.  Long time, no see!  You know I'm from NJ, right?  So, that's where my Mom is right now...with my Dad, who's taking her out to dinner later.  (Ack!  Does this mean she'll miss Buffy??)  Anyway, yeah I'm sick, but it's just a bad cold.  I'll get over it.  <BR>
<BR>
<b>Melanie:</b>  Yes I am!!  I love surprises, though, so don't tell me!

<DD><b>devil:</b>  Bonjour!  Je suis malade.  Comment vas-tu?<BR>
<b>Earth Girl:</b>  Cool!  Glad you ordered it...when did you?  (I can give you a clue on how long it'll take...)<BR>
<b>oddstruck:</b>Well, I'm not at the day-job, actually.  I somehow got 4 days off in a row!  I spent the past 3 in San Francicso, and now I've got a cold, so this last day off I'll use to get better, I guess.  Anyway, I guess I'm having a fuzzy-headed-having-a-really-hard-time-typing kind of day.  =)</SMALL>
