AKA Becker - you have been strangely silent since I asked you about the promo CD...  You'll tell me next time, hmmm?<BR>
<BR>
lisa - OK, I'll check out the hospital, although I have no problem denying that I have any kind of problem.<BR>
<BR>
<vippink>Is it pink? bye all...  have a nice weekend.

<DD>Second-to-last post.<BR>
<BR>
KAM - looking forward to it.<BR>
<BR>
Troll - The Buffy bands' music is generally so different from the underscore, I can't see how one could influence the other.  But I have "discovered" several of my favorite CD's by virtue of their being on Buffy - notably Morcheeba and Cibo Matto (not to mention Velvet Chain and Four Star Mary).<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer - I think more about the emotions and dramatic intent in the scene than I do about specific characters.  I guess you could say the score is more situation-based than character-based.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - heya.  Hope you saw my appreciation below...

<DD>I'm getting tired of my col-or choices.  I don't want to blow the codes by trying an unavailable col-or, so tell me... what col-ors have you seen VIPs post in, if any, that I haven't yet?  I have red, yellow, aqua, blue, green, ... am I missing any?<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - sorry.  But you've got the right idea re: begging AKA becker.<BR>
<BR>
@llan - I haven't seen the xmas eppy.  I've only heard it described to me.  And Joss wrote & directed it so I know it's gonna rock.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - the site rocks!!  I'm so flattered & impressed.

<DD>MorbidMuch - I hope to work on "Angel" (Joss permitting), but I honestly wonder how I would have the time to do both shows.  We'll see...<BR>
<BR>
@llan - I mean B&tB's music score was a close second to B1.  As for my favorite episode, it changes weekly.  Usually my favorite is the one I'm working on, and in keeping with this tradition, my favorite ep is #8 ("Lover's Walk").  The Spike eppy.  As for my band choice for the CD - I love them all, so I couldn't possibly pick one...

<DD>Whelk - I respectfully <BR>

ZephyrHawk - I respectfully <BR>

fax1 - your page is... ummm... <BR>
very big & col-orful.  I'm very <BR>
flattered.  I feel truly sorry <BR>
for Joss the next time he posts.  <BR>
I have a feeling the word <BR>
"deluge" might be an <BR>
understatement...<BR>

re: a score CD.  Well, AKA Becker <BR>
let that cat out of the bag... <BR>
Promo CD's of season 2 score <BR>
highlights *do* exist in limited <BR>
numbers.  Unfortunately, I can't <BR>
send them out upon request... you <BR>
can imagine the mess that might <BR>
get me in.  So to be fair I must, <BR>
with apologies, decline your <BR>
req

<DD>AKA Becker - There are a few score promos floating around... I'd be very curious to hear where your friend got his.  Care to share?  Did you see it?  What did it look like?<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer - Your idea of killing me & Scott at the same time was the best ever.  Until you brought up the possibility of being killed by Dru... Now <b>that</b> is intriguing.<BR>
<BR>
And as for the score CD - until a final decision is made, write TVT records.  They're putting out the song album and as far as I know the final line-up is not set in stone. <BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel - Actually, submitting for the Emmy is relatively painless.  Only about half a headache.  A one-page form and a small pile of videos.<BR>
<BR>
k8 - I'll give you the short answers.<BR>
<BR>
favorite score: still Becoming part 1.  Still trying to top it - B&tB has come the closest so far.<BR>
<BR>
how I got started: did the USC film scoring program in '92-'93.  Got some ghostwriting jobs, which led to my own low-profile jobs, which eventually led to Buffy.  You gotta start somewhere, and that's usually moving to LA, buying a home studio, and sending your stuff anywhere and everywhere until somebody listens.

<DD>Lovely Poet - Good suck-up.  Good triangle playing too.  I feel appropriately flattered.  And I personally am not giving up on a score CD just yet... patience is the key...<BR>
<BR>
Sanguineus - heya.<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - e on the way.  OK, ya got me curious...

<DD>Lisa, Shadowslayer - hi<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - the characters do not have their own themes per se.  Usually each episode has its own set of musical material - though this can spill over into other episodes where appropriate.  There is definitely a B/A love theme (there are actually two) and W/X seem to be getting one as well.<BR>
<BR>
(nervous about the unavoidable upcoming tag - col-or me html-unfirendly) <BR>
bronzek8 - you are too kind.  re: <i>The Sound of Music</i>, it's been a while since I've seen it, but it's a gr8 movie.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Yes, the end of "Revelations" is a favorite score moment for me.  (Good memory) Come to think of it, so's the end of "Lover's Walk".  (The aforementioned acoustic guitar montage).

<DD>Margot - thanks and unfortunately you hope in vain.  No score (to the best of my knowledge, and I suppose I should know) will be on the soundtrack CD.  I have been tentatively approached by a smaller label to do a score-only CD, but this wouldn't be until 6 months or so after the song CD comes out.  If a score-only CD comes out at all...<BR>
<BR>
AKA Becker - I don't remember misunderstanding you before, but make no mistake - I do now. <BR>
<BR>
OK seriously AKA Becker, thanks.  And I am so very there (the PBP '99).  Apollo has offered me double the amount of money I usually get for posting, so I guess I'll suffer through it, like I do posting.<BR>
<BR>
bubbles - hi.<BR>
<BR>
OK seriously AKA Becker, for real this time, I *am* planning on being at the PBP, and I *do* come to the bronze 'cuz I like it.  And I appreciate your appreciation of that.

<DD>Returnage...<BR>
<BR>
Hi just me<BR>
<BR>
Bronzek8 - Re: music for upcoming episodes - It's pretty much gonna continue in the same vein as before.  Each episode has its own problems & challenges musically, of course, and there is a little acoustic guitar being added to the mix (for W/X and for a big montage at the end of "Lover's Walk"), but otherwise, we hear the tried-and-true big orchestral wall of sonic ecstacy we always did.<BR>
<BR>
Leather Jacket - the electro-humming rhythmic sound was me.  It's the "German Guy Theme".  It means "eine schpiegel guntig verboten".  It has been compared (though I've no clue why) to "Shaft".<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - just hangin wit me bronzepals.
