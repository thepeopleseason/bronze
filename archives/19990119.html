Okay, wicked ep.  Kind of a smorgasbord: a bit of "Flowers for Algernon", a bit of "Silence of the Lambs"...<BR>
<BR>
One <b>big</b> complaint, though.  About forty-five minutes into the episode, scary night scene when Joyce goes on the porch to find the Vamp in Buff's clothing.  Goosebumps.  Then, an abrupt cut to a scene with, I guess it was a family, but characters I've never seen before on the series, arguing about the pizza on the table.  First of all, the abrupt cut was a little disorienting, and second of all, the incredibly blatant product placement for DiGiorno's Pizza (they must have said the name ten times) was sad.  I guess Joss sold out a little.  Anyway, thirty seconds later, another abrupt cut to, big surprise, the cast of "Felicity!"  Okay, I'm thinking this must be a crossover episode for ratings.  I'm impressed at how well Joss and Co. have captured the look and feel of "Felicity", but what the characters are saying seem to have no bearing on the "Buffy" episode.  Then, a narrator (Angel?) puts in a blatant plug for that series.  WUWT?  Then, when things couldn't get any weirder, another cut to a man and woman I've never seen before kissing and plugging Winterfresh gum!  Come on!  Benefit of the doubt, maybe Joss is planting something and the gum will play a pivotal roll in a future episode (he is such the genius with that kind of stuff).  <u>Finally</u>, we cut back to Buffy arriving home, but it's night again, and it seems that it's supposed to be the same night that Joyce was abducted.  But the pizza scene and "Felicity" scenes were both daytime, so how could that be?  Is someone asleep at the continuity wheel?  Not to mention, all those weird surreal scenes in between just completely dissipated the dramatic tension when Joyce found the Vamp.<BR>
<BR>
Other than that, good ep.  Just please, no more weird, unconnected scenes like that.<BR>

<DD>Oh... probably should have mentioned that I would away until after tonight's ep.  Didn't mean to appear to be ignoring everyone.<BR>
<BR>
So, until later...<BR>
