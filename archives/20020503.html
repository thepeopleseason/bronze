<dd>SlayerSteph:  Welcome in advance.  Where are you moving from?<br><br>Turk:  I would love to.  Soon as I have the time.<br><br>The Partyman:  Thanks for the kind words.  Think I'm gonna need them.<br><br>ms.curious:  There is a master plan -- and it's all in Joss' head.  It's his world, and we lucky few are just happy to be writing in it.<br><br>Power_to_the_People:  The German's screwing with my work?  Don't make me come over there.<br><br>Impaler Genreal:  Hope you won't be disappointed.  <br><br>Okay, gotta fly.  My guests are getting out of hand.

<dd>Princess of Darkness:  Always a pleasure.  Not sure if Buffy 7 will be the last or not.  You never know.<br><br>Xanderella:  As long as you feel dirty.<br><br>Paradox:  All intentional.  And you should feel queasy -- I did.<br><br>SlayerSteph:  Hello, from one blonde to another.  You going to be at the Succubus Club when I come in?  Think I'll need protection from the fans that night.<br><br>Stake:  Thanks, I'll check that out and see if it's the one.<br><br>

<dd>Just a quick drive-by (friends over, X-Box must be played), but I wanted to stop in and see if anyone's seeing red yet.  Nah, I know you guys would NEVER read those nasty spoilers, would you?<br><br>
