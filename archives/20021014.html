<dd>Hi all!  I'm back.<br><br>Hey, Web Warlock.  I'm sitting 0 feet from where Buffy is written.  We are under the impression that our ratings are just fine!  We are a show that attracts advertisers in search of a very specific demo -- not just age but lifestyle, income level, etc.  These advertisers seem very happy.  And I don't need my master's degree in Linguistics to figure it out.<br><br>

<dd>Allyson -- how could you possibly think UPN could screw it up?  I mean, have you seen our promos so far this season?  In my book, "U.P.N." spells "genius."<br><br>And don't you find it interesting that Jane is dodging the making out with me question?<br><br>
