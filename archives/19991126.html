<DD>crossbow: not sure exactly where you were goining with that question, but here's a shot: every show is quite different.  on the production level there aren't many people working both shows.   these are two very difficult shows to produce (dollar wise and time wise)  there are so many effects both make up and visual that require lot's of time.  so it would be nearly impossible for any crew members to work both shows.  <BR>
<BR>
and  the sets have their own unique personalities.  it's really weird ... i used to think Buffy was always shooting late into the night. but on Angel... hell, he can't go out in the sun!! <BR>
<BR>
so i don't know if i answered your question or not... but there's many words up there.

LilBufBuf: The "R" is for Robert.... the "D" is for David.  And i go by R.D. Price.  it's really a long story.  While we were shooting the first season of Buffy my name just sorta became initials.
