<dd>hey guys... ducking in [small(quack!)[/small] to address a few things before i head over to the set, where Timmy Mineener is currently directing ep 9.  for those of you who've been crouching in Fred's cave for the last three years, i'll repeat:  Tim. Is. A. God.<br><br>"Fredless" mishmash:<br><br>FYI, there <i>was</i> mention of Angel's soul iSSSSues in the script, but they were cut for time.  specifically:<br><br>Cordy: GASP! No! We musn't! [You'll lose your soul!<br><br>Wes: To hell with my soul! (beat) Again!] Kiss me!<br><br>Cordy: Bite me!<br><br>the whole soul-in-hell-yet-again joke turned out to be a heck of a lot funnier in my head, and since we were running over anyway, it was snipped, a choice i heartily agree with. but i wanted to make it clear that we didn't NOT address the sitch.<br><br>that's it for now.  me = gone to set.<br><br>-m-<br>sigJTT<br><br>
