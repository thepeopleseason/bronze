<dd>Yes, I'll be at the PBP (as long <br>as Greenwalt doesn't SWAMP <br>me, but I think by the time PBP <br>comes around we'll be OK <br>schedule wise).<br><br>Thoin: Well, OK, just a teeny bit. <br>MIRACLES is about a young <br>man who investigates miracles <br>for the Vatican. He is struggling <br>with his faith, and is bothered <br>that his job often destroys the <br>hopes of believers. The pilot <br>episode introduces him to even <br>more paranormal activity that is <br>both wonderful and increasingly <br>dark and disturbing.<br><br>

<dd>jerrymc:<br><br>As far as the show working for <br>ABC goes, I strongly believe that <br>ANYONE who watches the pilot <br>will be TOTALLY HOOKED.<br><br>It grabs you from the start, and <br>leaves you wanting to talk about <br>it with everyone.<br><br>I don't wanna spoil it, so, at least <br>for now, I'm avoiding describing <br>what it's about.<br><br>

<dd>HI EVERYONE!!<br><br>Just wanted to announce that I <br>will be writing the music for <br>David Greenwalt's new show: <br>MIRACLES. <br><br>(Yes I am VERY EXCITED about <br>it!!)<br><br>Frankly, MIRACLES is a <br>SUPERB show, one of the very <br>best hours of television I have <br>ever seen. I feel very privelaged <br>to be a part of it.<br><br>I will be stopping by now and <br>then to shamelessly plug the <br>show, which begins airing in <br>January.<br><br>It is SOOOO GOOD. I got <br>CHILLS watching it!!!<br><br>
