<dd>With regard to the French-kissing--I'm happy to report that so far 94 lucky fans have received their promised Goddard make-out session.  If you did manage to remain spoiler-free and have not yet received your reward, just sit tight, we're working our way down the list.<br><br>Also, I should add that I am allowing people to "double down" with their kiss and try to remain spoiler-free for this season of Angel.  I think we all know what that means for you if you happen to pull it off...<br><br>Slayerkitten6902--I love Spike.  I wish we could have him on Angel this year.  Hm?  What?<br><br>Princess of Darkness--I don't know what you're talking about.  DeKnight's in some sort of emergency?  I bet it has something to do with him sticking his you-know-what where it doesn't belong.<br><br>And for your audition, perhaps you should sing "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter" by Iron Maiden.  Yes, you run the risk of singing the same thing everyone else is singing, but there's a reason the classics are classic.  Just make it your own.  Sing your little heart out, superstar.<br><br>Glow Boy--I like that name.  Did you give yourself the "Glow Boy" moniker?  I like the thought of you sitting around going, "I think 'Glow Boy' pretty much says it all."<br><br>Eirefaerie--I miss you.  Everyone's mad at me here at work because I just won't stop talking about you.  "Enough about eirefaerie already," they say.  "Eat it!"  I reply.  "If we hold not true to the beauty in life, then what not for be the purpose of living?"<br><br>And then they say, "Is this what you were like up at Buffy?"  And I say, "I hate all of you!" and then I run out of the room and go play with my Doug Petrie dolls.<br><br>

<dd>Hey, a new person!  Hi Jo.  Welcome.  I too am sad about the departure of Buffy, but am looking forward to the new season of Angel.  What do you think's gonna happen on the show this year?  Let me be more specific -- what do you think's gonna happen episode four... at the second act break... that doesn't step on the earlier Wesley scene?<br><br>Also, just so you know, we try to post all our responses in screenplay format.  You'll get the hang of it. <br><br>Great to have you!<br><br>

<dd>For the record, I think it's a load of crap that I ranked as the third favorite writer on this board.  Joss who?  I'm sorry, Jane what now?  Name one good episode that those nitwits ever...<br><br>Ahem.  It's an honor to be included in the same sentence as writers such as Joss Whedon and Jane Espenson.  I can only hope that one day I live up to this golden standard.<br><br>

<dd>Ah, how I've missed you guys.  I bet you all are wondering how life at Angel differs from life at Buffy.  As best I can tell, it's pretty much the same, except every time I have a good idea here, Steve DeKnight rubs my chest and says "That's my baby."<br><br>Also, David Fury works on Angel.  Who knew?<br><br>
