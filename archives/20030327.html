<dd>Kenickie - I could spend the whole day talking about how great that AFI album is.  In fact, let's do that.  What are you top three favorite songs on the album?  In order, please.<br><br>Allyson - Aren't I a card-carrying Fanatic?  So basically you're saying I could kick my own ***.<br><br>Well, that's true.  I'm pretty tough.<br><br>I'll be right back, gang.  Gotta go take care of some business<br><br>

<dd>Here's my Thursday CDs: <br><br>AFI - Sing the Sorrow.<br><br>The Datsuns - The Datsuns<br><br>The Donnas - Spend the Night<br><br>Queens of the Stone Age - R<br><br>Dunlin - So that Evanescence CD is good?  I like that one song, but then part of me thinks I'm gonna be embarrassed for liking it later.  Like that time I showed up to class in a Chubawumba shirt.<br><br>Strangestgirl - What's all this talk about next year?  Hey - the "Powers That Be" may have decided this is Buffy's last year, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it.  I'm holing up in this office, and I'm writing Buffy scripts until they drag my cold, lifeless body out of here.  Buffy For Life!  Screw everyone else!<br><br>Major Wiggins - I understand your confusion.  Did I mention they were honey dew melons?  That should clear things up.  And I refuse to call French Fries "Freedom Fries."  It's not like we changed Hitler-O's just `cause of some stupid war.  Geez.<br><br>ShadowQuest - You don't have to have internet access to be my Minion.  You just have to be really, really awesome.<br><br>OldManFan - Nope.  You can't transfer the prize.  We're making out.  Like it or not.<br><br>

<dd>I'm glad you guys liked the shout out.  Figured it was the least I could do for all that hardcore soul-shaking worship.<br><br>Sunburst - Fury flatters me.  The stuff that got cut, well, I don't know if I'd call it hilarious.   Mostly it was a bunch of jokes that made me laugh and made everyone else say, "I don't get it."  <br><br>By the way, we could probably title every one of my notes sessions "I don't get it."<br><br>Carita - he doesn't kick my *** at golf.  I beat him consistently.  I thought we went over this.<br><br>Littlexander - you can call me whatever you want.  As long as it has something to do with kings or gods or adonises (adonisi?)<br><br>Kessie - good question.  I wish I could have been the guy who said "The troll is doing an Olaf impression!"  <br><br>Cassie - Trachtenberg will not leave me alone.  It's always like, "What's Drew doing?"  "Where's Drew?"  and "Make sure Drew's not trying on my shoes again."  I swear, she's so in love with me.<br><br>

<dd>Isn't it cd Thursday?  What's everyone listening to?<br><br>Strangestgirl, denise - thanks for the kind words.<br><br>Soph - that Fury can be very persuading.  Especially when he's wearing hotpants.<br><br>CarpeDi - OMG OMG, it's good to see you too.<br><br>Halfrek - Anytime you and eirefaerie call for me, I'll be there.  Sooner or later.<br><br>Eirefaerie - I'm actually thinking about bringing Sisters to the big screen.  It'll be a lot like Charlie's Angels, but with more sisters.  I hope I can get McG to direct it.  <br><br>And I hear you have a birthday coming up.  Oh boy.  I'm already picking out my birthday suit...<br><br>Trouble - won't have to wait much longer.  <br><br>I've been practicing by French-kissing melons.  And a priest of some sort.<br><br>
