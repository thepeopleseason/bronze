<DD>mornin', y'all...<BR>
<BR>
<small>and bummed as i am about it, this is gonna have to be a drive-by.</small><BR>
<BR>
thanks to everyone for all the wonderful things they've said about the "Angel" eppy last night, but as much as i'd love to wallow, revel, and generally eat up the compliments with a big wooden spoon, i am honor-bound to report that Joss had a very large part in writing "Untouched".  kudos should, in all honesty, be directed more his way than mine -- a fact for which i will be eternally grateful, because it means my name's attached to a work of amazing quality. as usual, i prostrate myself before his greatness. <BR>
<BR>
<small>and i did type "prostrate", right? there was an "r"?  i'd hate to think i was male-sexual-glanding myself before his greatness.</small><BR>

<DD><i>last o' the eve'</i><BR>
Meteor: That's right, you were telling me about the network execs not running Angel yet. Duh! *g* Thanks for the congrats.<BR>
<BR>
Arana: I'm really just too lazy to e-mail Apollo for the new codes (and I'm sure they'll change before I get my own comp...sometime early next year I think...yay, I'll be a (ir)regular again) *g*<BR>
<BR>
lost boy: morning's that time when the sun comes up and you know that it's time to go to bed! *g* Is it any wonder I identify with vampires!?<BR>
<BR>
'Night Kenickie...see ya soon.<BR>
<BR>
Apologies to anyone I miss as I'm tired and typing even more slowly than usual!<BR>
<BR>
(non-Ty King-style) *poof*

<DD>Kenix: Well, now you HAVE to stage-dive!<BR>
<BR>
Amelia: That's what the Bronze is all about...new friends! I've never actually been off the continent of North America. In fact, I've only been out of the US for about an hour or so (and to Canada to boot!)<BR>
<BR>
lost boy: She's backing up an artist by the name of Amy Correia. She's a singer/songwriter type artist.<BR>
<BR>
<i>leaving soon as I've got an early mourning...er, morning to see to. I hate mornings!</i>

<DD>Kenix! Ya poppin' across the pond (and the rest of the US)? <BR>
<BR>
Arana: Ahh, but I DID recognize you (which is pretty amazing given MY memory *g*)! The last time the color changed, I wasn't sent the new codes and since I currently don't have a computer to call my own I just use the regular "toast" color when I do make it here. I think I'm gonna just keep doing that cuz I'm just a regular guy who is a big fan and I tend to think that color should be for writers and folks who are involved full-time in the creative process of the shows.<BR>

<DD>lost boy: Yep, plenty of both. I'm actually watching the abode of our very own cello queen, Gerri while she graces the East Coast with her wonderful sounds.<BR>
<BR>
Meteor: Eek! Now I remember why I went to music school! *g*<BR>
I don't know too many details but BBC 4 has a film crew in L.A. and somehow or other they were convinced to come and capture our essence.<BR>
<BR>
Amelia: How're ya doing!?
