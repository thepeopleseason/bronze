<dd>Ahh!  Ohh!  Eee!  Really want to talk to you guys, but gotta play the host (not the green one -- well,not yet anyway.  Talk to me after a few more beers).  Keep your questions in mind for when I can stop back and spend some time with you people.  <br><br>Would also love to go chat on the Kitten board, if anyone knows how to hook me up with that.<br><br><br>*poof for real.  really.  stop looking at me."<br><br>
