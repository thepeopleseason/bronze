<DD>StG: i agree... suggestions on party ideas are great and welcomed by the committee, they've said so repeatedly.  and thanks to all who supported me on my bike ride,  sans solicitation. OH and i just had to come back up here and let you no StG: none of the below is directed at you because of your post... believe me when i say i understand not being able to attend events because of cost, my friends who i think you know of, all make WAY more than i, and do things i can't afford.<BR>
<BR>
-mere-: one lucky guess, i get one out of every 15, maybe two, and i'm doing good?  nope still the dumb one.  i love you.  thanks for the talk.  hope you get some food soon. oh, and will you marry me? i'll bring you natural sponges.<BR>
<BR>
Further discussion (then i'm gone for good):<BR>
but direct attacks on the intentions of a small group of people (who are the ones taking time out of THEIR schedules, to throw a party FOR PBers)and that these committee people are trying to eliminate certain groups from attending... yeesh... that is not what i consider a suggestion or opinion... it's an accusation. <BR>
<BR>
what this really boils down to is that there really isn't any official "organization" here.  there's a group of people who have decided to throw some annual parties and invite only people (and any person wishing to attend... *repeat*) from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Posting Board and their friends, family, etc.  so indeed as far as I am concerned it's their party and they can do what they please.  Nobody owes anyone anything here... they are simply trying to do their best to have a get together... and for God's sake do some good in the world as well.  either you attend cause you wanna be a part of the hootenanny or you don't cause your are unable too.  About the price.  let me just say this.  on my first job out here i help throw together a party at the same location as this years PBP, we had just under one hundred people. the total cost was just shy of $8,000 dollars and it was a two hour event, no band and 3 little rooms. do the math. <BR>
<BR>
Well i guess i've ranted enough.  i just hate seeing all the hard work the committee has done (and even the money spent out of THEIR pockets to plan, visit and organize)being put down by a small handfull of... of.... of... cry babies. err.. that's so much nicer than what i was thinking.<BR>
<BR>
and i'm not speaking about the complaints on the price.  cause i so understand where you are coming from.  but that's the price, the plan, and it ain't gonna change for all the tears shed, so if you want to attend i'm sure someone here will help you out.  look forward to seeing you there. and yes even those of you who can't see fit to be happy someone took the time to put this  all together.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks PBP 99 committee... you've done a kick arse job.<BR>
<BR>
so gone,<BR>

<DD><b>katvamp:</b>  My lips, they are sealed!!  ;-)<BR>
<b>grrengirl:</b>  what the heck?  When did all this broo-ha-ha begin?  I know I may seem biased, since VC will be one of the unnecessary bands that Leather Jacket mentioned, but so far all the PBP activities/precautions have seemed absolutely reasonable.  I mean, I've only read afew of the complaints, but trust me, $30 for an evening in L.A. is NOTHING...even at a middle-of-the-road, nothing-special-about-it location.  And as for the "secrecy," they're just trying to protect everyone's interest by having the PBP be as cool as possible! you can't do that if a bunch of uninvited folks who paid nothing try and crash, right?  MHO.<BR>
<b>PsychoVamp:</b>  Cool!<BR>
<b>MTVA:</b>  Hmmm...now, that's an idea!<BR>
<b>MacLeod:</b>  Hi!  Well, we're working on new stuff right now, and we hope to have it all recorded by February...maybe we'll have an EP for you in March!

<DD>hello bronzers...  hope all is well.  much whuppage here in Sunnydale.  However lurkage ensues... so:<BR>
<BR>
now be aware i've only scrolled a bit, and some of this comes second hand.<BR>
<BR>
As for the PBP... well my take on it is this:  come if you want to come... don't if you don't... but for damn sure don't point the finger at someone (or small group of someone's)  and accuse them of being biased.  No body is trying to keep anyone, or targ
et a specific group by "making" the fee $60.00.  and for those of you (and it's really none of you friggin business) who feel it's wrong because last year was only $25.  well last year was only cheaper because Planet Hollywood got PUBLICITY from it.  <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, $60.00 for a party with a band and food, in Los Angeles, California ---- IS CHEAP!!!  and God help me it's hard not to name you, but if you insist on blaming  KAM, or anyone else who's working their arse off to put together a party for ANYONE
on the PB to attend... i'm gonna personally do all i can to raise the price to $200.00 bucks so your sorry arse can't attend. (and yes i'll cover the difference for the rest of you nice peoples, who are just happy to have a PB party)<BR>
<BR>
Still having a hard time not naming people, since these are the same friggin idiot who have been a pain since day one of this board - bitching and complaining about the board or the PBP's, etc.  You are the very people who've caused me to take my leave of
the PB for the past two weeks.  i'm tired of listening to you whine as though you are owed something.  try making a positive contribution to this community for once, cause you'll only get out of this arena what you put into it.<BR>
<BR>
ok, done venting.<BR>
<BR>
for those interested there is a PBP party in LA in Feb.  cost is $60.00, this covers the band, food, location, and a contribution to Make a wish foundation.  also there will be raffle items from the buffy offices, the money's from this to also go to make 
a wish.  so Make a Difference in someone elses life and come join in the fun that is the Posting Board.<BR>
<BR>
done now,<BR>
<BR>
RD<BR>
<BR>
-m-: i love you too.
