<DD>OK, I have to go, (even though I'm staying connected), but I had to respond to Jono:<BR>
<BR>
<b>Jono:</b>  Nope, I'm not rich.  I'm actually pretty darn un-rich.  I'm a struggling artist and I don't even have cable TV.  (Because I can't afford it.)  Which means I'll have to go over to a friend's house to see myself on "Win Ben Stein's Money."  (Ironic, eh?)  So, even though I would <i>love</i> to get DSL, I can't.  =(<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight!<BR>

<DD>OK, everybody, my Earthlink is being so horrible, I gave in and I'm now on hold with tech support.  I'm having a super hard time getting connected, and I keep losing it every minute or so....<BR>
<BR>
So, I'm gonna go.  Um, ben Stein was actually really really nice to me, and even said some flattering things about me on camera during the show.  Again, I don't want to give anything away, so you guys will all just have to watch it when it airs in March or April.  I'll let you know!  And our NEXT album probably won't be out til the end of 2001, 'cause we already came out with TWO albums this past year alone.  Moody Groove Music came out in April, and the new Live CD (enhanced with 20 minutes of video, etc.) came out in December.  Just last month.  So, we're kinda taking a little break, you know?  =)<BR>
<BR>
OK, I gotta go, before this computer drives me INSANE.  Bye!<BR>
<BR>

<DD><b>amberlynne:</b>  Hi!  Thanks for your order, and I'm so glad you like it!  The inspiration for that song was actually an answering maching message I left for Jeff one day where I was pretending to be a French girl who had seen him play and thought he was hot.  I ended it with, "I'll see you at the show, OK?  OK.  Bye-bye."  The rest grew from there.  The original version is way more techno.  It's on "Warm" and "The Buffy EP"  (a longer version.)<BR>
<b>Gileslover:</b>  Thanks!<BR>
<b>Dirty Socks:</b>  I really want to go!  But I don't know anything about it, am having a hard time finding out anything, etc.  I'm not sure I'll get an invitation...but if I do, I'm totally going!  (I sure hope I do...)<BR>
<b>Thoin:</b>  I don't want to answer, 'cause I want everybody to get the suspense-experience when they watch it!  But I did really well, and got a lot of screen-time.  =)  Oh, and the guy isn't on it anymore.  He moved on to "The Man Show."  The new co-host is Nancy Pimental, and she's really cool.<BR>
<b>TaraAnyaKate4eva:</b>  Hey!  Thanks!

<DD>Hey, everybody...just wanted to stop by and say howdy.  And to thank all of you who wished me luck for my appearance on "Win Ben Stein's Moeny!"  It was a blast!  I can't wait for it to air.  =)
