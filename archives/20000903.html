<DD>EverDee  - never met mr Smith.  As for writing, i'm pretty much winging it, tho I did get some old scripts of Alan Moore's to study for format.  And Buffy fans are the classiest people in the world.  (except for, like, lords and barons and stuff, they have all that classy money.)  (I suppose a baron who watched Buffy would probably be the classiest person ever, especially if he was drinking, you know, tea or sherry or something while he was watching.)<BR>

For a guy who complains about how much work he has to do, I sure spend a lot of time on the internet complaining about how much work I have to do!<BR>

i.e. bye.

<DD>greeneyes -- everyone ELSE takes tomorrow off.  Not bitter, I swear I'm not bitter -- that why they pay me the oversized $s.  Working on breaking my next ep --the shocking truth about Tara!  Tune in!  And i'm not lying like usual!

<DD>I was not bowled out -- I backed into the wicket thingie by mistake.  Nobody had told me what it was and I knocked it over and they informed me that I was out.  Not terribly sporting.

<DD>Thanks Haz and Kenickie - I left the numbers on Alexis' machine.  NO IDEA what they meant.  Played cricket ONCE in school, bored out of my mind.
