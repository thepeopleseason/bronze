Okay... here's what I'm willing to tell you.  There is a lot of very wrong stuff out there.  Hee hee hee.  (It amuses me.)  So... don't get all upset and disappointed... okay?<BR>
<BR>
And what I actually said about the crossover was that Angel 8 is incredible... I gave no opinion on Buffy 8 (my ep).<BR>
<BR>
Okay... actually leaving -- just wanted to unruffle some feathers I saw getting prematurely tousled.

<DD>Just one quick note, before I go...<BR>
<BR>
Noticed some of the speculation out there.  The one thing I can tell you about the B/A crossover is...<BR>
<BR>
IT'S GOING TO BLOW EVERYBODY AWAY!<BR>
(sorry about the shouting.)<BR>
<BR>
It's everything you could hope for.  <BR>
<BR>
And anyone who doesn't love it is a smelly stupid head.<BR>
(I'msorry.  I'm very tired.)</SMALL>

<DD> Oh, all right.  It's me.  But I can only stay on a few minutes.  Busy, busy.
