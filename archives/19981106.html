<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hmmm...I think I'm like a bizarre Xander/Giles/Cordelia hybrid.  I have the geeky, quirky Xander sense of humor, Giles' intelligence/book learning (or I like to think so) and Cordelia's vanity.  hehe

<DD>Hi, <b>Gabrielle!</b><BR>
<b>LittleWillow:</b>  Well, I'd love an Erika Says page!  Thank you very much!!!  As for the Buffy song, he said we'd let you use it, no problem.  But we don't have any clue on when it'll be recorded.  When do you need it by?  (Interview questions/answers are pending, I swear!!!)</SMALL>

<b>RyanH:</b>  I'll check when I get home.  I wonder why you haven't received it yet?  I'll follow up for you, OK?  (Are we talking about a CD order?  Or just the extra stickers??)<BR>
Hi <b>Jade, bubbles, Gregg!!</b>  I'm OK, but need to leave soon.<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Actually, I thought it was the best ep so far this season, but I got a lot of flak for thinking that.  LOL<BR>

<DD><b>Kyle:</b>  What do you mean????<BR>
<b>drdan:</b>  well, thanks for the vote of confidence.  We had a one-off label deal.  On a small, independent label.  They have no money to promote us, and are going out of business.  So, we've been doing what we can on our own to promote oursleves.  And we've been doing pretty darn well!  We are currenylt looking for a new label deal.<BR>
<b>LittleWillow:</b>  Hello, sweetie!<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Just e-mail me with your full name and the new info.  I'll update it for you.

<DD><b>oddstruck:</b>  You can ask whatever you want...as long as it's not obscene or something!  lol  Well, my two favorite places to play in L.A. are the Key Club (formerly Billboard Live) and the Troubadour.  In that order.  Another place I love, but more for the vibe and the coolness of the people there, is Cafe Club FaisDoDo.  Crappy sound, but we always have fun there.  It's like having a party!<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hmmm...something to talk about...have you signed up for the VelvetChain discussion group?  (Mailing list?  Newsgroup?  Whatever...)  It's at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.onelist.com">www.onelist.com</a>  The name's VelvetChain.  (one word.)  Subscribe!  (If ya want to...)<BR>

<b>Lady Bathory:</b>  Thanks!<BR>
<b>Blackheart:</b>  I'm well, but museless, as I'm at my day-job.  And you?<BR>
<b>Dianne:</b>  Good ear!  It is indeed an oboe...plus a little flute.  (I forget, do you see the oboe much in the video?)  As for "Sad Lise," I'm unfamiliar with the tune, but I admire Cat Stevens a great deal, so any comparison to his work is a compliment!

<DD>Hello, everybody!  How's it going?  I have a little favor to ask those of you who consider yourselves Velvet Chain fans.  Go to the following <a target='_blank' href="http://www.cdart.com">site</a>, and put in your favorable rating of our video, "Emily."  Just click on "Artists," then drag down to Velvet Chain, and go from there.  It's a site that features videos from indie bands, and ranks them by popularity...well, I've discovered that WE NEED VOTES!  Could you help me out?  <i>Please??</i><BR>
<BR>
Anyway,hi!  =)</SMALL>
