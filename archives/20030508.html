<dd>thanks again to all the Beta Bronzers and I got to see the Buffy finale with Joss and the Buffy writers the other day, and it rocks so very very hard.  You're in for a good time.  Gotta scram.  See ya'll.<br><br>

<dd>No relation to Mike Minear.  though James Ellroy asked me a not disimilar question... hmmm.  <br><br>Our script coordinator is neither blonde nor a stunt driver.<br><br>"Wonderfalls" is, well, Touched By A Crazy Person.<br><br>

<dd>atter, in fact I'm running a new show for Fox called Wonderfalls, and we start airing in August, to get a jump before The Wrold Series (hopefully Wonderfalls won't get stomped on by sports the way "Firefly" did.)  But whatever happens, the last four years working on "Angel," "Firefly" and working with Joss and all the folks at ME has been a life changing experience for me.<br><br>

<dd>Thanks lurking b.  And actually it's Wonderfalls, not Wonder Walls.  Though could be a spin off.<br><br>

<dd>thanks, sunlit.  Looks to be my last ME eppy for a while, anyway, so thought I'd do a drive by and say thanks to all the viewers over the last years.  So, hey -- thanks.<br><br>
