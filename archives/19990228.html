<DD>Thanks for the x-files comments - I think I'll watch it actually.<BR>
<BR>
Buffy Sheridan - there will most likely be a score CD - it just won't happen for a while, at least until well after the song CD has been released.<BR>
<BR>
stakeme - that wasn't exaclty my brother's band per se, it was sort of a one-time thing.  He just got signed to Kitty-Yo records in Germany, supposedly a single comes out in th UK in August, then the whole CD in Jan 2000.  I'll keep you posted.<BR>
<BR>
OK, have a nice Sunday nite... <BR>
<BR>
Bye<BR>
