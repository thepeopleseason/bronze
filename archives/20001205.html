<DD>Wolfguard, hola!<BR>

PlainDave--I'm of two minds.  First, I absolutely think it's just a matter of a logical creative progression that explains the similarities that pop up between books and show.  I like to think it means I'm on the right track. On the other hand, the Spike thing was frustrating (if you haven't read the book, I won't spoil it here).  But it's their show, 100%, and you know going in that they're unlikely to ever acknowledge anything you do, so you're prepared for it.  Frankly, just the fact that they used the last name we gave Jonathan in the yearbook was more than I expected.<BR>
<BR>
Zak--yep, by Nancy Holder, Jeff Mariotte & MaryElizabeth Hart.<BR>
<BR>
Moloch--Thanks!  it's a merry little romp.  : )

<DD>Hey all.  Haven't been here in a dirty dog's age.  Thought I'd drop by and say hey, and who's here?  My bodyguard, Little Willow!  *waves*<BR>
<BR>
Hey Lady Wolfsbane.  : )
