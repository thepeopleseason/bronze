<DD>VelvetSlayer:  Glory was blonde, and so was Harmony.  And Anya?  We'll see a lot of her before she dies -- uh, takes that really long vacation to the tropics.<BR>
<BR>
Biobabe:  You gotta come visit us in Los Angeles.  The PBP here is the only one the writers attend (because of time).  Come on, you know you wanna.  One of us... one of us... one of us...<BR>
<BR>
@lex H:  A dog with a gorilla's brain?  Why, that's just crazy.<BR>
<BR>
And that's it for this dancing butt monkey.  I'll try to pop back in next Friday.<BR>
<BR>
Special thanks to Boo and Tiggy for the wonderful DeKnight sites.  You guys rock!<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>Tiggy Baby:  Yeah!  You're here!  Wow, I didn't even remember mentioning Freaks on the Succubus Club.  Your Steve brain is better than mine.  Huge hugs and thanks again for the Sister Site.  All you Bonzers who haven't sent her your pictures -- let's go!  Give us a peek at your bad self!<BR>
<BR>
andeeh:  You found just the right words.  Thanks so much for dropping by.<BR>
<BR>
Angelcakes:  Purrrr!  Kitty sleep.  Steve pet Kitty.  Steve sleep.  Dream of mice.  Mmmmm.  Fuzzy.<BR>
<BR>
Kronos:  Ha ha ha ha ha!  A classic!<BR>
<BR>
Satachrist:  To plan the season, we generally know the beginning, middle, and end, a lot of specific stuff that needs to happen.  We don't map out every single ep before we start writing -- not enough time.  But if we ever get stuck, Joss has this roomful of monkeys with typewriters, although they tend to spew out nothing but Shakespeare.  Bad monkey, bad!<BR>
<BR>
Ergoshakes:  She of the hoochie Underroos -- welcome!<BR>
<BR>
Okay, one quick last round, then this kid's gotta get on with the gettin' on!

<DD>Biobabe: I'll be there (barring any gorillas with dog brains).  Hey, I didn't see your name on DeKnigt's Riders.  Holding out for a special invite?  Well heck, I'm inviting ya.  And I trust you'll be making it to the PBP in LA, right?<BR>
<BR>
Souless Techwriter:  You are correct.  That's exactly what happens.<BR>
<BR>
@lex H:  Don't know about the crossovers.  I'll keep my ear to the ground and wait for Joss to step on my big fat head.<BR>
<BR>
little miss muffet:  Aw, go on with you!  Blush, giggle.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  Ah, glad to have the chance to clear that up. Glory has been around for almost forever -- in her own demon dimension.  After she lost the war with her two fellow Hellgods, they cast her out and into ours, placing her in the body of cute wittle newborn Ben.  So she's only been physically in our dimension for around 25 years.  Hope that helps.<BR>
<BR>
Cuchy:  Thanks!  Actually I'm a big fan of the crust. I'm a bit crusty myself.  Grrrr!<BR>
<BR>
Kronos:  Tiggy in a gorilla suit?  Grrrr! (and not the crusty kind)<BR>
<BR>
BeaBuffyte:  Ding ding ding!  It was indeed from Todd Browning's Freaks.  If you guys have never seen this old thriller -- go rent it!  It'll creep the bejeezus out of ya!<BR>
<BR>
Risa:  Nope, no kids.  No wife either.  But hey, look!  A sandwich!  Mmmm... peanut butter and jelly...<BR>
<BR>
Rikki:  Dry those tears, baby baby!  It's all love in the house that DeKnight built.  <BR>
<BR>
Mango-tastic:  Yeah, there's this new Buffy writer, Drew something or another.  Kid has potential -- to get the pile driver come Monday!  KA-POW!  Did I give you the chills? ;)

<DD>LittleHen:  Of course I'll be at the PBP in Feb.  I'll be the wee fellow with a trinkle in his eye (depending on how many drinks I've had).<BR>
<BR>
TheName:  Portal?  Blood?  You know I think I might have missed that episode.  No, seriously, it's kind of a long explanation.  When I have more time maybe I'll get into it (depending on how many drinks I've had).<BR>
<BR>
Taliesin:  Comics are good clean fun!  Okay, the good ones aren't that clean, but most fun things aren't.  ;)<BR>
<BR>
Phil PhuD:  Ben/Glory didn't share thoughts, but they knew about each other through --hey, look!  A gorilla with a dog's brain! Run!<BR>
<BR>
Numfar's Pooh Bear:  Yes, it's true.  Shannon Doherty will be a semi-regular on Season 6 of Buffy.  She'll be playing Amy the Rat.  (Oh, I so did not say that.)<BR>
<BR>
abt:  Oh, that's what a bounder is!  Whew!  For a minute there I thought it was something bad.<BR>
<BR>
Gilly Rosenthol: Joss tells us everything.  Wanna know how season 6 ends?  Get outta here!  BAP!<BR>
<BR>
Souless Techwriter:  No summer vacation for this mighty mouse!  Hey, nice pic on Tiggy's site.  You look like you might have just a smidge of soul left.  I can make you a sweet deal, if you're intersted...  Bwah ha ha.<BR>

<DD>Biobabe:  Cool.  Then I guess we can hang.  String Theory under the summer moon?<BR>
<BR>
Thinny:  Welcome to the family.  One of us... one of us... one of us... (Quick, everyone, what movie is that form?)<BR>
<BR>
Cushy:  Chocolate is always good, my friend.  No word on an Angel ep for yours truly yet.  Right now I'm tied up with my Buffy ep and another animated script.  But a boy can dream...<BR>
<BR>
Evalie:  Don't know if 5 will be an actual Halloween ep, but I'll try to make it extra spooky (kinda like me).<BR>
<BR>
Sklyer:  Ep 5 spoiler?  Hmmm... Two things.  Gorilla.  Dog's brain.  'Nuff said.<BR>
<BR>
vampireinabasement:  Yeah, I didn't know what to get you, so I thought maybe an ep would do.  If you don't like it, you can return it for something really useful.  Socks are good.<BR>
<BR>
hostile 17:  Ah, what might have been.  I have no idea why Dru wasn't included.  I was kinda late getting to the table last season.  But personally, I think the plate was kinda full without her.<BR>
<BR>
Rikki: We've already starting writing for season 6.  Yeah, I'd love to do something lighter than Blood Ties or Spiral, or something really, really creepy.  Like a gorilla with a dog's brain.<BR>
<BR>
Must... have... sandwich...<BR>
<BR>
Keep talking -- be right back.

<DD>Kronos:  Sorry, I was 20 minutes late.  See, there was this gorilla with a dog's brain, and -- well, let's just say it got messy.  And what the hoo-hah is a bounder?<BR>
<BR>
Biobabe:  See, I told you.  But make sure you correct your friends -- Selma Blair looks like YOU, not the other way around.<BR>
<BR>
LittleHen:  Be bold, baby!  Be bold!<BR>
<BR>
Narrator: Yes, a slow acting spell.  Works a little slower on Dawn actually because of her keen Keyness.  Nice observation.<BR>
<BR>
genrefan:  I've been badder than I can relate on this family board.  Bwha ha ha.

<DD>Evalie:  Yeah, kinda figured you were the one on right.  Nice pic!  And why yes, glad you asked, we have just started breaking my first ep of the season.  I was originaly scheduled to do ep 7 but got bumped over to ep 5.  I believe it will air on October 30, but heck, what do I know?  I bombed out in Calculus, so I guess I won't be able to pal around with Biobabe.  Sigh.

<DD>Yo ho ho beautiful Bronzers!  Just a drive-by to let you all know I should be dropping by between 3 and 4 this afternoon for the usual thrills and spills (PST of course).  Be there or incur my mighty wrath!  (Oh, I'll give you such a pinch!)
