<dd>Nuphalanx -- Sorry, out of the ANGEL loop these days so I can't help you there.  Things too busy here.<br><br>LenS - I'm a quintuple threat: Actor/writer/singer/director/poster.  What can I say?  Just waiting for them to call me down to the set when they're ready.<br><br>Thank you, Head Bitca Allyson.  I'm afrain Tim will always beat me as he is a god whilst I just walk among them.  (Sometimes, limp.)<br><br>

<dd>Artie - No apologies nessa.  It's my lack of experience on this site.  Thanks for helping me out.<br><br>KC - I've answered that in countless interviews... Briefs, of course.  As I've quoted Kramer "My boys need a home."<br><br>paks - I prefer to be devoted to drew on a more... personal level... If you know what I mean... wink wink... knudge... knu-- Okay, enough of that.<br><br>Lilyana - Has Pearl Harbor been bombed again?   I really have to pay more attention to the news.<br><br>

<dd>Whimm - No.  It's very well lit and Buffy's not wearing a stitch.<br><br>Archaic - I love onions.  I'm flattered.  (Also to have Aurora's nose up my butt.)  Don't listen to him, Aurora.  He's no music lover.<br><br>Sarah's carl -- We'll wrap with episode 14 before the holidays.  Then Doug Petrie directs ep. 15 when we get back.<br><br>

<dd>Great taste, Aurora.<br><br>Shpadoinkle - James is game for anything.  Including balls out (no pun intended) nekkidness.<br><br><br>Okay, pun was kinda intended.<br><br>Thanks anyway, LenS.  I'll get back to you with those numbers later.<br><br>And miller's angel -- QUIT YELLING AT ME!!!  He's nekkid, okay?!<br><br>

<dd>Oh, Buffy very naked in my episode.  Full frontal.<br><br>Thanks, Lilyana.<br><br>Thanks, paks.  Marti DID rock.  No question.  But she had a whole stanza.  I had one frickin' line!  Let's see YOU rock with that, buster. <br><br>Or ma'am.  Whatever you are.<br><br>Thanks, newt.  Directing's been big buckets of fun.  (Except for the moments of kicking myself for writing a really, REALLY difficult episode to direct.)<br><br>

<dd>Mustard Guy - The question is will YOU be happy with the ep. I've written and (in 90 minutes) will finish directing.  It's a rompy little trifle, something I suspect will not be liked in certain circles.<br><br>But there is naked Spike, I can promise you that.<br><br>
