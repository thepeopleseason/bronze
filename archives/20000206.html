<DD>Well, I'm out.  Sorry I can't stay longer but get off my BACK already I'm busy.  I just wanted to connect with you, my fans, the people who matter, and get free publicity.  Have good sundays.<BR>
<BR>
As ever, j.

<DD>just snuck into the TNT site.  Coolness.  Amber's pretty special.  Plus the site played music which freaked me out (see how little I know about your modern webplace?  Am I not a FOOL?)

<DD>I have no idea ewhat spoilers are in the Buffymag.  I shudder to think.  But it's impossible to keep secrets anymore, as I've learned.  (At least the EW thing was responsibly reported.)  That's why I didn't bother to keep a lid on the whole naked-gay-free money thing.  You'll all find out, soonrer or later.  The whole world is connected.  Everybody knows what everybody is doing.  the government has a camera in my bathroom.  You know the drill.

<DD>Well.  The posting board.  A place for laughs, for romance, for leaking information...  You know, I came on last week, chatted a little about the willow/tara dynamic -- couple of days later it's in Entertainment Weekly.  Crazy modern world (see: Metal Horses), it confounds me so.<BR>
<BR>
The truth is, I was a little wigged by all the commotion my posting caused.  I think the worst thing that could happen would be for the willow/tara storyline to become some kind of publicity stunt.  I guess if I type something here, the papers are gonna pick up on it, and there's nothing I can do about it.  So I'd like to make the following announcements:<BR>
<BR>
1)FROM NOW ON, EVERYONE ON BUFFY WILL BE GAY.  You heard it here first.  And not just a little gay, either.  Whole new show.<BR>
<BR>
2) MATT DAMON: MONSTER FIGHTER.  Yes, a multi-episode arc feature the talented mr Damon -- and look for some of his movie star friends to make "montrous" cameos!<BR>
<BR>
3)FREE PRESENTS AND MONEY for everyone who tunes in.  Swear to God.<BR>
<BR>
4) NUDITY, NUDITY, NUDITY.<BR>
<BR>
5) NAKEDNESS.<BR>
<BR>
6) ZEPPLIN FIGHT OVER NEPTUNE!  Just in time for sweeps, the gang is going to have an "out of this world" adventure -- with wacky Xander at the controlls!  This episode is budgetted at 18 million dollars, and will change history.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay!  Well, I'll just settle back and let the publicity come rolling in.  Yep, ratings are bound to soar once everyone gets wind of the exciting and controversial direction I'm taking the show in.  In the meanwhile, I hope you, the fans, enjoy the all-nude, all-gay Buffy.  It's gonna be a hoot!<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely (except for the sincerity part), Joss.
