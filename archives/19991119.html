<DD>Well AKA Becker, if you are the man you say you are, come out from your underground cave and show me how on Monday!<BR>
<BR>
The Annointed One was hoisted by Spike, into the sunlight and it's assumed, burned to death.

<DD>Lovely Poet, thanks, I think I will come 'round more often.  Certainly after Something Blue airs (if it's not one of our crazy late nights o' writing).<BR>
<BR>
Alaric, 'fraid not.  I would love to -- esp. Cape Breton Is., but I've never been further east than Montreal.  I've been to every province west of there, though.

<DD>Whoah!  Does Jane have this much trouble keeping up?  Probably not, she's lightning fast...<BR>
<BR>
Let's see... No, I won't write an Angel this year.  <BR>
<BR>
Strawberries, I did miss Autumn, but I'll be back for Christmas, as my entire family is there.<BR>
<BR>
I've seen most of the first three seasons, or at least read the scripts.  I was a fan of the show, but found it aired at an awkward time for me, in Canada, and so often missed it.  I'm pretty much caught up, now!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You guys are so sweet with your compliments!  This is cool -- I'll have to stop by more often ;-D

<DD>Stephen, sorry I didn't answer your question.  A bit overwhelmed here!  But let me try.  <BR>
<BR>
It takes us ideally 9-13 days to write an episode.  This is once the ep is broken to Joss' approval, and after an outline is written.  Sometimes, we don't have the luxury of 9-13 days, and it must be written in 7ish.<BR>
<BR>
To get in a Buffy-writing mood, I usually pick appropriate music (sad and slow or fast and actioin-y or...whatever) and play it over and over while I'm writing.  I'll read some of Joss' scripts, too, before I settle down at the keyboard.

<DD>Yikes, can't keep up with you guys!  Sorry if I don't answer all your questions...  Nope, I'm not a "special guest", I'm an extra special staff writer.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I'm from Toronto, Canada.  I was born and raised there.  Lived there until April when I moved to LA to take this job on Buffy.  Any of you from Toronto or Canada?<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow, you're welcome.  Can you post a link to your page?<BR>
<BR>
My next ep. will air Nov. 30.  It's called "Something Blue".  Man, hope ya like it.<BR>
<BR>
Lil Bufbuf, go to bed right now.

<DD>Joss would love to come on and post.  But as you all know, he's so busy it's really tough to find the time.  We all keep him up on what you're saying, though.  And when he has a sec, I'm sure he'll be here.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking a story involves Joss and writers in a room, developing an idea for a story into actual story points (a number of points and/or scenes in the Teaser and four Acts), and writing them down on a dry-erase board.  Also discussed are story arcs, themes and much of what has nothing to do with the story itself.  Laughter inevitably ensues.

<DD>Shadowslayer, you're forgiven.  It's been a prob all my life.  What can ya do?<BR>
<BR>
Right now, perhaps even this very moment, we're filming episode 11 -- the ep written by Marti, Fury and Jane.  We broke ep. 13 today, which Mr. Fury will write.  We'll start breaking 14 Monday, I guess.

<DD>We were breaking an ep. this aft. with Joss when Marc stopped by.  He said he plans to stay a lurker a little longer, but I will let him know how badly you want him on next time I see him.

<DD>Hi all.  On for a really brief time to say... I'm so glad you're all into Marc.  He's great.  And most importantly, Buffy's butterfly pajamas?  Uh, don't know where she got 'em.

<DD>Okay, from now on I will only refer to Willow as a witch.  Giles, Anya and Riley are now wiccas.  <BR>
<BR>
How's that?<BR>
<BR>
And Joss has been itching to get on the board, but go figure, he's been busy.  I imagine weekend postings, but I'm just speculating.

<BR>
Okay, if Ty King can do it...<BR>
<BR>
My next ep. is Angel 10 ("Parting Gifts"), then Buffy 11 ("Doomed") written with Marti and Jane, then Buffy 13 (catchily called "Untitled").<BR>
<BR>
As for Marc... He lurks, people... he lurks... he could be lurking at this very moment...<BR>
<BR>
And I've already encouraged him to post.  I believe you'll be hearing from him shortly.
