<dd>On the advice of my dear friend <b>Little Willow,</b> after this post, I am going to rest.  ;-)<br><br><b>eirefaerie:</b>  LOL...  I think it was a combination of the two. No offense to Canadians, of course!  :-P<br><b>DeAn:</b>  Hi!!!  Just finally finished off the lovely chocolately goodness you brought me.  Thanks again!<br><b>Nolte:</b>  Well, thanks for the Wow!  It <i>is</i> really hard to pass the exam to get on the show in the first place, so I guess I should be proud of that.  =)  And I know he was being jerky 'cause they introduced me as an "actress and singer form Los Angeles, California."  If I'd been a zoologist from Toledo, I think he might have been nicer.  ;-)<br><b>Mia</b>:   Awwwwwwwwww...  I'm sorry you missed it, too!  And I promise we'll let everyone nkow if and when we go on another tour!  (I can't believe our last U.S. tour was over 4 years ago!  Sheesh!)<br><b>sunlit5:</b>  hehehehe  Well, tell your Mom she can stop asking you until July!<br><b>helygen:</b>  Hi there!<br><b>L.W.:</b>  I'm gonna rest, Ma, I promise!<br><br>

<dd><b>HumVee:</b>  Hiya!<br><b>sunlit5</b>  I lost, but I still get $1,000 for coming in third (and making it into the Final Jeopardy round).  What kills me is that I was debating between two possible answers for Final Jeopardy, and I went with the wrong one...and if I had chosen correctly, I would've won EVERYTHING!  One of those great come-from-behind-to-win-it-all scenarios!  Oh, well.  The show will air on July 10th, if you'd like to tune in.  =)<br><b>eirefaerie:</b>  Hi, there!  I totally remember you.  I complimented you on your dress, if I remember correctly!  =)  I wouldn't say Alex scared me, but he was an @$$ to me, that's for sure.  I don't want to get into it, but he was truly a jerk.  Yuck!  We'd love to come play in Austin...it all depends on whether this <i>possible</i> label deal become a <i>real</i> label deal!<br><b>dust'em:</b>  That's great!  I'm so glad you like it!  I can't wait for the album to come out.  And like I said above, if we get a deal, we'll be touring, so Atlanta is definitely a possibility.<br><br>

<dd><b>Tijuana:</b>  Just one so far.  (With this play I'm in, it's hard to schedule gigs, you know?)  We're playing at 14 Below on Wednesday, April 2nd at 9:30pm.  Should be a fun gig...  It's a friend's birthday party, too, so there'll be food and stuff.  I definitely want to come see you guys play sometime!<br><b>Angelicious:</b>  Will do!  And I'd love to see the pics!<br><b>Kenickie:</b>  Hi there!!<br><b>Kessie:</b>  Hello to you!  And yes, things are going well, thanks!<br><br>

<dd>Nolte - I think the Cat Club is a fairly intimate venue, which is exactly the way I like it.  Are you in a band?<br><br>Kenickie - Where does your band usually play?<br><br>Erika - Love your band...any gigs coming up?  I'll spread the love to the King man.  <br><br>Ceirdwyn - mp3s not ready yet.  sadly I'm at the mercy of mp3.com.<br><br>Kessie - the best advice I can give is to try and write a spec show currently on the air that you are very familiar with.  You can then send that script around to agaents to try and get representation.<br><br>

<dd><b>Nolte:</b>  Hello!  Well, thank you very much!<br><b>Wacther X</b>  Everything's going really well, thanks!  The play just opened this past weekend, and our first review came out yesterday (in <b>Variety</b>), and they really liked it!  Also, the band's got a gig on Wedensday, April 2nd, and I'm shooting another indie feature in May.  Busy, busy!  How are you?<br><br>

<dd><b>Tijuana:</b>  Hi!  I don't believe we've met, but I wanted to say hi and I hope you have an awesome show on the 11th!  I'm currently in a production of <b>"Sunday in the Park with George"</b> over at West Coast Ensemble on La Brea, so I won't be able to attend...  But I'll be there in spirit!  Please say hi to <b>John King</b> for <b>Jeff Stacy</b> and me!  (We're from the band, <b>Velvet Chain</b>.)<br><br>

<dd>I know I posted this yesterday, but I want to extend the invite to people who may not have seen it.<br><br>I'm Tamara the script coordinator for the show and I wanted to invite all of the Los Angeles Buffy supporters to check my Band YANK! at the Cat Club on April 11. The band includes John King, the Buffy and Angel music supervisor, and Aaron Miller former Buffy post production coor. The Cat Club is located at 8911 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood. We go on at 1130p. You can email me for a flyer to receive a discounted admission. Thank you for your continued support of the show!!!!!<br><br>

<dd>Question reguarding my position as script coordinator:  I love this job.  I love all the writers.  It's a fantastic opportunity because I'm an aspiring writer.  I don't take notes on set, as that is the job of the script supervisor.  I've actually been on Buffy since season 4.  I started out as the post p.a. for seasons 4 and 5.  Season 6 I was promoted to post coordinator and once again to post supervisor.  I was fortunate to move over to the pre-production side of things when David Goodman went on to write for Birds of Prey.  FYI - he currently writes for Fastlane.<br><br>

<dd>Hey everybody!!!!<br><br>Sorry I didn't get to answer everybody's questions yesterday.<br><br>In reference to questions about John King:  Music is submitted to him by Record labels and on occassion artists themselves.  The cool thing about John is that labels don't impress him.  He much rather use a local unsigned band than REM if their song is more appropriate for the show.<br><br>
