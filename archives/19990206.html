<DD>Hello the Bronze!<BR>
<BR>
This is me, with my behind sitting in the same chair as Tony!<BR>
<BR>
Woo hoo!<BR>
Tony has walked off, but he will hopefully be back soon.  If not, Sonja Marie says she'll print out the board to give him so that he'll see your questions.<BR>
<BR>
Hello to my buds!  I love my buds!<BR>
<BR>
Seth signed a card and drew a little picture for me.  He's so sweet!  And he's blond now.  Go figure.<BR>
<BR>
I met Elizabeth, who plays Amy, and she's very gracious as well.!<BR>
<BR>
ee you guys soon!<BR>
