<DD>Corvus - You can send it anytime.  I'm grateful for any pics I can get.  Sorry if I look wired in them.  That's because I was using tons of coffee in order to continue the forward movement and not keel over.  Thanks for taking them.  Sophia wanted me to remind people that "someone" spilled that wine on her at the PBP.  She normally doesn't walk around with big stains on her shirt.  <BR>
<BR>
I gotta go and get a hair cut now.  I understand that all the kids rave about this spikey-haired thing.  And you know I have to follow the trend like any other lemming.<BR>
<BR>
So take care people and please  remember to root for Adam, Riley, and all the Initiative Gang.  I predict that this summer everyone will be wearing army green!<BR>
<BR>
I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH SOME QUOTES I'VE HEARD ON THE SET:<BR>
<BR>
"I definitely think a woman kicking ass is extraordinarily sexy, alway" - Joss to Rolling Stone.<BR>
<BR>
"Okay.  Show me the fighty." - Joss to Jeff Pruitt.<BR>
<BR>
"I'm sooo f-in' knackered" - Sophia Crawford<BR>
<BR>
"You want me to what?  Oh $%#*!" - Angel stunt double Mike Massa to Jeff Pruitt during episode 20.<BR>
<BR>
"Jeff.  Eat this.  It'll help."- SMG to Pruitt after cutting a huge slice of cake and realizing that she really doesn't want to eat that stuff..<BR>
<BR>
"Okay.  That I don't want to do." - Mark Blucas after witnessing his stunt double Kevin Foster perform a painful gag and then lay very, very still for a moment.<BR>
<BR>
"It's impossible to do in the time we have.  How long do you think you'll need?  I can give you half of that."<BR>
- producer to Pruitt during episode 21<BR>
<BR>
"I don't get this.  What does this all mean?  Is the network going to allow this?"<BR>
- Jeff Pruitt to Joss' assistant during episode 22<BR>
<BR>
"We don't care.  hehe" - Joss assistant to Pruitt.<BR>
<BR>
See you guys later on,<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Aha!  Aynsley&Carmen - I knew it all along.  You and your anti-Buffy club will pay.  Oh how you'll pay.  I was only using trickery to bring you out into the open to be ridiculed by pros.  So there ... you .. uhm... you notgood uh ... dumb heads.  whew.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - we are wrapped.  please send all pics and money to the secret addy.

<DD>Deadgal - 10 No.  The script tells me what kind of fight to make.  That is whether it is serious or whatnot.  Then I choreograph it based on the tone of it and any details they want to see occur.  Also I work the action around whatever dialogue has to be put within the framework of the fight.<BR>
<BR>
2)Xander/Harmony was described as the "lamest fight in tv history."  The director wanted to shoot in slo-mo.  I just gave them some pads and told them to be careful and act girly.  It was a proud moment for everyone involved.<BR>
<BR>
3)  Sophia is my girlfriend and we've been working together for many years.  <BR>
<BR>
4)  One of our set dressers (Johnny Youngblood) is responsible for those things.  He tries to put crew names in graveyards and the like whenever possible.  He put me in the dorm.

<DD>Flora - Calista.  (yes I know it's you) I've told you that I'm out there supporting your show all I can.  So get off my "rump."  I can't help it that Sarah is more petite than you.  Eat something woman.<BR>
<BR>
spikey - I was just reading between the lines one day and I fell asleep.  I awoke with the thought that everything around me is evil and only I am good.  Then I looked in the mirror.  The horror.  So I watched the PBP tapes and started thinking of BLADE (the movie) and then I started thinking of hidden  groups who prey on the unwary, and then my mind wandered into Berkowitz country.  Thus the theory was born.<BR>
<BR>
Either that or my neighbor's dog told me.

<DD> OK Eiddileg.  No blue.<BR>
<BR>
From the start I have always thought that the PBP should be a "no-pants-allowed" affair.  Only people who work on the show get to wear pants.  All other attendees must abide by the no pants rule or risk ... well I have no idea what.  But it would be something creative I'm sure.<BR>
<BR>
You see, my other brilliant theory is that having no pants brings people closer together.  At least around my house it does.

<DD>Ron & Mike - I have an opinion on the whole PBP thing too.  I know it sounds  ... crazy at first... but please hear me out:<BR>
<BR>
Okay, this is what I've been pondering -<BR>
<BR>
The letters PBP represent the numbers 16, 2, and 16 respectively.  Add those up using numerology and you come up with the number 9.  (16 + 2 + 16 = 36 = 3 + 6 = 9)  The number nine also represents an upsidedown 6.  There are the three letters used to represent the Posting Board Party which relates obviously to 666.  Thus in my opinion the whole PBP itself is a representation of evil and should therefore be snuffed.<BR>
<BR>
So at the PBP 2001.  There will be stakings aplenty in  a direct imitation of a scene from BLADE.  (It is no mere coincidence that the PBP Prez calls himself by that name)  <BR>
<BR>
A huge diabolical plan to snuff out evil where it roots that has been three years in the planning will come to fruition in 2001.  It should be obvious!  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES IT!<BR>
<BR>
God.  You're all on it.  i see it clearly now ...

<DD> LilBufBuf: The gentlemen were tough they took 5 hours too, because they had hands it added some time. We have put that make-up up for this eason's Emmy contender. By the way, we won another award from our union. Best special make-up for a series for the roomate episode.

<DD> Angeloudi: I just do the show Buffy. Dayne Johnson and David De Leon do Angel. (I hired them, they do the show). <BR>
Anti- Emma hated the make-up process.She was a good sport but doesn't relish a repeat. This kind of make-up can be very uncomfortable and is not for everyone.
