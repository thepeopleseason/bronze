<dd>Christopher Marlowe - I do know a lot of good submarine movies.   Funny you should ask.  I'd have to say Das Boot is my favorite.  I love those German men.  Let me say that again, just to be clear: I love German men.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.<br><br>Wolfgod - you know what's happening in episode 13?  Crap.  This new system of keeping things a secret by posting script pages on the internet just isn't working out for us.  Maybe it's time to try something new.<br><br>Uh oh.  I have to go work for a little while.  Back in a bit.<br><br>

<dd>Okay, so since we know you've all been sitting around wondering what House each member of the writing staff would be in if he/she were to attend Hogwarts, we went ahead and compiled that data.  Just for you, our beloved fans:<br><br>Joss - Gryffindor<br>Jeff - Gryffindor<br>Fury - Hufflepuff<br>Ben - Ravenclaw<br>Liz - Ravenclaw<br>Sarah - Ravenclaw<br>Steve - Slytherin<br>Drew - Slytherin<br><br>At first, the Sorting Hat thought Steve might belong in Hufflepuff, but ultimately it decided on Slytherin for him.  And apparently I've got Malfoy lineage in me or something, because I didn't even get to sit down before I heard "Slytherin."  Which is fine with me - Gryffindor are a bunch of shinefaced wizards' pets.  I hope they rot.<br><br>

<dd>First of all, let me just rant for a second.  No new Angel until January?  What the hell are we paying you people for!<br><br>(Did you guys like the end of Destiny?  I thought that was pretty cool myself.  When I saw the first rough cut of that episode I jumped out of my seat and kissed Fury right on the mouth.)<br><br>
