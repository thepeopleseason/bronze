<DD>Well, I hate to post and run, but I'm in the middle of moving into my new place, and I have about 6 zillion things to do, plus we have rehearsal tonight.  Ack.<BR>
<BR>
Not to get too into it, but Jeff Stacy had to go to the hospital, and he was SUPER sick, and I passed out in the ER watching them do his spinal tap, and gave myself a concussion and several cuts on my scalp and ear, and it's been a nightmare.  Plus we had to move.  (Thank you to those who helped out!!  We couldn't have ever done it without you.)<BR>

<DD>Hi...it's been a dreadful past week or so, and I'm amazed I'm still ambulatory, but I thought I'd stop by, let you all know I'm alive, and that the KEY CLUB SHOW WILL ROCK!!!  =)<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and Happy Birthday, Anya!
