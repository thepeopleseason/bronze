<b>BellaDonna:</b>  Stunods?!?!?!?  LOL  You <i>are</i> Italian, aren't you?  *g*  Anyway, yes, they took 4 X-rays, actually.  And I sense SERIOUS liability on their part.  they kept saying over and over, "That why we ask the family to wait outside!"  And I'm all, "Um, nobody ever said anything to me!!!"<BR>
<b>WierdArchives:</b>  Um, if that was for me, Hi!  But I'm a Ms.  Not a Mr.  ;-)  (Go to my website, and you'll see, I'm definitely not a Mr.  hehehe)<BR>
<BR>
Bye, guys!  Lovely seeing you all.<BR>

<DD>Wrapping things up...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b> Actually, I haven't even met the crew yet.  Maybe they'll play jokes...I don't know!  eek!  Oh, and blood doesn't bother me!  I swear!!!!  Seeing his spine tapped like a maple tree was a bit unnerving, however...<BR>
Hiya, <b>CharlieX!</b><BR>
<b>FSMCDMan:</b>  I'm OK, thanks.  This all happened two weeks ago.  Before the big show, if you can believe it!  Didn't I see you on the freeway the other day???<BR>
<b>Occido:</b>  Hi!  Nice to see you!  I promise bo protect my head from now on, OK?  ;-)<BR>
<b>OkiLLByte:</b>  Well, if they maybe would GIVE me some clothes so I could help PROMOTE the line.....

<b>Basia:</b>  Heheheh...rock goddess, eh?  I like that.  =)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Actually, I'm usually pretty good with that stuff.  And it wasn't the needle that got me.  It's was watching the fluid fill up this tube, going against gravity, away from his spine.  I just started thinking too much about it.  Then I fainted.

<DD><b>Tish:</b>  No worries!  =)  My band is called Velvet Chain, and we were on the episode "Never Kill A Boy on the First Date."  Season 1.  They used two of our songs, ("Strong" and "Treason") and gave us good screen time.  =)  We have not been on any episodes since then, but we were the entertainment at the official cast/crew party at the end of seaon 2, and we also played at this years Posting Board fan party in LA, which many cast members attended, as well.  We're sort of the "unofficial Buffy band."  (That how David Boreanaz describes us, anyway.  Hehehe)  We have two CD's out.  The full length one (13 tracks) is called "Warm," and features a rockier version of "Strong" and the version of "Treason" as it appeared on the show.  There is also our latest release, "The Buffy E.P." which includes our very own Buffy theme song (not the Nerf Herder one, but a song all about Buffy.  It rocks.), and the original version of "Strong" as it appeared on the show.  There's a bunch of new tracks on there too.  It's a 6 song CD.  You can go to our webist, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a> and check us out!  (You can order merchandise there, too.)

<DD><b>TMorel:</b>  Thanks!  Yeah, I hear it's more common in children...  12, huh?  Yuck!<BR>
<b>BellaDonna:</b>  No blood test, but I'm fine, I assure you.  Didn't even catch a cold.<BR>
<b>AngelLover24/7:</b>  OK, I know you're just waiting to be asked this, so here goes:  What sort of shots are you getting?  An allergy thing?

<DD><b>Vaedus:</b>  Oh!  And you have e.<BR>
<b>BellaDonna:</b>  LOL..no-one slugged me.  I passed out.  Here's the basic story:  Jeff Stacy, our bass player came down with spinal meningitis, which we<BR>
didn't know at the time, but we rushed him to the ER, so they could test<BR>
him, etc.  They never asked me to leave the room, and while they were<BR>
giving him the SPINAL TAP, I passed out, from a standing position, and<BR>
hit my head VERY hard on that industrial hospital tile floor, plus cut<BR>
my head on a piece of hospital equipment.  (I also hadn't eaten in 24<BR>
hours, since I was busy taking care of Jeff, which contributed to my<BR>
dizziness and my subsequent unconsciousness.)<BR>
<BR>
That's the story.  My jaw's still messed up.  I hit the side of my head<BR>
at the temple on the hospital equipment thing, and it affected my<BR>
ability to open my mouth very wide.  Hurts to chew, that sort of thing.<BR>
<BR>
Jeff stayed in the hospital for 48 hours, and I stayed with him, and he's<BR>
OK now.<BR>
<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  Bonsoir!!!  Ça va comme çi, comme ça aujourd'hui...je suis tellement fatiguée!<BR>

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Cool.  I will look forward to receiving it!  =)  (Do you have Warm, Buffy, and a t-shirt??  Or just Buffy and the t?)<BR>
<b>AngelLover24/7:</b>  he had viral spinal meningitis.  They think.  Basically, he came up negative on every single test they gave him, so it was probably a virus that had crept into his spine via his sinuses/brain stem.  Nice, huh?<BR>
<b>Fax1:</b>  Great to see you!!!!  Sorry you can't stay.  I should get rolling soon, too.<BR>
RSO's to <b>Neophyte and Jeanie TIF!!</b>  Thanks for the noggin-sympathies...<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  No, actually.  This is a brand new director.  We don't know the crew.  Should be cool, though.<BR>
<b>Vaedus:</b>  Hehehe...do you have our CD's yet???<BR>
<b>Brat!:</b>LOL!  We're getting along OK.  I just tolerate her the best I can.  As for the boxes, I know what you mean, and I agree that you probably can get rid of that stuff now!  ;-)</SMALL>

<b>BellaDonna:</b>Ack!  I know.  AND, I had that cncussion just over a week ago.  This has definitely been one of the most difficult periods of my life, stress-wise.  But I really did have a great time at the show...and I did a pretty darn good job, too, I must say!!  ;-)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Corvus:</b>  Hi!  Well, things are going well.  We're upgrading our studio gear, so we're not recording right now. We'll start up again in a couple of weeks.  We will be filming a video for a brand new song ("Beyond Time"...those of you who've seen us live have heard it) in April, so that's exciting.  =)<BR>
<b>Angel Lover 24/7:</b>  yes, I did receive your e!  Thank you.  To stressed to respond, I'm afraid.  we're doing better, but Jeff still gets tired easily, and my jaw's still kinda messed up from the whack on my nogin.

<DD>JSK, you may have heard the Watcher's Guide was 100 pages longer in manuscript than the published version.  We had a little mini-yearbook in it, but it's been expanded to its own, original thing.

<DD>Oh, that's right!  *I* was drinking White Zin.  (Actually, it was Merlot.)  My best guess about a new Watcher's Guide would be to combine seasons 3 and 4 together, as we did 1 & 2 in the first one.  What do you think?
