<DD>Thanks Zed.<BR>
<BR>
I just popped back online because I was abruptly knocked off by my clogged computer.  I just didn't want to leave somebody hanging without answering.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I'll leave you guys to it.  I enjoyed talking at the Bronze again today.  <BR>
<BR>
Going for the food stuff now....<BR>
<BR>
take care,<BR>

<DD>Megdalen - Did you see that cool movie with Dark Angel in it?  She got to be a Cheerleader.  I think she was bionic or something.  It was pretty cool.  I was sorry that they felt they had to steal the cheers from those talented girls though.  Reminds me of stealing a character's on screen persona.

<DD>Longtimelurker - I hope this gets through.  I didn't mean to rudely  run off like that and not answer you.  I just had computer problems.  Maybe that's what happened to Sarah's Carl earlier when I was joking with him.  I sure hope he didn't think I was really calling him a dog.  Only andyourlittledogtoo is really a dog.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway,  like Leather said, Karen was the stunt double for Faith (she's doing WALKER: TEXAS RANGER now) and she and Sophia did that stunt you asked about four or five times.  They got hung up in the stair rails once.  Hurt every time they did it.

<DD>Safarigirl - No. Yuen Woo Ping choreographed and directed all the action for it.  It's a Chinese costume drama.  That means plenty of excuse for Kung Fu magic-style.  Lots of flying and fancy stuff.  But it'll fit that type of show.  It's really a love story directed by Ang Lee that has Woo's Martial arts fights contained in it.   Should be fun to watch.<BR>
<BR>
And no one in it even remotely looks like Faith from what I understand.    Though the word "Dark" is used a few times.  But only at night.

<DD>G.F. - No.  Don't think I've ever talked down to Carl even once.  I've always been straight with him.  I'd rather have someone treat me like I have some sense than to tip toe around me.  He should know that I'm always honest, and I'd never joke with someone I didn't like.<BR>
<BR>
I'm serious Glenn!<BR>
<BR>
On that note I will now withdraw my offer of the name "Carl" and replace it with "Kohoutek."  A more ominus sounding name.  Brings to mind a sense of Armegeddon approaching.  Just right for Sunnydale - which has about four a year of those.  (Armegeddon, I mean.  Not new doggies.  Heck, you understand me.  Don't look at me like you don't)<BR>

<DD>drdan - I'm not doing the 5th season (though I thank you very much for the kind compliments on the work)  and Sarah and I are not really even fueding in my mind.  I blurted out some things after I left and made a few heads spin around.  But I think I should be entitled to have a reaction when a knife goes in suddenly like that.  Other people do in real life.   And this one sure feels real to me.  But that's about it.  No harm done.  Some people want to blow it all out of proportion.  It's nothing but the typical thing.  People yell and that's it.  Done.  I've heard much worse things from other people who left the show.  So I guess I got off fairly easy.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, enough about that stuff.  You can email me if you have any question about me.  I'd rather just joke around here if I can and keep it all light-hearted.

<DD>G.F. - I wouldn't joke around with Sarah's Carl if I didn't like him.  He's cool.  I know he's in love with a poster, but that's okay.  He's entitled to that.  I had one of those Farrah posters back in the 70s and look how Farrah and I turned out...<BR>
<BR>
... wait a second.  Never mind.  We're both cool.  If I ever get a cute doggie I'll name him Carl.  Just to honor my friend Carl.

<DD>Ophelia - Please don't worry about that.  People disagree about things all the time.  Everyday you hear stories about this or that bratty actor.  They work.  The people they get mad at work later too.  Maybe the two of them don't want to work together anymore, but that's okay.  <BR>
<BR>
There's no  "fued" or anything on my part.  Everyone has a tale about some pain in the butt they've worked with and they sometimes even joke about it.  Don't worry about it too much.

<BR>
Sorry.  I was just reading some of my own fan mail there and got confused for a moment (yes - just for a moment) I'm okay now.  I'm sure that Peter O' Toole is a fine actor and also very professional.  And if his publicist says that he is very dead, then it must be true.  <BR>
<BR>
But I swear he's not.  I saw him just the other day doing horse stunts in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.  He so rocks.

<DD>Mrs. Pointy - Yeah.  Been having the fun-age (language I picked up on BUFFY. sorry)  Gotta project in the works and a comic too.  I guess I'm just following in Joss' footsteps there.  Though mine would never be as well-written, it would at least have the cool fighty fights.  Cool like you have not seen yet.  (He boasts softly)<BR>
<BR>
TMorel - I did get the pick.  I deserved it.  Yet somehow, I'm used to it.  People always kick me in the head.  But usually I get a check later on.  I'm still waiting for that one...

<DD>Sarah's Carl - yep.  Blame me for that one too.  The way I see it: Sarah has that little yapping dog.  Then the big fluffy one.  YOu could be her other pet.  I'm sure you'd volunteer for that duty.  Or at least we should start a letter writing attempt to get her to name her dog after you.  Wouldn't you just die if she named her next dog "Carl?"  That would be too freaky for even me.<BR>
<BR>
She'll probably name it "Knight" or something.  I already named a fungus I found in my toilet "Michelle" but we won't go there.  That's a level I just won't do.*  <BR>
<BR>
He said softly...<BR>

<BR>
newfan - Sophia is also doubling a famous actress soon in another show.  But she doesn't want me to say who just yet.  I'll let you know when it airs.<BR>

<DD>willows gimp - I'm not certified to teach JKD.  That was my room mate Tsyoshi Abe.  He is.  I don't have time to pursue any of that.  My focus is on the film side of things.  That's what I like doing.<BR>
<BR>
cymru lover - I come from a real fighting background.  So its easy for me.<BR>
<BR>
Everdawn - Bring girly pop and watch out for the sheep.<BR>
<BR>
chickquens - Yep.  Los Angeles.<BR>
<BR>
Meteor - In 6 to 8 months US SEALS 2 should be on HBO and/or video.  It's not a great script, but it does have some cool fighting in it.  And Sophia fights twice too.

<DD>shira - My Mom died of cancer during the prepping of the HUSH episode.  It was tough on me and caused a lot of stress inside.  So I know it can make everything harder on you.  <BR>
<BR>
I just come here because we all have the BUFFY/ANGEL thing in common and basically like a good sci-fi horror show now and then.  It's fun just to hang out and gab sometimes and it can take our minds off more serious matters too.  So just have fun here.  That's my advice.  Some people will give you a hard time, but they mean well.  Just use this place for fun and gossip about BUFFY stuff and forget about the world for a little while.  Hope that helps you a little.<BR>
<BR>
willow's gimp - I had a Japanese stunt girl doing all Willow's Martial arts.  Aly   really was not up to that level yet.  I'm sure she'd be the first to tell you too.  She's a big supporter of the stunt people.<BR>
<BR>
Kohoutek - All I ever did was try to figure out what Joss wanted for a scene and choreograph along those lines.  The actors had no input at all.  Though at times some of the guys would like to take some of the falls, I had to watch out for them.  It used to be Nick.  Then later it was Mark.  They just feel like trying to hit the ground, but they are surprised when they find out how much it can hurt them.  They have a lot of acting to do and can't walk around with a fat lip in close-ups.  That would get the stunt guys in hot water.  Most of them try to help us with what we have to accomplish in a single night.

<BR>
Kohoutek - Okay.  Is that Indian?  Eskimo?  What?  I know it must mean something.  Tell me.  NOW.  Okay... shouting doesn't work.  Please tell me.  I used to be a vip, y'know?<BR>
<BR>
Frodo - You can click on my email addy if you like.  It's all good in a hilarious sort of way though.  Don't fret Fro ;/<BR>
<BR>
Sophia just told me to click onto  channel 4.  She says Gena Lee Nolan's stunt double just did some stuff and now Gena is going to demo how she's been training at her "Martial arts" to do her new character on SHEENA.  God was that awful!  I'm sorry.  And I like her and the produceers, but YIKES.  That's no BUFFY.  We're so afraid that these lame-o chicks are gonna ruin it before we can get the good ones out there to show how it really should be done.<BR>
<BR>
At least CROUCHING TIGER will be good, I guess.  Thanks to Yuen Woo Ping's FULL control of the action.  Should be fun.

<DD>cymru lover & Krazy Kat -- I enjoy watching BUFFY/ANGEL as well as other shows.  Doesn't matter if I worked on it or not.  I am too critical of my own work though and that can get me in trouble sometimes.  I just want to do better and not settle for mediocre.<BR>
<BR>
I'm actually hoping that DARK ANGEL, CHARLIES ANGELS (and all other angels) aren't too bad.  Since this kind of action is what I've worked at perfecting, I know that bad shows can make execs say  with a singel sweeping gesture, "Oh.  Those fighting girl things are over now."  No.  Just the bad ones, boss.<BR>
<BR>
DeAn - Sophia did a great job on the movie and her injuries are all healed up now.<BR>
<BR>
belmont - That wasn't me.  I'm not blonde.  I was the hollow-eyed guy in the clock tower across the street.  You know.  The one holding the package of curtain rods.<BR>
<BR>
shira - It's okay.  I thought I was the one w/the official problems on this PB.  Can't I keep one little title for myself?<BR>
<BR>
WG - As the 3 Stooges used to say, "Hello, Hello, Hellooooo"<BR>
<BR>
TMorel - pass the pop please.  it's gonna be a bumpy flight.

<DD>Zeus - Somebody told me that someone had said on a Buffy group that I'd left stunts out of fear of the blacklist and went into Amway products.  I would do that if there is a potential for violence in it.  I guess there could be.  In the right neighborhood.  And if I wore my old Buffy Prom dress while going door-to-door.  <BR>
<BR>
Chris - Well.... I had a script called DARK NEXUS in '96 about a girl who is genetically altered who runs from a top secret facility.  I showed it only to some of Roger Corman's top guys. Unfortunately I heard they were fired and so I never followed up.   Next thing I know I hear that some of Corman's boys that left had created a new show for Cameron called DARK ANGEL.  Imitation?  Who knows? <BR>
<BR>
I heard that Joss wrote an excellent script about a guy who is cloned and has to confront an evil version of himself.  The studio supposedly wanted Van Damme to star in it, but the word I got was that Joss was against that particular idea and turned it down.  He wanted something else for his script.  Now guess who is editing a film he just shot about an evil clone?  Yep.  Mr. Van Damme.  It's called REPLICANT.  <BR>
<BR>
Who knows if any of this is related?  I have no idea.  Maybe they should give an award for best imitation without paying a writer.  Guess I'll wait and actually see these products when they come out and see how close they are to our own things.  What a funny, funny little business this is.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe Eliza can get residuals from DARK ANGEL.  Well... she could if it were not shot in Canada.  Too bad.  If DARK ANGEL tanks at least they can sell off the posters as Faith pictures ;)

<DD>cymru lover - I like it behind the camera.  But I've done some in the past.  Just because I was doing stunts and they said, "Here.  You say this now."  The only time I ever had to audition for any acting part  was when I played that character on Deep Space Nine.<BR>
<BR>
shira - Don't worry.  Just roll with it.  DO IT NOW.  oops sorry again.  I'm too wacky for my own good.  I have to continually apologize for that.  It's the Slim Shady in me.<BR>

<DD>willow's gimp - Wow.  Did you actually recognize a few JKD-style moves on BUFFY?  <BR>
<BR>
When I lived with the Asian stunt guys one of our roomies was an instructor at Dan Inosanto's place.  <BR>
<BR>
Hello Dr. Lectre.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway ... about the stunt business.  Everybody knows how hard I've tried to give credit to them.  Sophia did every single fight and stunt on BUFFY till the end of 4th season.  If Buffy moved - it was Sophia.  That's how you can tell.  The character actually makes a fast movement.<BR>
<BR>
The close shots were usually on Sarah.  I say usually, because often even that was Sophia.  <BR>
<BR>
Sarah is a great actress.  Just not an athlete.  And (despite what she says in her publicity) she was not a real Martial artist before BUFFY.  That simply is not true.  <BR>
<BR>
She is a little ticked off over some new blonde from BRING IT ON that is doing some fights on the show now as a new character.  (No.  Not Dawn)  So she's sort of been making a fool of herself recently by trying to do as many shots as the new girl does.  But that'll all get worked out in editing with the two new Buffy stunt doubles.  They've had three  or four so far for different things this season.  It'll be cool.<BR>
<BR>
(*And no ... I'm not going into any details about any scripts either.  Even though I'm not on the show anymore, I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  Or hurt the hard work the writers are doing.)
