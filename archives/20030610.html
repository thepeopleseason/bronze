<dd>ACK!  My internet connection is being really weird today (I'm on Adelphia cable), and my last post just got totally eaten!!  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...  And it was long!<br><br>OK, I'll try again, but I may have to sign off soon, as my frustration level is building mightily!!<br><br><b>Dust'em:</b>  The CD is coming along great!  Recording has slowed down a bit due to all the projects I've been doing and the fact that Jeff keeps getting inspired and writing new songs, but we really will release it soon!  It's about 80% done.  =)<br><b>faithx5:</b>  The film is called "A Couple of Days and Nights," and I am one of the four leads.  My love interest, "Micah," is played by David Lago ("Raul" on <i>The Young and the Restless</i>), and my roommate, "Rhonda," is played by Shonda Farr (who was the robot in the BtVS ep <i>I Was Made To Love You</i>, among other things).  My character is named "Jula," and I am a complete wack-job.  David and I play the comic characters, and Shonda and Joe (a friend of mine who is playing "Scott," the other lead), play the more normal, "heroic" characters.  I had a blast!  I love playing the wacky characters...I find being the romantic lead kind of boring.  Anyway, we're hoping to have the film done in time to get it into Sundance.  If it does well there and at other festivals, maybe we'll luck out and get it distributed, so you can see it a theater near you!  Keep good thoughts!  =)<br><b>abt:</b>  I beat Ben Stein on the show <i>Win Ben Stein's Money</i>, so I won $5,000.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Major Wiggins:</b>  hehehe...  Small world, eh?  Yeah, I went down there on Saturday to sing in their "Starlight on Stage Gala" (drove straight from the movie set, 3 hours each way, what a nightmare, but I'd committed to performing before I knew that I'd be shooting all weekend), and everyone seemed really nice!  =)<br><b>Cosmic Bob</b>:  Hey!  I know, I know...  but I did sleep quite a bit yesterday.  I got home from the set at 3am, and I didn't wake up til 11am.  Then I took a nap in the afternoon.  So, today, I'm still resting, but I'm also trying to get a few things done around the house, you know?  =)<br><b>abt:</b>  Yep.  I've already been on one, which I totally won (yay!), but this next appearance will be on Jeopardy, (airing July 10th), and I very much did NOT win.  Yuck!  Oh, well.<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>eirefairie!</b>  How goes it?  =)  I am exhausted!  I just finished principal photography for the indie feature I was doing, and the last day was just <i>insane!</i>  Long story short, I was on set, in every single scene, for 17 and a half hours!  Ack!  So, I'm pretty much being a vegetable today.  ;-)  How are you?<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys! I just stoppped by to check in, and saw <b>Little Willow</b> plugging <b>Fiddler</b> at Starlight!  hehehe  Thanks, LW!<br><br><b>Major Wiggins:</b>  Yes, they do, but I hear it's not as frequent as in years past, due to a vastly improved sound system.  So, now they only pause during dialogue, not musical numbers.  I'll know more when I get down thereon the 23rd!  =)<br><br>
