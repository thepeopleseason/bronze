<dd>Gday to the masterful Rob Kral!  <br><br>I'd love to write back specific posts to each and every one of you like the good old days when I was actually witty, but I'm about to keel over.  So a big whompin' "thank you" for watching my little show.  Had tons of help from the massively talented cast and crew.  Kudos and big salty tears of thanks.<br><br>For those of you who are still confused, much will be explained next week.  But not all, 'cause hey -- gotta keep you guessing.<br><br>

<dd>GDAY STEVE!!! Congrats on a <br>superb episode tonight. (Hey, <br>DeKnight's posting now, does <br>that mean I can post more than <br>4 times per hour?)<br><br>I was gonna fly, but had to say Hi <br>to Steve DeKnight!<br><br>Ducky: it wasn't directed at you! <br>Just the Miraclesless poll <br>posters!<br><br>Okay gotta go.<br><br>

<dd>Tenik (re: sweetslayer's typing!!!)<br>It's probable not that, meaning, I <br>don't think sweetslayer is <br>necessarily hitting enter that <br>often. I mean look how my posts <br>come out, all skinny et. Look <br>how Joss's posts used to come <br>out, all skinny etc. <br><br>It's probably, <br>well in my case at least (and it <br>used to be in Joss's case) <br>because I am using Internet <br>Explorer. If I used Netscape it <br>wouldn't happen.<br>For example, I will let you know <br>when I hit ENTER, until then I'll <br>hit <br>x...xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxENTER<br>xxxxxxx<br>get it?<br>OKAY, nuff bandwidth from me. I <br>have 15 minutes of Angel music <br>to write by FRIDAY noon, so I <br>beter get cracking!!<br><br>

<dd>Whilst I do find the spoilers for <br>tonight's Angel fun, and delight <br>in your delight of DeKnight's <br>episode....<br><br>...the TV viewer's poll for Monday <br>Night is thus far sadly "Miracles" <br>lacking.<br><br>Shame on you !!<br><br>whitewings: thanks! Yeah, I told <br>you so!! :)<br><br>faithxFive thanks too!<br><br>LenS: Yes it was. And boy did I <br>LOVE bringing back  (spoiler <br>follows) Darla's theme. <br>My face lit up like a Christmas <br>tree when I first saw her on this <br>episode (I was SO <br>surprized!)<br><br>
