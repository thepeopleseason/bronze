<dd><B>faithx5:</b>  Not sure...  It's looking like just the trailer, (and that's not 100% yet), but if they flip over the song we just recorded for them, who knows??  Keep your fingers crossed!<br><b>miremba:</b>  Hi there!  Cool!  Well, there are no VC shows, but if you're interested in coming to see me in SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, that's still running.  We have shows Fri and Sat at 8pm and Sun at 3pm.  That weekend (May 17, 18, 19) is the last weekend I'll be doing the show for sure.  After that, things get crazy with the film I'm doing and stuff...  So my understudy will probably be taking over for a lot of the performances after the 19th.<br><br>

<dd><b>The Sleeper Wakes</b>  Hey! That's great!  I have important info for you, then!  (I'll just copy the last e-mail I sent out about it here for ya):<br><br>Hello!<br><br>OK, here's a GREAT deal for you: West Coast Ensemble is offering tickets to "Sunday in the Park with George" at a special 2-for-1 deal for this coming weekend!!!  That's right, this deal is good for all three performances: Fri, Sat, and Sun, May 9-11!  So, instead of the regular $35 ticket cost, you bring a buddy and it's only $17.50! Good deal, right? =)<br><br>All you have to do is call and make reservations in advance, stating that you're reserving two seats for whichever performance you choose at the special 2-for-1 price. The number for reservations is (323) 525-0022  Be sure to have your credit card number ready.  (And remember:  this deal is only good for you and a friend.  It's a true 2-for-1 deal, not 1/2 price.)<br><br>Again, to be clear, the 2-for-1 deal is good for this coming weekend ONLY. That's May 9th, 10th, & 11th. =)  Also, this will be the LAST weekend in which there will be NO understudies!  So, if you want to come see this amazing cast in its entirely intact state, come NOW!<br><br>This is a really amazing deal, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!<br><br>See you at the theater!  ;-)<br><br>~Erika<br><br>West Coast Ensemble is located at 522 N. La Brea Ave., Hollywood, CA 90036<br><br>

<dd>Bye, <b>littlexander!</b><br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe, OldManFan, slayerdaddy:</b> Well, here's the short version:  I just got cast (AEA Guest Artist contract) as "Hodel" in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF down in San Diego.  I'll start rehearsing for that in late June.  I'm starring in an indie feature with David Lago of <i>The Young and the Restless</i> and Shonda Farr  (of the BtVS episode, <i>I Was Made To Love You</i>) and we start shooting that on May 19th.  I'm still doing SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, as well.  (Of course I'll have to miss a few performances due to the filming.)  Velvet Chain has a gig on Thursday, and we're finishing up the new album, (slowly but surely), and we got hired by Fox Searchlight to record another French song (they already like "Oui, Je L'Adore") for the trailer for "Le Divorce."  Busy, busy...  OH!  And I just finished up a 6-week voice-over course at Kalmenson & Kalmenson in Burbank, which was very cool.  And I have a meeting with a big talent agency on Thursday (I already auditioned for them and they're interested in representing me), too.  I think that's it...<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys!  I know I haven't been around in a while, but I've been so ridiculously busy, it's really kind of absurd.  ;-)  I have a few minutes before I have to run out again, though, so I thought I'd stop by and say hi!  <b>HI!</b><br><br>
