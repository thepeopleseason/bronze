<dd><b>Mr. Holtz:</b>  LOL!  It's not that I don't know how to spell your name, it's that I never check my typing, and I'm just HORRIBLE!<br><br><b>Everybody:</b>  Thanks for the sympathy and the good-luck vibes!  I've got to run.  Please spread the word about the re-registering thing, OK?  Thanks!<br><br>~Erika<br><br>

<dd><b>Aramina:</b>  No worries.  NA is not a sate.  We'll figure it out!  =)<br><b>My Holtz:</b>  Yes, we have, undisputedly, the absolute <i>worst</i> computer-karma I have ever heard of.  Things happen to us that technicians have never seen before.  It's just lovely. ;-)<br><b>Old One:</b>  It's for a production of Smokey Joe's Cafe (basically a revue of 50's and 60's tunes by Lieber and Stoller) in Austin, TX.  Not sure if I'll take it even if I get it, but hey - might as well audition, right?  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Major Wiggins:</b>  As I said, we had backups as recent as July 21st. (We crashed on August 10th, and it's taken us this long to get back up and running.)  Unfortunately, they were no good.  I don't really know why, I just know they were useless and Jeff wanted to shoot the d@mn thing.  ;-)  We had to buy a whole new computer.  The last uncorrupted backup we had was from April.  So there ya go.  (At least we have everything from  Sept. 1998 through April, 2002!)<br><br>

<dd><b>Aramina:</b>  Thank you!  FYI, you can just put in two x's for the state if it does that.  XX.  Tell your British friends!  ;-)  I'm singing at an audition.  In about an hour.  So, I should go pretty soon...<br><br>

<dd><b>Mr. Hotlz:</b>  Well, FWIW, we did have backups.  Recent backups.  We're very good about it.  But our crash was beyond the norm, and I guess the computer had been evil for a while, so our backups were corrupted, too, and we basically got screwed.  *sigh*  We had to buy a whole new system and start from scratch.  The last <i>uncorrupted</i> backup we had was from April.  hence the loss of 4 months of data.  =(<br><b>Prophet 6:</b>  Been great, thanks.  Computer issues aside, of course.  And Jeff's very busy working on the new CD, which should be out in November!<br><br>

<dd><b>HELP!</b><br><br>Hi, guys - <br><br>I don't know if you heard about this already, but <b>Velvet Chain</b> suffered a HUGE computer meltdown, and to make a long, painful story short, we've lost everything in our band's mailing list/database that was inputted after April13th, 2002.  Basically, if you registered with us at any time between April 13, 2002 and August 13th 2002, we lost you, and we need all your info again. (I.E., if we met you at CreepCon, or a gig, or you submitted your registration online at any time bewteen those dates, you've disappeared to us!) So, if that applies to you, just go to http://www.velvetchain.com to re-register. We'd be very appreciative! <br><br>And if you could spread the word about this, I would be really, really grateful! To have lost 4 solid months of contacts is just unbelievably depressing. *sigh* <br><br>Thanks! <br><br>~Erika<br><a href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank">www.velvetchain.com</a><br><br>
