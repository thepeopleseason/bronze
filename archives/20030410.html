That's an easy one:<br><br>Knock knock knock.  "Miss Jameson, I'm here to clean your pool..."  Cue the music.  <br><br><br>C Marlowe:  Finishing it now.

<dd>Cassie:  Working hard, that's my life.  And I love it, of course.  Just finishing up my Disney script so I can hand it over to the mouse.  Look for it in theaters around 2005.  Give or take a forever.<br><br>DaddyCatALSO:  As a UCLA Prof once said to me:  Write on!  (Yeah, kinda corny, but well meaning corn.)<br><br>Goddess@Home:  Yeah, the cleaver was mine.  Started as a butcher's knife, but then I switched to something with more menace.  The chainsaw was just too much, however.<br><br>Eirefaerie:  Tim cool, smoking not.   This message brought to you by your lungs, mamma!<br><br><br>One more round, then this bird's gotta fly.<br><br>

Let me sleep on them - uh, it.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  We love to diddle. <br><br>Kessie:  Keep everything crossed.  We're gonna need it.<br><br>Allyson:  I hear you.  Now don't make me come over there and hug you.<br><br>

<dd>LittleXander:  All of it was planned since 85.   No, wait, I'm sorry.  I meant 86.<br><br>Newt:  What?  I thought you guys loved the Cordy/Connor bump'n'grinder?<br><br>Tralf:  Thanks baby.  You must be one twisted lady.  Sweet!<br><br>Toni:  The who what where?  Ah, what the hell.  Pour me a drink and I'm there.<br><br>Tiggy:  Thanks!  No news yet on our fate.  We probably won't know until mid-May.  Grrr.  Arghh.<br><br>

Don't kill me!)<br><br>HumVee:  Angel finale has been written by Tim Minear and is being directed by the man as we speak.<br><br>
