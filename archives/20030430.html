<dd>Lionhunter: Believe me, please, when I say that being a part of this show has been one of the greatest joys I've EVER had.  So right back atcha.<br><br>Xanderella: Thanks for the nice thoughts.  Clearly, you have excellent taste.<br><br>AngelBabyDTM: Thanks for the praise.  But bad, bad AngelBaby for being spoiled!!  Don't you know about the kissing reward you get for remaining spoiler-free??!  I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that Drew Goddard has been practicing to hand out the reward when the time comes, and kids?  I don't want to say who he's been practicing ON, but, um... he's gotten REALLY good.<br><br>Okay, seriously, you guys aren't gonna brawl?  Man, I'm gonna have to start making up stories now about what you guys are saying about each other... Hey, Tiggy!  C'mere, did you hear what OldManFan was totally saying about you...?<br><br>

<dd>Angel101: Yay!  We made you cry!!  Don't worry, there won't be much to cry about in the next few eps. Except that I am totally lying.<br><br>Ducky: Never come to your house?  What do you mean?  I'm there all the time... well, all the times you're not home, I mean.  (Mmmm...Cheez-its and Scrabble... I think you just described Jane's Perfect Party Night... and also maybe mine...)<br><br>Jerry: Thanks.  Yeah, the cops were being controlled by the increasingly disruptive force of the hellmouth.  Hope that helps.<br><br>OldManFan: Thanks.  I'm looking forward to being caught on the Succubus Club, too.  <br><br>Kenicke: But what do I do about all these darn butterflies I've put up all over my bedroom to make it look just like Mariah's episode of Cribs??!?<br><br>

<dd>Hey, KAM, thanks.<br><br>Tiggy: Glad you enjoyed the ep, and glad you're asking all the right questions.  Not that I'm answering them, but glad you asked.<br><br>Kessie: I totally agree.  I LIKE the debate, I LIKE knowing people are taking sides about something I wrote.  I LIKE dividing people, stirring things up... it's why I start rumors about the other writers behind their backs, like when I told Rebecca that Drew Goddard said she had funny hair... oh, wait.  I shouldn't have said that.  Never mind.<br><br>

<dd>Thanks for the love, guys.<br><br>eire: A song??  For me??  By Mariah or Bette?  I think the other divas will get jealous, we should probably let them have a crack at it, too.<br><br>Safari: Glad you liked that scene.  I liked it, too.  No one cries like Ally.<br><br>tralf: You rock!  You know, I think it's time for a Drew Z. New-and-Improved-Been-to-the-Gym-a-Few-Times Bitty, don't you??  (Hint, hint...!)<br><br>Hey, Soph: Life as a soon-to-be-former Buffy writer is still very nice, though a bit lonelier these days without the other Loony Tune Writers to keep me company-slash-hide marital aides in my desk drawers.  But I'm holding up okay, I think.<br><br>Princess: Heya!  Steve's FAR too busy to talk to me, but I try to hang out outside his bedroom window at least three nights a week, I'll see what I can do to mention you.<br><br>

<dd>I'm gonna take a page out of the Steve DeKnight Handbook (no, not the chapter on Proper Ear Wax Removal, the other part) and actively not engage in a debate about my work.  Either you liked it or you didn't, and I'm glad to see there's a healthy representation of both sides here.  I will say that we felt we had planted the seeds for this development (quite well) earlier in the season and that Buffy's attitude has been growing increasingly and visibly in this direction for some time, most notably showing itself first in CWDP.  You may not agree.  That's your right.  I mean, you'd be wrong, but it's your right.  Ha, ha, I kid.  There is no right and wrong.  Just Drew's Way and Everything Else.  Oh, look, there I go again.  Kidding again.  Mostly.<br><br>That said, I also don't feel that thoughtful, respectful debates use words like "unemployed" and "crapfest."  However, I'd be thrilled if y'all wanted to start brawling over the whole thing, I've never started a bar fight before, this could my chance!!!  <br><br>Now, let's play nice, kids.<br><br>
