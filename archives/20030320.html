<dd>hey gang.<br><br>have to say i loved <b>Comteacher</b>'s post a few boards back, regarding "Angel" getting pre-empted for news coverage.  i will always remember that someone -- somewhere -- in giant bold font -- actually wrote the words, "No!!!! No war is more important than ending this episode!"  my life is complete.<br><br>also, my new favorite expletive, uttered by someone else who got bumped: "Oh holy mother of crap."<br><br>glad most of y'all liked "Orpheus" -- with the exception of the guy who wrote, "the scenes just weren't any good."  darn it -- and i am always trying to make those scenes good, too.  it's like my whole "thing", y'know?  ah, well.  back to phone-wenching at Domino's... love me a good, thick polyblend.<br><br>thanks in particular to <b>Kiba Rika, eirefaire</b> [<small>how the #*%&@ do you spell that again?</small>], <b>whitewings</b>, and, as always <b>tralf tralf tralf</b>.  <br><br>and Holy mother of crap -- was that <b>KarenT</b> i saw drive by?<br><br><small>"Good.  Good...  bells."</small><br>-mere-<br>sigJTT<br><br>

<dd>Wolfguard, evening.<br><br>OzLady . . . so fresh!  Keep it up and I'll tell everyone what your next birthday's going to be.  ;)  Glad you liked the excerpt.  That book is loads of fun.  And Polgara and Little Sister get horribly killed.  Oh, and Claris is a naked, Amazonian lesbian sorceress.  I'll bet some people think I'm kidding.<br><br>Mocha, thanks.  You might like to know I just did a deal for two more Body of Evidence books.<br><br>
