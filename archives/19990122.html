<DD><b>CharlieX:</b>  I knew a lot of you would know, but I felt like heading off the question at the pass, so to speak.  =)  I love vinyl.  Still have my old records, and a turntable (Well, three, including the two we use in the band.)

<DD><b>Sachiel:</b>  It's going to be such a cool album.  It will have the original version of Strong on it.  (The version they used on NKABOTFD), plus "Lovin' Ain't So Easy" from Groovy Side, plus the Buffy song, plus a brand-new song whose lyrics were cowritten by a Bronzer!!!, plus two more new tracks....  Oh, it'll be $10.  And there's more, but I don't want to give everything away just yet.  *g*

<DD>OK, I have news for ya!<BR>
<BR>
WE will be releasing a brand new CD, entitled "The Buffy EP."  (EP stands for extended play, a term left over from the days of vinyl, meaning it'll have more than two songs, but fewer than a full album.  In our case, it'll be 6 songs.)  And, YES, the "Buffy song" will be on it!  And YES< we plan on having it for sale at the PBP!  That's the plan!  That's why I'm so busy!  Ack.

<DD><b>Corvus:</b>  Just one set, but an extra-long, super-special one.  Like, over an hour long.  =)  Yes, I will join, but only after I've performed.  (Don't want to strain the old vocal chords beforehand...)<BR>
<b>KrazyKat:</b>  Hi!  I'm OK.  Wrong comp for accents, and too frazzled to speak effectively in French, I'm afraid.  How are you?

<DD><i>RD saunters into the bronze and sees -mere- curled up in a corner booth with a chenille throw. a spoon in her hand trying to scoop one of the little marshmallows out of the hot chocolate on the table in front over.  RD passes Raksasha with a tall, well built, sweedish guy in tow and says "see it really isn't about size".  RD pushes his way through the onlookers barking "move along now, nothing to see here"...  he slides into the corner booth. lights a lavender scented candle... snuggles up close, very close to -mere-, gives her a smooch and takes the spoon from her, saying, "here let me get that for you sweetie".  RD feeds -mere- the marshmallow and she gives him a hug as the lights dim , music goes up and in the background a lovely voice sings "...in the arms of an angel..."
