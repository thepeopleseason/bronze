<dd>Oops!  I didn't realize what time it was...gotta go in a sec!<br><br><b>Daps:</b>  Well, thank you so much!  =)<br><b>Old Man Fan:</b>  Hey!  I'll be at the PBP, so I hope to see you there.  We're not performing right now (still working on the new album and band-business-deals and stuff), but I am in a musical right now that rehearses 6 days a week...  I'm hoping to make it to the Bronzer Breakfast, as well, so maybe I'll see you there?<br><B>Ansky47</b>  Hey!  That's great to hear!  I'm so glad you like it.  =)<br><b>Dust'Em:</b>  Yep, I'll be there again...I don't know why people had such a hard time finding me last year!  Maybe I'll hang out by our VC table more and dance less...  hehehe  Anyway, hope to see you there!<br><b>Corvus:</b>  Oh, thank you...I hope so too.  <i>*sigh*</i><br><br>

<dd>Again, to be clear: we have <I>chosen</i> to not sign any distribution deals at this time, but thank you for the good wishes, anyway!  (Let's put them towards this label deal we're working on, intead, OK?)  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>nosce_teipsum</b>  Well, we've had distribution in the past, and without going into any detail, we've gotten MAJORLY screwed a couple of times, (As in, we're owed thousands of dollars and we just can't get any justice), so we're happy just selling our stuff ourselves for now.  (FYI, Blockbuster is EVIL!)<br><b>HumVee:</b>  As alluded to in my above post, we have had distribution in the past, but it just hasn't worked out.  (Both "Warm" and "The Buffy EP" were available in stores.)  Our two most recent releases, "Moody Groove Music" and "Velvet Chain Live at the Temple Bar" were both released exclusively over the internet, from our own site.  If your debit card has a visa symbol on it or whatever, that'll work just fine!  If not, and you'd still like to order, we accept international money orders, as well.  (Just click on "mail order" on our store ordering page.)<br><br>

<dd><b>fiathx5:</b>  Yep, that's right.  You're not making it up.  We have label interest, but it's all still nebulous, so I can't gie you a precise release date.  If I had to guess, I'd say sometime this summer.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>DeAn:</b>  Oooooh!  I love choclately goodness!  And I just love gifts, period.  hehehehe  So, if you feel like bringing me something, I will be happy to accept!  ;-)  As for the album, we're still negotiating with this new label that wants to release it, so that's why it's been on hold for a bit.  I promise we'll let you all know as soon as it comes out!<br><br>

<dd><b>HumVee:</b>  We have plenty of albums in stock; we just don't have distribution!  So, we sell everything ourselves.  Just go to our secure site, <a href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank">www.velvetchain.com</a> and order what you like from there.  We have 4 albums for sale there, besides various special releases, like "Velvet Chain Greatest Hits" _ which is a hilarious name, but we really just mean our most popular songs - which is a great way to get started on the band, if you don't have any of our records yet.  =)  We send to the UK all the time.  We accept Visa, Mastercard, and Amercian Express.  Hope that helps!<br><br>

<dd>Oh!  I wanted to tell you guys:  I just found out on Friday that I am going to be a contestant on <b>Jeopardy!</b>  I took the test back in August, (I passed), and they finally called me on Friday to come down and do the show.  I am so freaked out!  I have no idea how I'm going to do, and I am not into studying, but I guess I should at least play some Trivial Pursuit games or something to try and get on the ball.  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you guys so you could send GOOD VIBES my way on March 5th, when I'll be taping the show.  EEK!!!<br><br>
