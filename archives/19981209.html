<DD>"shrug". Also, i would like to apologize for casting Alyson Hannigan as willow.  If I had known how dull and limited she was, and how drab she looked in leather, I would never have chosen her.  Well, time to scan episodes of Charmed to look for ideas to steal.  Then maybe i'll bring the new Grisham to bed with me.  <BR>
<BR>
I have lots more to say so I'm going to keep posting all night.<BR>

<DD>First of all, i just want to say I'm sorry.  This week's episode was unduly violent and quite frankly dull.  The several hundred hours I have spent watching the quality religious programming on channel 40 has shown me that now.  Also, someone mentioned that the show has developed a feminist subtext.  Well, I never!  I just wanted to show a quiet, obedient girl learning to attract men through cosmetics and physical weakness.  (Probably a mistake to cast the off-puttingly plain miss Gellar, in that case.)  But sometimes we can't control our own creations.  For give me.  I think I need to take some time to reassess.  We need quality programming like THAT 70's SHOW and shows with the Olsen twins -- gosh I wish they could have been quintuplets!  Well, that's all for now.  Time for my Tony Robbins tapes.<BR>

<DD><BR>
loki - I rarely begin work on an episode until after I've seen the final cut.  For that matter, I rarely begin work on an episode until a few days before it's due.<BR>
<BR>
Natalie, Shadowslayer - thanks<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - cool.<BR>
<BR>
Blackheart - I do work best under pressure, which is part of the reason I tend to procrastinate so much.

Arymede - hi<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - Oh, OK.  I told you.  Fer sez "Feeling silly Chris?"<BR>
<BR>
Goddess Minerva, 1buffyfan, curlysue, darklady, bec, a polite newbie- thanks<BR>
<BR>
pixie - It was a real vocal, sung by Bobbi Page, a studio singer here in L.A.  (Bobbi rox)<BR>
<BR>
1buffyfan - no score soundtrack plans as of yet, but I'm working on it.  (Song album supposedly out soon).

<DD>Hey, Fer Bos just showed up.  He's the music editor (and a darn good one at that).  Fer sez: "Hi everybody."<BR>
<BR>
WinterRain - Thanks, and coming here is my pleasure.  I get excited too.<BR>
<BR>
horizon - normally things are not quite this last-minute.  I do get the episode only after it's finished being edited, since the music is timed very tightly to the picture.  But usually my delivery deadline is a few weeks before air.  I'm not privy to the vagaries of post-production scheduling, so I don't know why "Amends", and "The Wish", for that matter, were scheduled for such a late final mix (the Thursday before air).  Oh, and also, I had a bit of a tough time with a HUGE and LONG music-intensive big last scene.  I only got it approved by Joss this afternoon on my second try.<BR>
<BR>
raptamama, Angle Man, loki - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
missi - I scrolled & saw it... Good job CBCCers, though again in vain.  How many times till we give up?  It's been two tries.  Maybe three strikes and yer out.  <BR>
<BR>
noni - thanks.  vaca coming at xmas.  Mmmm.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus- there's a fair amount of christmassy music in Amends, though most of it what we call "source music" (the music that the characters can actually hear.  Like a Christmas carol playing over speakers at a mall or something...)  And I get my best ideas from my dog Joey.  He whispers to me as I  sleep.  ("Pseudo-classical alto solo... pseudo-classical alto solo...")</SMALL>

<DD>If anyone knows how I can make my name appear as anything other than "Chris Beck (composer)" please clue me in.  (I want to post as bizzarro-Chris.)  (Or I may want to post as "Chris Beck (cupcake)".  Anybody?)<BR>
<BR>
Heya and thanks (variously) to Dianne, Sodapop, Cirrus, Avarice, Pixie, and CharlieX.<BR>
<BR>
Goldengirl - well, I'll just have to try harder next time.<BR>
<BR>
Jennifer Lynn, you is 100% genius.<BR>
<BR>
fax1- if you're still around - where in the heck did you hear I was delivering the xmas score tomorrow?  (Not that it's entirely untrue...)</SMALL>

<DD> Yippie!  For the liking of the episode.  Thanks, all.  And yes, all the actors loved getting a chance to step out of their normal roles.  It was a blast for all of them and us.  Unfortunately, I gotta run.  It was great to check in.  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>Hey all.  Just checking the posts and excited to see how many of ya'll enjoyed last night's show.  Have to say - can't believe we got some of that on the air.  Keep thinking of some seven-year-old turning to his/her parent and saying - "Mommy?  Why is Willow on top of Angel?  And why is she licking him?"  Anyhoo.  We all had a hell of a lot of fun on epi nine.  Wait till next week, our sick and twisted Xmas Ep.  Joss did an incredible job.  I was and am in awe.  <BR>
<BR>
Hope ya'll are well.  PS - sorry I couldn't take that IM.  I was on the phone at the time.  Nothing personal.
