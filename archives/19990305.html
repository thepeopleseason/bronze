Hey Cate, thanks<BR>

RJ - No ya didn't  *grrrr back*<BR>
<BR>
'night Sarah W. - sleep well<BR>
<BR>
BATS396 - I'll add it to the list<BR>
<BR>
LW - But, but, you're gonna run out of room.  You know that.  You can't put em <i>all</i> there... *terrified look* can you?<BR>

<DD><BR>
CHRIS - umm, no... goodies gone already.  But that's OK, cuz said goodies are actually baddies for my health... trying to lose them pounds ya know.  But mm mm mm good.<BR>
<BR>
Dark Slayer - well, currently I have XTC on infinite repeat in my car... they're certainly up there.  And re: your question - it's possible but unlikely that SMG would personally respond to your letter.  She probably gets (literally) a ton of mail.  But you might get lucky, and you've got nothing to lose, so why not send it?<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - re: addams family - lol.  I have a few very different ideas so far, but they all have one thing in common, a hauntingly beatiful melody.  Or at least I'm trying.<BR>
<BR>
melanie, Sarah W, Brio - skittles, I used to be addicted to them.  Still love them from time to time.  Melanie doesn't know what she's talking about.  mmmm Skittles.<BR>
<BR>
Night Owl - but acing *has* occured.  Your logic is infallible... procrastination = acing, I see your post there, therefore you = acing.<BR>
<BR>
heya WinterRain, FSM CD Man.  Who's Mark Krisky?  What cameo was I not involved in?<BR>
<BR>
Slayee - You're right, someone's gotta provide pizzas, both literal and aural.<BR>
<BR>
To anyone worried that Angel will keep me too busy to procrastinate:  oh how little ye know me.<BR>
<BR>
Syd - see below, I hate it here.<BR>
<BR>
SealedNFate - Again, I'm not sure about the direction for Angel, but darker is a good bet.  I've also been told the show will be more anthologic (hmm?) than Buffy - the eps will be a little more self-contained, so there may not be as much call for season-spanning themes.  But who knows?  Certainly not moi.

(long post, sorry)<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - Thanks, and rest assured - it *is* way too much for me.  I wouldn't want it any other way.<BR>
<BR>
weeping willow - I think Danny Elfman is fine, but I'd have to ask him   :)<BR>
<BR>
tictac - I know.  hehehehehe<BR>
<BR>
Arctic Lurker - can't wait myself either.  I should emphasize that at this point I have not been offered the theme per se - only the first crack at it.  If my ideas don't fly they may look elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
Wax - laffing laffing at the phunny accent<BR>
<BR>
Lil Wil, Angle Man, night Owl - Ooh, Flurry of Hope, A Second Chance, Angel's Dust... not bad.  Good, in fact.  Wow, you guys kick the newsgroup's arse.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, Little Willow I have a theory.  Now, I know you can't possibly put all of my posts in your Who Says pages, cause I post so durn much.  So you go through some kind of selection process to determine which ones to include.  I've noticed, however, that merely mentioning you in a post is sometimes all that's required.  I seem to recall one of the posts on the page being a simple shoutout to you. I'll bet, for example, that this post will end up there, just 'cause I mention you.  Not 'cause it's particularly entertaining.  Or maybe it is, by virtue of the fact that I bring this up.  This is all getting quite circular...  (Don't be too mad at me for calling into question the purity of your motives)    :)<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - all the above.<BR>
<BR>
poohbee - yeah I know, it's a *good* depression.<BR>
<BR>
Llewellen, drewcilla - hi<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
judas - good question - if I understand you correctly, you ask whether "Angel's theme" (such as it will be) will be melodic, or instrumentally identifiable... I don't know yet.  Once (Joss & David willing) I have a theme the direction for the score will become much clearer.  I wouldn't expect it, in general, to stray too too far from the Buffy sonic universe, however.<BR>
<BR>
Ang - Frankly I won't have time to procrastinate once the two shows start in earnest.  I knda like it that way though<BR>
<BR>
DL - Believe it or not I was once one of said teenage boys (poked trombones for a whole year)<BR>
<BR>
Slayinvamps - check out the link in Sarah W's siggy - the Chris Beck Cameo Committee.  You'll find MP3's (thank you fax1 and Sarah W) of several season 2 score pieces including the love theme from the end of B2 as Buffy stabs Angel and sends him to Hell.<BR>
<BR>
LadyJack - lol<BR>
<BR>
DeM - lol, and don't worry... I'll post.  Promise<BR>
<BR>
Thanks LP.

Cynthialil - long time no see!<BR>
<BR>
judas - and "sunrise lullaby" isn't cheesy?  (no offense?) :)  Thanks for the compliments, and the unfortunately is no score CD available right now.  Someday, someday...<BR>
<BR>
gangfolles - see above, and thanks.<BR>
<BR>
zaner - I don't choose the bands for the Bronze, and I wouldn't want to speculate on the subject, since at this point any future Buffy movie is just a rumor.<BR>
<BR>
drdan - Actually, I hate coming here, but I'm a masochist so I keep coming back.  :)<BR>
<BR>
SealedNFate - Thanks.  The B/A theme will come back.. eventually.  I'm saving it for later... <BR>
<BR>
hi Charity, JustAnotherAngelLover, Aurorastar, Syd<BR>
<BR>
Brio - no, not planning on participating in the chat.  Yeah, that was me at the PBP.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - thanks.  Joey got special Indonesian biscuits for that one<BR>
<BR>
shishishishishishi - congrats on the site... I'll be sure to check it out.<BR>
<BR>
gazoo - that's the first title I've liked.  <BR>
<BR>
Night Owl - your logic, resembling earth-logic, is foolproof.  Congratulations on acing your exams!

bec - well, if you try to sing an A, and it ends up being B flat... try singing an A flat, you just might get an A!<BR>
<BR>
Ang - I don't have a favorite instrument per se - they each have their own character.  I'm not quite sure why trombones exist though.<BR>
<BR>
Strawberry - thanks<BR>
<BR>
gangfolles - I have inspiration aplenty.  What I lack is a decent work ethic (sensing a theme here... find a new theme Chris...)<BR>
<BR>
zaner - lol<BR>
<BR>
LadyJack/groupie - hi and *goofy-looking-curtsy* back<BR>
<BR>
drdan - I in fact recently had a meeting with Joss & David Greenwalt and I will indeed be scoring Angel next year.  It's tough to do both shows at once - to say I'd be a busy man would be an understatement.  We decided that I'd bring in a second composer at some point in the season to help out and maybe eventually (like season 2, if there is one, which I'm sure there will be) take over the show outright.  I've started working on a couple of theme ideas too... fun.<BR>
<BR>
melanie - you are quite correct mon amie.  If I need any albums by those guys I'll letcha now.<BR>
<BR>
Hey fax1 in Chile.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Wolven, it goes great, thanks.

Vaedus - I can't decide on a title for the snow music.  "Magic Snow Music"?  At one point some people gave me a bunch of suggestions over at alt.tv.b-v-s, but none of them really grabbed me.  I think there's no way to come up with a non-cheesy title for that one.  Thanks for the compliments by the way<BR>
<BR>
Brio - Thank you for saying nice things about me.  And, I am a proud Buffy Eh member.<BR>
<BR>
SealedNFate, Angle Man - I am curently NOT working on "Enemies".<BR>
<BR>
Hi Sachiel, Whirlwind<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer - well. "writing" in my case means music, so unless you can hum a few bars to me via email, I think I'm SOL.  In any case procrastination in my case derives more from unadulterated laziness than from lack of OK ideas<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - I am indeed well-rested.  Just an easy Buffy schedule, no other projects.<BR>
<BR>
poohbee - oh oh oh!  That XTC CD... what can I say... it's the best CD I've heard in years.  No hyperbole here.  When I put it on I get DEPRESSED.  As in, you spend years working on something, in my case even get significant recognition for it, and life is great, than you hear something that reminds you what true genius really is, and... d*mn.<BR>
<BR>
Iget the same way sometimes when I go to the LA Phil.  (Not when I saw Titanic though.)</SMALL>
