<DD><b>Sachiel:</b>  I am a HMWL that lodges in the vampire's throat and forces he/she to sing Velvet Chain songs at the top of his/her lungs so that he/she can't sneak up on any humans, therefore causing said vampire to die of malnutrition.<BR>

<b>Kara:</b>  Hmmmmmm...I think my favorite thing about the PBP was being able to play for all you guys who don't live near L.A.  Honestly!  That was great.<BR>
<b>Moriah!</b>  Ack!  Jeff told me I was supposed to give you the EP gratis since you drove so far.  I'm so sorry!  =(  (But the money will go to a very good cause!  RENT.)  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
I'm so sorry I have to run like this...(and I fell like I'm being "clubbed" to death!  lol)  I will post again soon!  Ask me then, K?  G'night!<BR>

<DD><b>katvamp:</b>  Cool!  I like that one, too.  It has a neat vibe, and I love singing in a low register, then swooping up hi like that.  (all the BV's are me on that song, btw.)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  You go, boy!  Be that walking billboard!<BR>
<b>Sachiel:</b>  I'll join HMWL...what do you mean what kind, though?  Like a singing burger or something???<BR>

<DD>OK, leaving now.<BR>
<BR>
nya - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Whirlwind, stakeme420 - my bro's set just ended, like 8 minutes ago.  It probably lasted about 30 minutes or so.  It could best be described as slightly jazzy, ambient, trippy soundscapes over not-too-intense grooves.  Thanks anybody who listened.  he just got signed to a Berlin-bas<i></i>ed record co., we will actually be working together (him & me) on a CD to be finished (hopefully) by fall.  If anyone's still interested in 6 months we'll see about getting some copies over here.<BR>
<BR>
Should've let y'all know alittle sooner... sorry... mebbe next time.<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob - yes, and for me, it is quite long thank you (2 weeks!!!)<BR>
<BR>
'K bye, again, and for good this time (well not for GOOD good, ...)<BR>

<BR>
bec - oh, you just missed like a 5 minute jam session witha  beta and everything.  now he's into some of the more ambient stuff - sounds like smaples of old film scores to me - oh wait there's the beat!  ooh this is just too cool.  I love the 20th century.  At least the last part of it.<BR>
<BR>
AjO - It goes good.  BTW the Superman score is considered by some to be THE film music masterpiece of film history... they just released the full version on CD.  Haven't had a chance to check it out yet...
