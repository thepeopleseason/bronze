<dd>Gotta get back to work, just a few quick things.<br><br>Kenix, that's VERY good.  The other stuff you showed me was decent, but that page is REALLY good.  If your storytelling's good, you should be in good shape.<br><br>Cassie, thanks hun!  Glad you're enjoying Jenna's wacky life.<br><br>slayerdaddy, it's www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ghosts/<br><br>Adios muchachos and muchachas!<br><br>Be well.<br><br>

<dd>Ramones, thanks.  :)<br><br>Dark Slayer, won't be at the Harvest, unfortunately.  Thanks for hte kind words though.<br><br>Helygen, it's been great, thanks.  :)<br><br>Roja, don't rub it in.  It's been lousy here.  Cold and rainy, even more snow.  Finally turning nice.<br><br>littlexander, go watch! :)<br><br>Sunburst, hey.  :)<br><br>Kenix!  What's up, amigo?  Doing all right.  Just finishing up a book.  And hopefully Ghosts will be on DVD at some point and you can watch it then.  Or go over someone else's house and watch, ya bum!  :)<br><br>

<dd>Molly, Wolfguard, hello there.<br><br>Littlexander . . . the feedback's been wonderful.  It's been great to know that so many people are enjoying it.  And, frankly, we're both getting a big kick out of just watching it!<br><br>
