<DD>Amish Boy:  The monks told Buffy they made the Key human.  Not just a bit human, not just animated, but human.  And ohhhhh yes -- start getting worked up.<BR>
<BR>
MusicBuff:  Thanks.  Suck away, my friend.  Have no idea if Marti got your tape.  And as for the Knights, it's always been my understanding that once they knew the Key was human, they could pinpoint its location.  Or maybe I just dreamed that last part.<BR>
<BR>
Must... leave... soon...<BR>
<BR>
Final comments?

<DD>ames: Don't sell yourself short.  You have plenty of sugar to pour.  Spiral kicked butt?  Keep talking, my friend.  <BR>
<BR>
hostile 17: Ah yes, the plot inconsistency of Damn not remembering Ben = Glory.  Really sorry I didn't catch that before it aired.  Oh well, tomorrow's another script for this flying butt monkey. ;)<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  Came in the evening just for you, pal.  And concerning Xander stealing Spike's lighter, I gotta say, I asked the same question when I saw it.  "Hey -- Xander just nicked Spike's lighter!"  Don't read too much into it.  Probably just cleaner to block that way.<BR>
<BR>
Ergoshakes:  Nothing beats a simple Fat Burger Turkey Burger.  Mmmmm!  Want, take, eat.<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo: Usually the writers are too busy to hang out on the set for any extended period of time.  But once you get to a producing level like Doug, Jane, and Fury, Joss will send you down to keep an eye on certain delicate scenes.  <BR>
<BR>
bdbdb:  Aww, shucks.  Thanks.

<DD>SPIRAL SPOILERIES<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow:  I'll have to watch the tape again.  All I can tell you is that in the script Dawn is in the Winnie with Buffy when the gang piles in.<BR>

<BR>
genrefan:  Thanks for the kind words.  It was a blast to write.<BR>
<BR>
ForeverFaith:  How did I get on the show?  Loooong story.  Check out my interview at www.thedarkestnight.com for the full story (under FEATURES, I believe).<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323: Always a pleasure.  Underwear today...let's see... ah!  Green with little snowmen.  They keep the delicates nice and cool.

Vanessa: Are the Knights human?  Sure looks that way.  Why didn't Ben leave after he fixed up Giles?  Two possible reasons.  1. Giles needed constant attention.  2. Ben was trying to decide wether or not he was going to kill Dawn.<BR>
<BR>
AngelRachel: Happy Birthday!!!<BR>
<BR>
singsinthecar:  No!  The WB has yet to forward your mail to me!  Grrrrr!<BR>
<BR>
Narrator:  Ding Ding Ding!  We have a winner.  For those of you (and you know who you are) who were complaining that we ripped off Road Warrior for this episode -- WRONG!  We ripped off Stagecoach!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Although I prefer to call it an homage.  My hands are less dirty that way.<BR>
<BR>
invincor:  When have you ever known Buffy and Co. to use guns?  Not part of the world we like to deal with (plus guns are a coward's weapon, as any Batman fan knows).  Okay, an occasional rocket launcher perhaps, but do we really want to see our gang in a firefight with the Knights?  So not Buffy.  As for running in different directions, their purpose here is to protect Dawn.<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow:  All animals in the Buffyverse will soon meet the same fate as the horsies in Spiral (which all died and were turned into glue, but we couldn't show it 'cause of our early time slot).<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of horsies, I've noticed a lot of questions concerning how they could have kept up with the Winnebago.  One huge answer: did you get a good look at that Winnie?  It's a wonder that thing could move at all.  If it could reach 20 mph I'd be shocked.  Plus the Knights were riding flying horses.  You got that, right?<BR>

<DD>BuffyBuff:  Does Dawn have a soul?  Hmmm... I guess we'll find out eventually.<BR>
<BR>
roxanna:  Thanks for the praise regarding Blood Ties.  Very kind.<BR>
<BR>
corina:  Very honored to have Fridays named after me here at the Bronze.  As for my birthday, it's October 28, 19jf0jfeqr.  Whoops!  My computer freaked out.  I'll have to get the tech in here to look at that.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow: Actually, the major cuts in Spiral were made at the outline stage.  The cuts were made for time and the always troublesome money.  The actual script reads the way it was filmed.<BR>

I think someone mentioned something about Buffy leaving Dawn with the Gang while she went off to get the wheels with Spike. I know in the script Buffy takes Dawn with her.  Dawn's not standing in the alley with the rest of the gang waiting, is she?  My mind's a little fuzzy there.<BR>

<DD>Strangely, I'm still alive. Hope the same applies to all you fine folk.  My Spider-sense is tingling, which leads me to believe there are many quetions about Spiral about to fall on me.  Okay, web-shooters full.  Let's have 'em!

<DD>Hey gang o plenty.  Just a quick howdy to tell you all I'm still in an animated  Buffy meeting.  I'll try to stop by afterwards.  If not, I promise to poke my coconut in this weekend.<BR>

Hugs & Pokes,<BR>
