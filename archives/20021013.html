<dd>RedCrayon:  Miss the Buffy ******** like a missing arm.  Luckily it’s the left one.  Love working on angel, and when you see ep. 7 you’ll know why.  This is everything I always dreamed of doing as a little kid.<br><br>Thanks to everyone for all the kind words regarding the Angel premier.  But if you think that was something, keep watching.  We’ve got one hell of a season planned, assuming we don’t run out of money – since I spent most of it on ep. 7.<br><br>

<dd>Time out for a more serious note.<br><br>Drlloyd11:  I’ve said this in the past and I can’t emphasize it enough:  I deeply regret that I hurt anyone’s feelings with my ill-conceived Succubus Club interview.  I was very tense over the whole Tara issue and pre-show fan backlash, and tried to defuse the situation with admittedly inappropriate humor.   I’m a man that can admit his mistakes, and I don’t mind apologizing repeatedly when I blunder into a big one.<br><br>I took the writing of the Willow and Tara arc very seriously.  Being able to write a loving, realistic relationship between two people who just happened to be the same sex was an honor and a privilege, and one I hope to repeat frequently if I’m ever lucky enough to helm my own show.  I think nothing can promote tolerance and understanding more than showing this kind of relationship as normal and compassionate, just like any other.  <br><br>That being said, I still support Joss’ decision to do what he did in order to tell the story he wanted to.   If I had my way, would Tara have died?  Of course not.  It was a beautiful relationship and I was sorry to see it end in such a violent, tragic manner.  But the Jossverse is built on a bedrock of pain and suffering, and this is how it played out.<br><br>Finally, I’d like to ask the rest of the Bronzers not to attack drllody11 or anyone else who’s upset with me for my  lapse of sanity and compassion on the Succubus Club.  After much reflection, I can honestly say they have every right be.   My sincerest apologies to anyone I inadvertently hurt.  I only hope you’ll give me the opportunity to make it up to you in the future, in both words and deeds.<br><br>

<dd>Allyson;  Yep, can always count on Fury for a hand.  What’d the little scamp do this time?<br><br>CarppeDi:  Thanks.  Wait till you see ep. 7.  It’s beyond big.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Grueling for everyone, especially the amazing Mike Massa and a stuntman by the name of Scott Workman.  All my hats off to these two guys.  Truly amazing work.<br><br>Corsa_am:  Anything’ll make me laugh right now.  Oh, look!  Impending doom!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!<br><br>Sarah’s Carl:  Beats the kibble out of me.  I’m a bit out of the Buffy loop at the moment.<br><br>

<dd>Yo ho ho.  Recovering from the grueling ep. 7 shoot, but thought I'd do a fly by until I collapse in about a half hour.  How are you fine folks?<br><br>
