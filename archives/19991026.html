<DD>  Well, I'm turning in...  Frankly, I can't keep up with all the posts.  [Besides, how do you follow a Joss sighting?]<BR>
<BR>
G'nite, you good, kind people.  And, really, thanks for the comments.

<DD>  Aw, God, Joss, no... You told him about my Little red Riding Hood?!  Geez...  What's next?  You gonna tell 'em about Petrie's penchant for lacey undergarments?!  <BR>
<BR>
[Oh, man... should I not have mentioned that?]

<DD>And Off I go.  i leave the field to Fury, killer ep tonight, sez I.<BR>
<BR>
I got the hugest rush from being called Neo.  Actually, I think the Wachowski Bros are Neo, anyway they make me feel like at best Morpheus... and more probably Mouse.  But it was still cool.  night all.

<DD> BTW, for those speculating...  Werewolf scratches will not turn the scratchee into a werewolf.  Bites, folks.  Bites do it.  (Need a little wolf saliva mixing in with the blood, you see.]

<DD>The shameless self plug went poorly, I thought.  Sigh.  Meanwhile, somebody explain to Fury that he has to write more episodes -- he's been pulling double duty on Buffy and Angel, keeping us afloat in a big way.  Insisted on wearing the little red riding hood outfit while he wrote, little less happy about that...

<DD>  Why, yes, I enjoy television... Joss Whedon is quite the manly, man-god of... mandom...  And those genius rumors you hear are true.  He has a great, big, manly throbbing genius...<BR>

<DD> Meg - Buffy's fear was of abandonment.  Broken-necked Josh was just the mouthpiece for that.  It was playing to that fear that unnerved Buffy and made it difficult to fend off the zombies.

<DD>Quick check in.  See FURY slacking off, shocking.  Had our crazy Barq's party, fun was had, money raised... Nick and tony and Mark all there and Aly   showed up after she finished shooting.  They kind of herded the contest winners out before we could mingle much, but i hope they had the fun.  I was just cranky cuz I couldn't watch the shows.  That's my report.  Also, the local news lady: scary, yet frightening.

<DD> DingoesPosterGirl - Willow's fear was not being able to control her magic.  (i.e. fireflies)  She talked about the "scary stuff" she was experimenting with and Oz, too, voiced his concern about her being able to handle it.

<DD> Giles Lady - Thanks much.<BR>
<BR>
silvercloud - Kate was never supposed to be a love interest for Angel.  She's just his police contact.  Sure they flirt a little, but that's it.<BR>
<BR>
No truth to the rumor (as far as I know).

DaniLynn - You're right on the money.

<DD>I feel the show in all it's success has lost alittle something. It's<BR>
still a great show its just doesn't draw me in like it used to. I feel the shows before were more personal. I also prefer when Josh writes the show and directs it.
