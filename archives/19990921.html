<DD><b>CosmicBob:</b>  We've been talking about doing a live album soon.  We really do come over well in a live situation.  Hopefully soon.  =)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  I'm great, thanks!</b><BR>
<b>XG:</b>  No response??  That's odd.  We did change the rules in July, though.  You have to sned us a SASE, and we'll send the sticker on back to you in that.  We just couldn't afford all the postage anymore.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>Jasmen:</b>  hi!<BR>

<DD>OOps... I try my best not to ignore anyone's question (though I do miss many I know - so please don't get mad)<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Sophia says that James does an excellent job.  And she was really impressed by Juliet too.<BR>
<BR>
Rum Spike:  Hard to say off hand.  I can say that I just did a quick one with producer David Solomon this season that is a fave.  Of course I always go for the Buffy vs. Faith ones too.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Take care now and I'll go off and sleep a bit.  <BR>
And please look for that special Buffy ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY that will be coming soon.<BR>

<DD><b>Jeff Pruitt:</b>  Hey, thanks!  (Woo-hoo!)  And tell Sophia I said she's a full-blown goddess.  =)<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  Thanks for the congrats!  Actually, they wanted the OLD version.  (The one they actually used on NKABOTFD), so it's going to be that master.  (mixed feelings about that one....*sigh*)<BR>
<b>EviLS IT:</b>  Oh yeah!  I remember you!  Well, the next show is going to be even cooler, 'cause we'll be doing a bunch of new songs!<BR>
<b>Rum Spike:</b>  Thank you!  We have two CDs out now, both available on the internet at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>  Also, we'll be on the BtVS soundtrack album, coming out Oct 19th.  =)<BR>

<DD>gazoo:  Thankyou.  Regis let me direct the Angel fight and the court yard stunt in this ep.  Quick - but fun.<BR>
<BR>
Lovely Poet:   You're STILL lovely though.<BR>
<BR>
XG:  Machida lives!  As long as David Greenwalt rules this planet the snake-boy will continue to roam.  He's probably at some Frat House recovering from that nasty beheading.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everybody.  I guess I'd better take off and go to bed.  I just wanted to butt in after the show aired (as usual) and add my yelps for Regis and Jane.  And also that other guy too.  You know the one.<BR>
<BR>
take care and have a good night - <BR>

<DD>evolver:  Thanks.  I designed a harness for sideways flipping for some Sprite commercials I did this summer and the only other one in exisitence is now in the hands of the stunt coordinator for X-Men.  So hopefully they will use it well.  My only other involvement with that show is peeking at some of Joss' notes once when he wasn't looking.  Too bad he isn't more involved.  He is one who understands the whole comic thing and how to bring it to real life.  Most don't get it. <BR>
<BR>
But I'm sure you know that already.

<DD> Sophia sez that she really appreciates the appreciation re: the courtyard stunt.  She was in a harness for hours and when we brought her down she was numb and bruised.  But .. Hey:)  I was happy.  heh<BR>
<BR>
Adina:  Put me down for a membership in Jane's club.  I already stalk her as it is...  I mean... I observe her.  Often.  Like right now I'm at her window on my lap top.  That's not overdoing it though in my book.  I've seen worse.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Regis for president!

<DD>YAY JANE!<BR>
<BR>
I just want to say that when I first saw Jane Espenson in the hallway I thought she was a young actress playing one of the high school girls on the show.  I had no idea that she was one of the genius writers that Joss hired.  She is sweet and cute and brilliant.  I'm happy to see her stopping by the PB.  <BR>
<BR>
Also I want to shout out from the roof top (no pun intended) for the awesome directing job that our regular editor Regis Kimble did.  He ... what is it the kids say?  Oh.  Sophia sez the word is "rocked!"  <BR>
<BR>
... and Jane... Sophia also says that "berk" is really not that nasty.  So you can say it.  (Even though I'll bet you'll probably turn red while doing so)</SMALL>

<DD>Okay, a few more things before I go.   I wrote the 5th episode of Angel for next season, and it's chock full o' Cordy.... so if you want some funniness, I recommend it.<BR>
<BR>
Also, this WGN thing... how can we stop it?  My parents are no longer going to be able to watch the show in Central Iowa, and I'm already stuck with having to tape Voyager eps and mail 'em to 'em...  something must be done!<BR>
<BR>
Okay, real bye now.<BR>

<DD>Hi again.  Yeah, I'm on for season 4... episode 3 of Buffy and number  5 of Angel, so far. <BR>
And, about "berk,"  yeah, it's British slang, and I'd read it somewhere and knew it was an insult, but I thought it was pretty mild.  Then Joss told me what it meant... it's really, really vile... pretty much the worst thing you could say.  I'm very proud.

<DD>Hmm.  guess I don't know the newest VIP col<i></i>or code, but it really is me.  I wrote Earshot, except for the bits Joss rewrote (including, of course, the brilliant scene with Jonathan in the tower).  I'm just so pleased to see that y'all seem to have enjoyed it!
