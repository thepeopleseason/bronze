<dd><b>roja:</b>  Hey there!  I didn't see you!  :-P  Hey, I still ended up with $1,000 for my trouble, and I'm proud I just got on the show!  Say it loud, say it proud, "I lost on Jeopardy!!"  ;-)<br><br><b>OzLady:</b>  Cool!  I'll definitely let you know if I'm performing then.  And thanks for passing on the lovely compliment from your daughter!  You just made my day!  =)  Oh, and yes, I've been to Austin.  We went through there when we did our big US tour a few years ago.  Great city.  You should have a blast!<br><br>OK, I think I should go now.  I need to eat and get ready for my audition.  Maybe I'll stop by later...<br><br>Ciao!<br><br>~Erika<br><br>

<dd><b>Mr. Holtz:</b>  Hi there!  And yes, certainly:  if you buy it, I'll get money.  It's a good arrangement.  ;-)  And you're starting a two-year music degree, eh?  Sounds exciting!  Are you in Scotland currently, or elsewhere?<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  Thanks!  I think it's great news, too!  hehehe  Once the album is completed, you'll be able to buy them at our website, www.velvetchain.com, like always.  (We're not taking pre-orders right now, 'cause it's too hard to keep track of them this far out from the completion date.)  Also, if things go well, we may end up signing some sort of deal on this album, so you'll be able to find the record in stores, as well.  We'll definitely keep you posted.  =)<br><br><b>OzLady:</b>  Hey!  I'm looking forward to the symposium next Spring!  We'll have a brand-new album to sell and everything!  ;-)  How are you?<br><br>

<dd><b>halfrek:</b>  Thanks!  As for being busy, yep, I know it!  But now that I'm in between acting gigs, I don't feel busy <i>enough!</i>  ;-)  But I have another audition today, so we'll see.  Keep a good thought for me, OK?  =)<br><br><b>newt:</b>  Hey, there!  Yeah, I thik we can still call them albums.  The industry does, at least.  It's like, the album is the collection of songs itself, the artistic piece, so to speak, and the CD is the physical object.  At least, that's how I think of it!  hehehehe<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Beldin!</b>  Good to <i>be</i> back!<br><br><b>Nikka:</b>  Oh, cool!  Yeah, a lot of my friends are going to Burning Man...  I've never been, but I've heard it's pretty f'in amazing.  So, the dancing at Dar Maghreb is still going well?  That's great!  =)<br><br>
