<DD>I really am leaving, you know -- just had to say:  Seth OWNS Enemy of the State, he's SO cool in it.  It's young character actor heaven but Seth walks away with it.  Had to say.  <BR>
<BR>
Glad, by the way, to see the coupling debates still simmering.<BR>
<BR>
okay, goneness of reality, take care.    me called "j" or<BR>
"unca j"  or "uncas son of uncas" (points for decipering that last ref).

<DD>@llan, that don't sound like Aly  .  Chris Carter didn't steal the idea of the big steadicam shot from Anne -- I'm excited to see how he uses it -- we were a little limited in what we could do.  Yes I know why Cordelia will end up in LA.  In fact, I know EVERYTHING>  I know what you're thinking right now.  It's disgusting!  But that one part was cute, the part with the hats.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I gotta go.

<DD>About Angel, Charisma WILL be joining the cast, that's officially going into the works.  The other regular will be Whistler or a Whistler-type character -- that has yet to be cast.  As for Buffy eps, I'll shoot 5 this year again, probably write all of those, plus my usual rewriting.  Uh oh.  Simpsons beckons.

<DD>Sunnydale is in fact near Santa Barbara.  We are on ep 12, entitled "Helpless".  Written by David Fury who wrote GO FISH -- but this one is very different from that.  This week a short week!  Turkey!  Relatives I don't hate!  Something resembling rest!  (I'm giddy).
