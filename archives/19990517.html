<DD>RSO's top <b>delf, DragynGirl, and David Fan!</b>  =)<BR>
<b>Paris Angel:</b> hehehe...the coolest, eh?  *blush*  Well, L.W. wrote, directed, produced, and starred in (Although she'll say she didn't star) a play this past weekend called "Surreal World."  A take-off on "The Real World," except with fictional TV characters living together instead of live human beings.  (If you can really call those MTV people live human beings...)  L.W. played the only real person.  "Willow Whedon."  Good name, eh?  lol<BR>
<b>thy Slayer:</b>  Hi!  Thanks, I hope so, too.<BR>
<b>Kyle:</b>  Hey, congratulations!  Woo-hoo!  =)<BR>
<b>Oki LL'byte:</b>  Nope, didn't see her posts...and my head's doing better, thanks.  Doing physical therapy for the lingering jaw problem.  Ick.<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  I'm well, thanks.  How are you?<BR>
<b>W-Sky:</b>  Hi, nice to meet you!<BR>
<b>Little WIllow:</b>   Hmmm....well, it should be $22 plus shipping, 'cause that's the normal deal.  Why don't you e-mail me though, and we'll tlak about it, OK??

<DD>RSO's to <b>Alpy, FASTEDDIE, and Missi!</b><BR>
<b>Carita:</b>  Hello!  Yes, I really did enjoy myself.  Jeff did, too.  =)<BR>
<b>David Fan:</b>  Hehehehe....not really anything original.  I've always been partial to the Mafia-connection theory, myself.  =)  Have you seen the episode lately?<BR>
<b>CharlieX:</b>  You don't know the <i>half</i> of it!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Willow:</b> Hi!  Welll, that depends on if we get signed or something before we finish the record, but probably not.  It will however, be available online, as usual.  We plan on having it completed by October.

<BR>
<b>Little Willow:</b>  If you're here, or even if you're not, GREAT JOB on Saturday.  Just wanted to post that.  =)<BR>
<BR>
Won't be here too long...our site is just BLOWING UP for some reason(in a good way...like 200 registrations a day...) and I gotta figure out how I'm going to input all this new info.  *sigh*  But, hi!

Hey slay_me, delf<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Oki'LLbyte<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie - most likely not, although there is a possibility of a track or two.  (Write to TVT!)  See my post below, there may be a score album some time after the song album.<BR>
<BR>
A, HL - I thought you'd never ask.  I've been dying to get this off my chest.<BR>
<BR>

AngelLover24-7 - thanks, and yes I'm very excited about "Angel".<BR>
<BR>
Fuchsia - thanks.  Say hi to Todd for me.<BR>
<BR>
Pixie - I'm good now that I've slept some.  Glad to hear LW's play rocked... so how many Bronzers ended up going?<BR>
<BR>
Green Falcon, M.W. - At this point the "Angel" theme is very much in the air.  I did send Joss and David a few ideas, which they liked, but at this point nothing's set in stone and the theme is still up for grabs.<BR>
<BR>
As far as a score CD goes nothing has changed.  I've been told six months to a year after the song CD comes out (which may yet have one score piece on it) Fox will give the OK for a score album.  It's totally tentative right now but I remain hopeful.<BR>
<BR>
OzLady - I'm already on to my next project... an HBO political thriller called "Caracara".  Just wrapping up a feature "Dog Park" this week as well.  I'm supposed to go rafting in Idaho in two weeks.  (Funny joke no?)<BR>
<BR>
A, HL - No, I write the instrumental music that plays in the background, not the songs.  John King, the music coordinator, helps narrow down a list of songs for each scene and then Joss picks the one he likes.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Dragyn grrl.<BR>
<BR>
banana - thanks.  The latest B/A theme (#3 I suppose, the "broken up" theme) gets some major play in the finale.  Oops, is that a spoiler?

Hey fax.  No, you haven't but feel free - I need to be reminded.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Hi Kenickie, oki'LLbtye, Shadowslayer<BR>
<BR>
Hey theatergirl (can I still call you Madrigal?) see my post below.  And it most assuredly *is* overload.<BR>
<BR>
CharlieX - Who said I planned to be gone?   :)<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - You'll be happy to hear the project is once again underway... package is going out tomorrow.

Hey -mere- guess I'll be seeing you soon.  And tell RD to go easy on me with the music notes next season.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks stakegrrrl.<BR>

Congrats to Little Willow on the play.  Someone who was there tell me just *how* awesome it was please?

Hi FASTEDDIE, WildWeasel, faithful avanger<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - Thanks, you must have one of them satellite thingies, no?<BR>
<BR>
Asanti, Horselover - thanks<BR>
<BR>
DoBoy - Yes, I've been approached about scoring "Angel".  It's gonna be a little hellish doing both for a while, but I plan to bring on another composer to gradually take "Angel" over from me.<BR>
<BR>
CharlieX - I've heard the single, "Duel of the Fates", which blew me away.  I'm avoiding the CD until I see the movie (tomorrow, midnight, Mann's Chinese).  John Williams is better than anybody and in a hundred years his music will be played alongside Mozart's and Beethoven's.  I'll put money down on that too.
