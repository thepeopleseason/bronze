<DD>Gonna join the esteemed Mr. Beck in saying G'nite.  Thanks again for kind words for tonight's ANGEL - I'll share your congrats with Jeanine.  (I've said it before, it's tough to follow a Joss Whedon masterpiece.)  <BR>
<BR>
Long live, Wesley...  Nite.

<DD>AjO - No character is envisioned as a replacement.  They each arrive, fully formed from the brain of Joss, to serve interesting story arcs.  That goes for returning characters, as well.  Or Councils (to be named later).

Solas - Depends on the film and the director, but in films composers generally get more opportunities to write longer, more *musical* pieces, due to the (generally) different pacing of films.  But of course things vary wildly... I'd be hard-pressed to think of a better opportunity for a composer than "Hush" in film *or* TV.  Now if only they'd given me three weeks and a 70-piece orchestra...<BR>
<BR>
AjO - no idea what you're talking about.  Probably that means no, at least not intentionally.<BR>
<BR>
Good night and thanks again to everyone.

Hey it's Mr. Fury.  Thanks David.<BR>
<BR>
Safarigirl - I may be thinking of a different Buffy recipe site, but didn't i already contribute a recipe of my mom's?  To answer your question, cigarettes and Diet Coke.<BR>
<BR>
skylar - no worries, I can't speak for the producers, but you're allowed to have opinions.<BR>
<BR>
Meteor - Yup, that was me.  It's kind of a slightly-generic-techno-TV-scoring feel isn't it?  More groove oriented.  Well, I enjoyed working on that show, and the producers and I are still friends, but see below re: Buffy's greatness in the composer gig department.  It's tough to compare.<BR>
<BR>
And yes that is the Dodi, he was one of the finance guys on the original FX movie, so his name is in the credits.<BR>
<BR>
Solas - you can see my credits at imdb.com.  I've done a dozen movies or so, a few of which have actually been in theaters in the last year or two.  I've got another one coming up over the next few months.  HINT it stars an actor/actress who was/is in Buffy....

<DD>Solas - There is no other show I would want to write for, except, of course, ANGEL.  I hope to continue to do so until Joss or David G. calls Security to have me forcibly removed from the office.

LilBufBuf - I'm almost positive that was not Sarah screaming.  I do know for certain that when they shot it, she merely opened her mouth as if to scream, knowing all along they would put it in later.  I'm pretty sure they got someone else besides Sarah to do the actual scream.  As to whether it worked for you or not, well, I can see why some might think it sounded unrealistic.<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer - that was Elin (see below)<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel - the devil's fifth - as in a diminished fifth?  the satanic interval?<BR>
<BR>
Angelphyre - I *did* manage to squeeze Joss (love the image) for one extra day.<BR>
<BR>
Eric - the GD2 music is not available anywhere right now.  And to run down your (long!) list... Elfman, already said it, one of my top all-time, hard to pick a fave but "A Simple Plan" most recently; Fiedel, sorry, not into him at all; Jerry rocks, "The Edge" was a good one, love the trombones for the bear; Mychael Danna I also love, I'd love to model my career after his; Badalamenti is overrated; Jan Hammer, well, he's so 80's; only know Tim Truman's work on those few eps I saw of 90210, what is there to say; Tom Newman is godlike no matter what he does; Moroder see above re: Hammer; Philip Glass I like for  three minutes at a time; Mark Isham writes beautiful melodies but his trumpet playing gets to me; and Blade Runner ROCKS.  Am I done?<BR>
<BR>
'stina, deM - your lip-reading guess is right on<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx - the buffy Riley kiss was violins on the melody over a bed of cellos and low brass filling in chords (all fake).  There's a hint of an English Horn counter melody (real, played by Chris Bleth) that sneaks in as the kiss stops.  If you mean the hug and the talking before the kiss, that was my old favorite, viola, played by Evan Wilson, who is the principal violist for the LA Phil.

AjO - Not that you asked, but since you bring it up, singer's name is Elin Carlson.  She also did all the "oh those poor half-demon folk" bits in my friend Rob Kral's score to "Hero" two weeks ago.<BR>
<BR>
Haven - Joss picked "Danse Macabre", bas<i></i>ed on a number of choices narrowed down by John King.  I, for one, was thankful for the break.<BR>
<BR>
Solas - My M.O. while composing is very instinctual, and not at all intellectual.  Besides the parameters I'm given at the outset (which, in this case, was a general direction from Joss as well as my own impressions of the story and characters) It's really as simple as... mess around till it sounds cool to me, then put it in and move on.<BR>
<BR>
I don't mind being compared to Danny Elfman, I consider it a huge compliment.  Hopefully I bring something of my own to the score as well, but the use of the voice and certain harmonies (particularly during the last three minutes or so of Act 2) are right out of his bag of tricks.  Hmm I think I said that already.<BR>
<BR>
Trivia note: I finished composing the last seconds of Act Four late Saturday afternoon, ie. three days ago.  So those of you expecting a satellite feed on Sunday and didn't get it - my fault.  <BR>
<BR>
Oh and count me among the new Wesley fans tonight.  I loved seeing him back.

titania - the only Buffy stuff of mine in sotres is the one track on the official album.  Other than that you can pick up my score to "Guinevere" in most stores as well.  There *will* be a Buffy score CD - it just might take a little time.<BR>
<BR>
slayergrl99 - In fact, and I can't emphasize this enough, THERE IS NO OTHER SHOW I would rather compose for than Buffy.  Not Angel (though I do have a good deal of fondness for it, and it comes in a close second) and not The Practice.  And exhibit one is "Hush".  For all the reasons you mentioned.<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel - Indeed those were the actors whispering.  Much of it was taken out but a few select consonants and especially breathing was left in.

Big thank yous to all...<BR>
<BR>
I prefer not to think of Emmys just yet.  It's early.  I have 12 more chances to top myself.<BR>
<BR>
LJC - There were 25 minutes of score in Hush.  Not a record by any stretch (GD2 had closer to 30) but it wasn't the quantity that made it so spectacularly time-consuming - it's the fact that 23 of those 25 minutes are for intensely music-driven moments.  Like the end of the Wish, or Amends... I need to spend extra time on those moments because I know how prominently they will play.  23 minutes of that... don't wanna think about it.  Much less do it again.<BR>
<BR>
Adamlyle - Robert Kral wrote the score to tonight's Angel episode, I'll pass your compliments on to him.  I'll let you tell Joss the other part yourself...

<DD>Okay a couple of things.<BR>
<BR>
Firstly, the Danny Elfman <BR>
influence was indeed strong in <BR>
the score.  Partly because I'm a <BR>
huge fan to begin with, but also <BR>
because Joss and Regis (the <BR>
editor) used "Sleepy Hollow" as <BR>
their temp score.  It had a <BR>
storybook/fairytalish quality <BR>
that Joss really liked.  The use <BR>
of voice and celeste (and other <BR>
tinkly bits) in particular are <BR>
early Danny Elfman (think Edward <BR>
Scissorhands) trademarks.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly the piece Giles used for <BR>
his presentation was "Danse <BR>
Macabre" b
