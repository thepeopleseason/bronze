<DD>Damn, I was so close to gone... just wanted to mention: the red curtains weren't actually a Twin Peaks homage -- in fact I thought of cutting them when I remembered the connection.  But I had my own reasons (rather obvious, I thought) for wanting willow to go into them, so I kept 'em.  Also, I've never read Hellblazer and I've never seen the Pillow Book.  (I did see the POSTER for it, though, something I had forgotten until Amber brought it up.)  I don't go much for the obvious homage EXCEPT in the case of Apocalypse now, becasue a)I always have that dream where I'm watching something I know, it's different and kind of lame, and then I'm in it, b)it seemed right for Xander that in his own dark journey, the Kurtz figure would be his disapproving highschool principal and c)it just made me laff my ass off (yes, I am now assless.  Hard to sit)<BR>

I posted much of this last night but it got et so there it is.  Must go, laziness calls.

<DD>Slavey, don't start with me.  We both know that money goes right up your nose!  You have to deal with it:  YOU HAVE A SINUTAB PROBLEM.<BR>
<BR>
As for th' french -- we were presented with a crappy, comical over-reading from someone in loop group, so at the last minute I dragged my assistant DIEGO in to read it.  He's Mexican, speaks a little french (yeah, he's trilingual, which for someone as barely unilingual as myself is both annoying and annoying) and he was reading oof a script so it may not have sounded perfect to some but the effect was just great for the dream.  Now y'know.

<DD>Actually, I don't have a hell of a lot to say.  Just scrolling, seeing the varied reactions and theories.  Fascinating.  Well, to me.  I don't get out much.  I am old, and much with the unseemly odor.
