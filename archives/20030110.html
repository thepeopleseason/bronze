<dd>PJ--thanks.  :)  We'll liven it up "a bit," but can't go too far given Buffy's season six, resurrection-girl depression.<br><br>And that's it.  Nice to see you all.  Gone now.  And not in a Ty way.  (For those who remember).<br><br>Adios.<br><br>

<dd>Thoin, okay, now you've got ME confuzzled.  LOL<br><br>RE: PBP, I'm afraid not.  It never works out for me.  Right now, my schedule for the year tentatively includes the following:  In May, Tom Sniegoski and I should be at the big E3 video game show in Vegas.  In June, I'll be at Moonlight Rising in the Catskills with Amber, Tony Head, James Marsters and Adam Busch.  In June/July, I'll probably be doing some signings in various California locales.  In August I'll be at WizardWorld Chicago.  In November, I'll be at World Fantasy Convention in DC.<br><br>ONe of these days.<br><br>

<dd>Web Warlock...thanks.  :)<br><br>Thoin...trust me.  It's early season six.  A very carefully chosen point in time so we could do what we needed for our story without tripping over various season six plot threads . . . or tripping over Spike and Buffy boinking in a cemetery somewhere.<br><br>CarpeDi and idream . . . thanks.<br><br>

<dd>slayerdaddy--trust me.<br><br>corsa am, narrator, angelbaby--thanks.  :)<br><br>Meg... oh, honey, Spike gets some time, but shining probably ain't the word.  Horrible, horrible agony, indignity and hot sex, those are the words.<br><br>Thoin, good to see ya.  No new Buffy book, I'm afraid.  Last one was Wisdom of War.  (Though I did have a short story in that Angel anthology . . . had a lot of fun with that.)  Of course, you could always buy one of my originals.  :)<br><br>

<dd>Old One . . . thanks.  :)  Good to see you too.<br><br>Cirrus Kain--Oh, yes, a massive plothole . . . cuz THAT wouldn't ever have occurred to us.  :)<br><br>Demons are a lot like humans in that everyone has mixed blood.  But there are always going to be those who think of themselves as that much "purer" than the next guy.  *koff* Adolf  *koff*<br><br>

<dd>CarpeDi--weird, me too.  :)<br><br>slayerdaddy, it is, by far, the longest Buffy novel yet (if you don't count the serialized Lost Slayer.)  <br><br>Narrator, Much violence and some quips.  Though it's season six, during which there was a marked quip shortage.<br><br>

<dd>Zoni... weeeeee!  :)  Hi.<br><br>dogtrot . .. thanks.  And I guess I should mention the huge war of demonic purification and stuff, but hey, you can't give everything away.<br><br>Narrator . . . yes, Artie is clearly a whiz of a wiz.<br><br>

<dd>Jay, it's called MONSTER ISLAND.  As it's a Buffy/Angel crossover with oh, maybe fifty characters, you'd think Tom Sniegoski and I wouldn't have had much room, but oddly enough, even with so much going on, Tara gets a few chances to shine on her own.  :)<br><br>As to what it's about . . . well, here's a bit . . . There's a demon named Axtius who is a real anti-human, anti-halfbreed bigot.  But he's also a hypocrite, with something to hide.  Namely, he's got a halfbreed son of his own.  He's ashamed, particuarly since he's now part of a major demon purity movement.  Secretly, he's found a spell that might be able to eliminate the human portion from his halfbreed son.  So he tracks his offspring down . . .<br><br>Only to find out his son is dead.<br>Boy is he pissed.<br>Axtius's son was Francis Doyle.<br>And the demon blames Angel for Doyle's death.<br><br>
