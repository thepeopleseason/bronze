<DD><i>next to last...</i><BR>
Lupe: We're playing in Hollywood on 11/11/99 (Thursday). All the info (except the fact that it's 21+...d'oh!) is on our <a target='_blank' href="http://www.darlingvioletta.com">site</a> and thanks!<BR>
<BR>
FSM: I'll be attending. Seems a long way off but it'll be here before you know it.<BR>
<BR>
Adina: Ah, the guilt!<BR>
<BR>
Witchy Woman: That's a good idea! Just request it when you order!<BR>
<BR>
Zeus: It's a surprisingly tasty combo!<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Sure, same thing...just put it in your order e.<BR>
<BR>
Charity...: Thank you!<BR>
<BR>
lurking b and Sita: 'night! Sweet dreams (are made of this...)<BR>
<BR>
Blueronin: That sounds good!<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer: Sniffles are going around lately...I'm doin good (sleepy but good).</vgreen>

<DD><i>leaving soon...</i><BR>
Blueronin: Hey there! How're things?<BR>
<BR>
Acid Cross: Thanks! I'm really proud of the new CD.<BR>
<BR>
lurking b: Yeah, that was very weird. When you see the show, the Bronze is this noisy, happening place. When they film (at least when there is dialog) it's silent as a tomb! I'm sure we'll be playing somewhere this summer (all ages, hopefully).<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Yep, that's her in the middle section and she's whispering...<i>something</i>...at the end as Angel walks down the alley. I'm still working on getting the Buffy soundtrack so don't fret! But you can get "bath water flowers" at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.darlingvioletta.com">The Darling Violetta Home Office</a>! Sorry, it's a habit! ;)<BR>
<BR>
Sita: I've been there! I'm on the wagon 'til New Year's myself! Gotta save at least a couple brain cells. *g*</vgreen>

<DD>Witchy Woman: Cool. If you liked the last one at all you're gonna love this one!<BR>
<BR>
Adina: So it was YOU! *g* That's OK cuz I got a Molson Ice instead!<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer: Hiya back! How're you?<BR>
<BR>
FSM: Missed you in Vegas (aka Disneyland for grownups)! How're ya?<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Nice to be needed (or is that kneaded?) *g* I'm doing well. I'll tell Cami.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius: I've only read positive feedback on the theme (but secretly behind my back...*g*). Seems to strike a nerve! Tour is probably next year. VC,FSM and DV should tour together and call it Buff-a-palooza. Study well!<BR>
<BR>
Wicked Wicca: Hi and Bye!<BR>
<BR>
Sita: Happy belated and good luck with the contest!<BR>
<BR>
Mabb: Night!<BR>
<BR>
lurking b: Thanks for the kind words!</vgreen>

<DD>Jasmen: I can't apologize enough (see SoCal mailing list post) for having to take off suddenly. You know how bad the parking was in town that night and my ride showed up telling me (truthfully) that we had all of 3 minutes to get out of the lot. You know I'm not (always *g*) that rude and I'd never do that to you without circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius: No worries! This one's not a limited edition or anything. Glad people like the slogan ;)<BR>
We're gonna be working on some new MP3's soon...maybe some net only stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Acid Cross: Good to meet you too, cool fangs!<BR>
<BR>
b: I'd love to come to Oz! Hoping to tour sometime soon. No hard plans yet and international may be a while...(crossed fingers). You can order with a credit card from CDNow.com or any of the other online stores. It should be available online from those sources before the end of the year. <BR>
<BR>
EviLSIT: We'll keep ya posted. Fake ID's aren't too hard to find! *g*</vgreen>

<DD><b>DARLING VIOLETTA WANTS TO KILL YOU...</b><BR>
<i>softly, with our songs *g*</i><BR>
<BR>
We're now taking pre-orders for THE KILL YOU EP at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.darlingvioletta.com">The Darling Violetta Home Office</a> which means you can be the first on your block with our new tunes.<BR>
<BR>
Also, we're playing at The Gig Hollywood this Thursday 11/11/99 at 9:30. $5 with flyer available at the Home Office (or email us from the site before Wednesday). This show is 21+ with ID. Apologies to all our friends from out of town who're "under age". We tried to get them to waive the age limit to no avail. However, there's some coolness on the horizon that will be open to all comers!<BR>
<BR>
Yay, it's LOSERS and I see me buds in da house! Vegas rocked!<BR>
<BR>
SO's to all my buds and those who will be!</vgreen>
