<DD>okay, well, <i>that</i> sucked.  my <b>Mesuvius</b> post got all et up...<BR>
<BR>
to continue...<BR>
<BR>
<b>THINGS THAT ARE STILL PARTAKETHING OF LE SPOIL</b><BR>
<BR>
<small>Mesuvius: i'm gonna try to reconstruct my comment here, but i swear -- the first one was lucid and thought-provoking.  also, i was planning to win a Nobel prize for literature with it, but, hey.  you can't win 'em all.  as i was saying...<BR>
<BR>
i think Wes wanted to push Bethany in two ways: IMMEDIATELY and HARD. like he tells Cordy, he wanted to get her to react before she could her defenses up.  they needed to discover the emotional genesis of her power, and there are only two ways you can get to someone's core:  sneak attack, and prolonged siege.  seeing as how this girl was so dangerous (and seeing as how the show's only 44 minutes long), prolonged siege was out.  sneak attack was in.<BR>
<BR>
BuffyBuff: the way i always pictured it, Lilah knew where Bethany's father was the whole time, but didn't tell <i>him</i> that she knew where <i>Bethany</i> was. when they talk about "the Trigger", as in, "Pull the Trigger," they are referring to Bethany's father.  they want to get the two of them in a room together so Bethany can just go ballistic, kill the crap out of him, take that step over to the Dark Side, and thus be more malleable to their plans for her, e.g., becoming their assassin.  i think Lilah probably called Bethany's father with a whole, "I'm her friend, I know where she is, and I think she needs to go back home with you" story-masquerading-as-friendly-concern thing. i don't think Bethany's father was "in" on anything -- he's just yet another W&H pawn.<BR>
<BR>
OzLady: yes, the rumpled covers line was all-Joss, all-the-time. as for channeling Cordy, again, the lion's share of her dialogue was Jossian -- and he can channel these characters like no one else, considering he... you know.  <u>created them out of nothingness.</u>  i bow before him.  (only when i'm not wearing a skirt, though.)</small><BR>

<DD>okay, bear with me, folks.  i haven't done the mass-posting-to-multiple-readers thing in a while, so... forgive me if i miss you.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob</b>: the story of how Joss came to direct my episode is a long one, but suffice it to say that we shot a few eps out of order, and mine just happened to be slotted in the space Joss was set to direct.  witness my unhappiness about this:  *Snoopy dance!* *Snoopy dance!* *Snoopy dance!*<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kiba Rika</b>: Joss could take 100% all-natural poo and turn it into a fantastic episode, so... i guess i'm just lucky mine was only 98% poo.<BR>
<BR>
thanks, <b>squirt</b>!<BR>
<BR>
<b>SarahNicole</b>: um... you were bouncing up and down <i>until</i> you saw my name?  what'd you do <i>after</i> you saw it?  weep copious tears and rend your clothing in anguish and despair?  'cause i think you and Joss may have something in common...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Narrator</b>: well, the first draft of the script took me a week... the second draft less... the third draft about the same... the fourth draft less... and then the final draft took, like, no time at all.  'cause Joss wrote it. <small>thank GOD.  one more draft and i would have yarked directly into my hard drive.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Minerva</b>: i'm not really a VIP -- i just like the pretty colors, and it means free posting for everyone. <small>ever the altruist am i.  which begs the question, can one be a *misanthropic* altruist?</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>kawaii_Marc</b>: believe me, i was NOT hating the sweatiness of the b-ball Marc Blucas.  see, "hate" would imply that there was no salivation involved.<BR>
<BR>
thank you very much, <b>T-Bear</b>.  that means a lot.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Sarah's carl</b>: baby, i'm <i>always</i> available.  <small>did that sound desperate?</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Corvus</b>: hopefully i'll be writing episode 11, but all that could change.  they could, instead, fire me, beat me bloody with a 9-iron, and leave me for dead in an alley somewhere.  i'm hoping for episode 11, though.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Morella</b>: you read SPOILERS for my episode?  do you even realize what you just said? that's like saying, "Hey, Mr. Bull!  I'm gonna pull down my pantalones now and wave my bright red knickers at you!"  spoilers are BAD, <b>Morella</b>. they are soul-corrupting snippets of Satan-spawned information. avoid. avoid. AVOID!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Angel</b>: yes, i get my story ideas from pure and simple genius.  i like to call him "Joss".<BR>
<BR>
<b>Circe</b>: get... what... thing? did you send me plague again?  and here's something odd -- i <i>have</i> read "When Rabbit Howls".  i read it years ago, and didn't even <i>think</i> about the correlation until i saw it on the board.  but i have to say, i can't deny the parallel there.  maybe i really <i>do</i> have a subconscious... ... ... ... nah.  never mind.  i don't.<BR>
<BR>
<b>THINGS THAT PARTAKETH OF LE SPOIL</b><BR>
<BR>
<small>Meeby and Immanuel Kant: okay, so here's the thing about the "Do it.  Finish it." line. in the original script, i had something akin to those lines, but i toned it down, so it looked like Angel was telling her, "Put your father down and get on with your life."  we shuffled and shuffled those lines (as i recall), until Joss finally decided to go with what you saw on Tuesday night.  at first i was a little leery -- foolish, foolish -mere-, who should know to Trust In Joss by now -- but when i saw the scene as it was being shot, i realized that this was the "correct" way to end the scene.  "correct" in the sense of, Angel knows what kind of hell Bethany's been through -- especially after what i've come to think of as "The Chambermaid Speech". [insert effulgent Joss-praise here.] Angel knows that this girl has been violated, that violence is a core component of what makes Bethany who she is.  if he had said something all pansy-like (i.e., "Put your father down and get on with your life."), i think Bethany would've rebelled, tossed her father out the window and NOT caught him.  but Angel realized that he needed to give Bethany the freedom to make the choice herself... hoping she would make the right one.  and sometimes that's all there is: hope.  there are no certainties, no assurances that someone will do the right thing -- you just... hope.  and while that may seem kind of insubstantial and, at times, dangerous -- that's human nature.  nothing black and white.  all shades of gray.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>hey, gang!<BR>
<BR>
i've been reading the "Angel" discussions with some avidity -- okay, i've been reading them <i>greedily</i> -- and am beyond pleased by the reactions, questions, and issues "Untouched" brought up.  <BR>
<BR>
<b>SPOILERS FOR "UNTOUCHED" - RUN AWAY!  RUN AWAY!</b><BR>
<BR>
<small>the ending, in which Bethany does NOT kill her father, was my idea.  at first it was just about, "wouldn't it be cool if she, like, threw him out of a 50-story building?" and then i thought, "oh, but wouldn't it be cooler if she STOPPED him before he hit the ground?" i'd love to say that the theme of being-a-better-person-than-your-abuser was the catalyst for the idea, but in truth, the idea came first, and then i went, "oh, that's all themey!"  and of course, the 50-story building became Angel's hotel, but i think it played just as well.</small><BR>
