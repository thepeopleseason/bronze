<BR>
Little Willow:  Though you should know there's yet another, very purposeful this time, reference to "Little Willow" in one of the books, Gatekeeper #2 to be exact.  *G*

bye again<BR>

P.S. Fidelia, that I was a piece I "wrote", more like "assembled" from some sampled phrases I had of Gregorian chanting.

Lil Wil - ask Sarah W.<BR>
<BR>
Angelus7 - I'm 95% sure the guitarist who played the end of "Lover's Walk" did not use any alternate tunings.  He's probably just got long fingers.  Which is a good attribute for a session guitarist to have, I suppose.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W. - I do not personally know Philip Glass.  I sang in a singing group with a woman who now, or at least recently, and for a good few years, does all the vocals for his Philip Glass Ensemble.  Try this one:<BR>
Knock knock?<BR>
Who's there?<BR>

Shadowslayer, RJ - thanks.<BR>

Gregg, bubbles & brandon - hey.  Faith - hey, and yes, it's working.<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady, Corvus - I currently have plans to go.  I can't say for sure due to my unpredictable schedule but I sure would like to.<BR>
<BR>
OK angle man - This is the absolute truth - none of the spoilers I have read are true.<BR>
<BR>
Chris Golden - I'm a huge Keb Mo fan.  Blues sounds great.  And until Giles sees another loved one die, there will be no Giles singing.  And Apollo is full of doodoo for not letting you post in col<i></i>or...<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - lol!!<BR>

<DD>Gregg: Thanks, bud.  The Gatekeeper Trilogy is going to be very different from what we've done so far.  It's truly an epic, and that means breaking down the walls that usually rule the stories.  It's sort of like the 24 hour all-apocalypse channel.  It's also the first Buffy book that some of the younger readers might actually have a hard time following, just because it's so convoluted.

<BR>
Pixie - I'm sure Bobbi would be very gratified to know she helped you get the part.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - I asked Joss this morning who wrote & directed it.  And he told me.  And... I forget (honestly).  But Joss was neither of them.  So it is indeed a top-of-the-line episode, but not the way Joss' episodes are top-of-the-line - it's stylistically a little different, and that's what I love about it.  You see, for the freshness.<BR>
<BR>
To anyone with song suggestions - I'm not the guy you want.   I just write the background music.<BR>
<BR>
Lil Wil - Cool.  I could see how that would work, the B/A theme in waltz time.  When to I get to hear the Vampire's Waltz?  Send it to RyanH, he can do a MIDI for you.<BR>
<BR>
DeM - Well, that was merely an (apparently) futile attempt at a joke.  I'm not even going to bother explaining it.  This is all you need to know:  it was really kinda dumb.<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - shout back atcha<BR>
<BR>
Fidelia - which piece?  The gregorian chant or the score (a cello thing) when Angel torments Dru in the confessional?<BR>
<BR>
Asanti - thanks.  Though I get paid so it isn't exactly sharing in the purest sense of the word.<BR>
<BR>
Masquerade - Ep 12 ("Helpless") will air not for a good while.  End of Jan, beginning of Feb??<BR>
<BR>
AlpineFresh - born & raised in Montreal & Toronto.  Going back (to Toronto) in 5 or so days...<BR>
<BR>
C. Golden - Cool.  And to each his or her own I guess.  For the record, the ep I'm talking about does NOT involve two small dead children.  It DOES however involve Buffy staring into a crystal.  <small>hard to tell you which one I'm talking about without spoilage</small>

gazoo, fax, and other CBCCers - I support you no matter how you react to Joss' succinct naysaying.<BR>
<BR>
Laurence - glad <i>somebody</i> likes it.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - for the record explain to me how that isn't spoiling.  Isn't it better not to know whether any spoilers are true, or at least to know that NONE of them are true (which I'm not saying BTW).  If I tell you some of them are true, 5 minutes into the ep you'll know which ones they are, or at least you'll suspect.  I was spoiled and wished I wasn't.  Speaking purely as a fan, it ruined the first half or so for me.<BR>
<BR>
Chris Golden - Thanks.  And I promise to include coverage of your book in my next score, in return.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - yes I checked my mail, and no message from you...  better try again.  Maybe I mistyped it.  Badly.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and to anyone who asked if that was me giving Todd a smooch in the Emmy picture in the fan club magazine - as you know, it wasn't me.  BUT I just did an interview with the fan mag people and sent them an Emmy picture of my very own... to appear in the next issue.  At least that's the plan.

<DD>Immortal:  Richard is an absolutely wonderful guy.  It was a real treat to work with him, especially because he really did plot the whole thing out with me . . . not like some star-authors you might be familiar with.<BR>

Laurence - I ain't comin' buddy.  just accept it.<BR>

St. Germain - I wish you luck.  Truly.<BR>

<DD>Chris Beck -- btw, of course, i meant interviewing bands IN ADDITION to the expanded music coverage you were already suggesting.  And hey, if you're talking about the same ep. 12 that I think is ep. 12, all i can say is, huh?  I liked it, but maybe not as much as you.<BR>

Ms. Alucard - The people who put together the promos do so completely independently of the production staff & crew.  I had nothing to do with the choosing of that piece, and I haven't seen the promo so I can't comment.  Sounds like a cool idea tho.<BR>
<BR>
AlpineFresh, gazoo - hi.<BR>

corvus - thanks.  Joey has recently started with voice lessons because the out-of-tune whispering was getting to me.

<DD>Hey Chris Beck! Nice to see you here.  I'd love to do more extensive music coverage.  Some interviews with the most frequently used bands.  I'll suggest it.  Volume two will probably be for seasons three and four, so don't expect it for quite some time, obviously.

OK everyone, I do not say this lightly.  Ep 12 is the best Buffy ep I have ever seen.  I have seen some spoilers for this floating around... trust me... you don't want to be spoiled.

Sarah W. -- thanks.  Seriously, there's nothing that makes me feel better than if my writing makes someone cry.  Perverse, ain't it?  Gatekeeper in three weeks!  I'm psyched.

<BR>
AngleMan:  Of Saints and Shadows was recently reprinted.  You can order through Amazon, or other online or walk-in stores, if you don't see it on the shelves.  But it is back in print as an Ace dark fantasy.  I won the Stoker for EDITING, actually.  It was for CUT: Horror Writers on Horror Film. My first book.  It's been all downhill from there (*G*)</SMALL>
