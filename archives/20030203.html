<dd>Sorry for the quick drive-by, kidlets, we're heading back into a story meeting.  But I promise more time with y'all soon, I'll swoop in for a full-fledged chat shortly.  Much love, cool cats!<br><br>

<dd>OldManFan:  Howdy… yup, tomorrow’s episode is one of mine, indeed.  Hide your pets, lock your doors.  Eat extra carbs.  Something like that.  I hope I get to make it to the Succubus Club soon, we’ve been kinda busy here at BuffyWorld, so there hasn’t been much of a chance to do fun things.  Like visit the Succubus Club.  Or sleep.  But soon, I hope.<br><br>Sunburst: Far as I know, you’ve got Jane doing 14, Petrie’s on 15 (writing AND directing, it’s gonna be AWESOME), Jane’s back on 16, then Fury and Goddard tag-teaming 17.  It’s kind of a stellar line-up, should be fun.<br><br>Phoenix: I have many, many secrets.<br><br>

<dd>Lady Ireland: Yes, he was.  Then he got involved with Abigail and he didn't tell her about his previous fling with Molly.  Molly ended up in a coma.  Which was an important cautionary tale for all of us.<br><br>I swear, you never know when one of us is gonna show up.<br><br>

<dd>In fact, little side note... The original draft had him calling out: "Mrs. Beasley."   But it just seemed wrong.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the "Mr. French" debate DeKnight and I had.  Man, it got ugly.<br><br>

<dd>For the record, Angel DID utter the name "Buffy."  But he wasn't referring to Buffy Summers.  He's just a big fan of the all-new "Family Affair" tv-series on the WB.<br><br>Glad I could clear that up.<br><br>
