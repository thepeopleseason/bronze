<dd>Twilight:  Happy Friday right back at ya.<br><br>Xanderella:  Can’t say much about Willow.  Her magic addiction has actually been building up for the past two season, and came to a head in Marti’s episode (which I loved, but heck – drugs are more than a metaphor if you went to school in Santa Cruz).  All I can say is that Willow is in recovery, and recovery is never easy.  <br><br>Comteacher:  I don’t know when Gone will repeat.  UPN has taken to airing repeats from the big shows last season.  Possibly over the summer break?<br><br>The Net Slayerette:  BAP deserved and accepted.  Any chance I could get another one?  ;)  And yeah – I suck too.<br><br>OzLady:  Good guess, but no.  Try again.<br><br>Old One:  An excellent – and appropriate – response.<br><br>Miss Dark Kiss:  I was wondering where that peel got to.  Thanks!<br><br>Belmot:  Aaron Spelling.  Then he PAID to have the chicken and the egg created simultaneously.  And hey – I’m the only one that thinks Tori is extra hot?<br><br>Lil’Bit:  No no no – thank you.<br><br>Lilyana:  I’m still squeaking.  Make it stop!  Make it stop!<br><br>Petrona:  Enjoying season six?  No wallop for you, friend!  Just a great big smooch!<br><br>Natasha:  Pantsless super spy?  And you haven’t sent Tiggy a pic WHY???<br><br>Conor MacManus:  I’ll be in touch.  If you don’t hear from me, e the wonderful goddess that is Tiggy to pass along a message.<br><br>Cushy:  A little knee work is just fine.  <br><br>Cashmere:  Why you saucy little monkey!  Me like!<br><br>Slaughteredlamb:  Nope.  I was just in extra in one of the shows.  But you definitely see me up close.<br><br>Willowschicken_feet:  Wow right back at ya.<br><br> And with that I must fly like an eagle, letting my sweet spirit carry me.  Thanks for watching our little show, folks.  We love what we do here at Buffy Central, and hope the gravy trickles down to all you wonderful people.  Until next week…<br><br>Poof, I say, poof!<br><br>

<dd>Y_slaybelle:  3AM?  What country are you kicking around in?<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Good to know.  <br><br>Squireboy:  Strip off those constricting trousers and go play in the snow.  Show ‘em who’s boss!<br><br>Natasha:  Tiggy is beyond goddess.  If only I lived in the South…<br><br>OldManFan: Hope to see you there.<br><br>Bullseye:  Now THAT’S a name!<br><br>Tiggy:  Come join me in paradise.  You know you wanna.<br><br>Memphis:  Good to see you.<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Rebecca’s hair is past the shoulders, but not super long.<br><br>Huggybuffy: I support no organized sports team.  Especially the Lakers.<br><br>Ergoshakes:  Mmm.  Bedazzled snow angels.  Send me pics.  I haven’t been in the snow in ten years.<br><br>Greeneyes:  Bow to your partner.<br><br>Scourge:  Tralf’s a cutie, eh?  Send that pic in to Tiggy.  All of you – send your pics to Tiggy so I can get a gander at ya.<br><br>Lil’Bit:  I’ll say only this about nekkid Spike:  Dead Things.  Honey Biscuit.  <br><br>Cal:  You know, in my early 20s I did things that were completely out of character.  I felt lost and alone and depressed, like most people in their 20s do.  It was a period of life filled with pain and self-revelation. Just like Buffy’s going through.  And heck – I didn’t even return from the grave.  That’s all I’m saying.<br><br><br><br>Okay, last round, then this bird’s gotta be free.<br><br>

<dd>Tiggy:  Sweet fancy Jesus!  I thought I replied to that e.  Yeah, Sunday’s fine, as long as it’s not too early.  Like early afternoonish?<br><br>Miko:  Mmmm.  Vamp Willow.<br><br>Lilyana:  Squeak squeak!  (Another secret revealed.)<br><br>Prince of Lunacy:  I agree with most of what you said.  But I do think we’ll win a Grammy this year.  Joss and the writers are recording a new version of Showboat that’s gonna knock ‘em dead.<br><br>Natasha:  Cool name.  You wouldn’t be a super spy, would ya?<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Although I have often been drunk by the pool, it wasn’t on 90210.  Any other guesses?<br><br>Comteacher:  Get on with your groove thang.  Don’t let me slow you down.<br><br>Cashmere:  How about two words for Spike in the upcoming eps?  “Honey biscuit.”  ‘Nuff said.<br><br>OzLady:  Nope, wasn’t me.  Try again.<br><br>Newt:  Ah ha!  A 90210 fan!  Get ‘em!  <br><br>Miss Dark Kiss:  I can always use another butt monkey.  You’re in!  Now start peeling those bananas!<br><br>Kiba Rika:  Make sure you lather, rinse, and repeat.  Mmm.  Lather.<br><br>Cushy:  I never spill.  My hand is as constant as the North Star.  Now go help Miss Dark Kiss with the bananas!<br><br>Conor MacManus:  Yeah, it’ll probably have to be an e-mail thing.  We start working on Season 7 here in June.  Plus those Firefly eps’ll need tending to, so I’ll be a bit tied up.<br><br>Petrona:  Spike/Buffy considered a major success.  And in my episode coming up – wait a minute!  Don’t think you can trick me!  Get ‘em, butt monkeys!<br><br>

<dd>Old One:  Rain?  What’s that?  Another 70 degree day here in paradise.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha. (Sorry)<br><br>Lil’Bit:  Love is all you need, baby.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Nope.  The only thing I had in mind when I wrote “All the Way” was “Hey, Dawnie’s all growed up!”  Then I immediately turned myself into the proper authorities.<br><br>Single Malt:  Dead Things.  Hee hee hee.  That’s all I’m saying.<br><br>Mia:  I always laugh, nod, and pretend like I do.  Thanks!<br><br>Scourage:  I’m a wee little man, so I’ve been immortalized in actual size.  And it feels great!<br><br>Original Jessica:  Nice drool.  Send Tiggy a pic of yourself so I can return the favor.<br><br>Egroshakes:  That’s all I get?  Just a normal old hello?  Sniff.  Oh how I long for bedazzled days of old.  <br><br>OldManFan:  The diamond is actually cubic Zarconium.  We’ve got a two-episode arc coming up centering around this.  Lot’s of fun.  Just like my ep.<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Mere can experiment all she wants on itty bitty Steve.  Have you seen her new haircut?  Mama yama!<br><br>Greeneyes:  Ye-hah!<br><br>Newt:  Get back on those toes.  Now spin, baby, spin!<br><br>

<dd>Cashmere:  Ah yes, the negative reactions.  Well, of course they hurt.  We’re only human (most of us, anyway – jury’s still out on Greenberg).  But we also realize that everybody has an opinion.  Usually they balance out.  But yeah, it can be tough on the ego when your ep goes down in flames.  That being said, the Buffy writers all dare to suck.  We’ll push things as far as we can.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.<br><br>Conor McManus:  I’d love to join you, but when is it again?  During the summer?  <br><br>Nails:  You don’t need a fan to buzz.  Just press your lips together and blow.<br><br><br>Hey, last week I mentioned I was an extra on the first season of 90210.  Anybody spot me yet?<br><br>
