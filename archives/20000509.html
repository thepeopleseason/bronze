<DD> Moriah, Angel's real name is Angel.  His mortal name was, hang on... checking... LIAM.  That's it.  Liam.  Liam was his name-o.<BR>
<BR>
Ergo, arcs and stand-alones.  <BR>
<BR>
Now I have to run.  Thanks as always.  See ya soon.<BR>
<BR>
Liam.<BR>
<BR>
Er, Tim.

<DD> Melody, none of us, not one, learned anything from "The Ring."  Well, except maybe it's no fun walking around with a crab on one's head.<BR>
<BR>
Cordy sometimes has visions, sometimes not.<BR>
<BR>
I am personally not planning a crossover.

<DD> margot, thanks for that.  I do sort of remember that discussion.  But we already have more than enough boneless gelatinous masses on staff.  In fact, we just hired two new ones.<BR>
<BR>
Lady, regarding Cordy's fleeing in the first scene of act one: beyond the fact that we had nearly every character and their brother to service in four short acts, I just wrote what I thought would happen.  Cordy's too smart to stick around with Faith roaming loose.

<DD> 'stina, Gunn will be back.  Like, oh, next week.  He's great, isn't he?<BR>
<BR>
Sacrifice a spicey mustard to me and all is forgiven.<BR>
<BR>
The helecopter idea was, let's see, who was that?  Oh, yeah.  Joss.  And not nearly as expensive as you'd think.  <BR>
<BR>
And yes, we are in fact already meeting about season 2 of Angel.<BR>
<BR>
Liam, Liam, Liam.  Leeeeeeee-----uumm.  So there.

<DD> Can anyone believe that Kristen was actually at a seminar presented by myself, David Fury, Jane (the ever fabulous) Espenson and Mere Smith -- and she didn't even come up and intro herself to me???  LIAM, LIAM, LIAM, LIAM.  No song, you say?  Best e-mail it to me, Kristen.

OK, going now--sorry i didn't get to all the questions and bashings..I usually try, but on a clock right now...sorry about that--not that anyone is losing sleep over it.  hope i have a chance to sign on in the next few weeks to see what everyone has to say about when Adam and Riley do that thing, and then Buffy comes and does this thing, which makes The Scoobies do this thing that causes lots of things to happen.  --whoa, i just became Joss for a second there..he always does that crap-don't you hate it?  He does it to us on set too...if he stops by, tell him hi for me and tell him to send me a care package...night everyone..mb

Polgara--I won't go out like that...boxer briefs, and 80% of the time chocolate, but a day of caramel never hurt a soul.  or one without a soul.

Hell,now i can't even get the color to work--just too tired i guess.  if i can't get back online the rest of the season, which is quite possible, I hope everyone enjoys the last few episodes.  I hope that I still get invited to the PBP next year, even though Riley gets....ummm....you all know by now....goodnight friends...and don't forget Mother's Day :)</SMALL>
