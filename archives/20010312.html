<DD>Hi, guys...this is a <i>complete</i> drive-by, so forgive the shameless plug, OK?  Thanks!  =)<BR>
<BR>
For those of you in the SoCal area, I'm doing a production of "Macbeth" at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, and I thought some of you might be interested in coming.  =)  The run is currently guaranteed through April 1st, with the possibility of extending through April 15th.  Call 818-755-8850 for reservations.  The show is every Thursday - Sunday.  (Thurs-Sat at 8pm, Sunday at 7pm)  It's inexpensive, as well.  Tickets are $15 on Fri and Sat, but only $12 on Thurs and Sun.  Also, students, seniors, and groups of ten or more get in to any show for just $10!  FYI, my understudy will be doing the show on 3/22, since I'll be at 14 Below performing with Velvet Chain that night!<BR>
<BR>
Hope you can make it!<BR>
<BR>
~Erika
