<dd>Kestra Troi:  The animated show will start out as a Saturday morning thing on Fox, then start airing every day in the afternoon once we have enough episodes.  You should be hearing more about it as we get closes to the premier around Sept. 2002.<br><br>Tiggy3323:  You suck almost as much as me.  Great Spike stuff coming up.  That’s my one and only clue (at least until you email me).  ;)<br><br>Dumbsaint:  Thanks ever so much for enjoying the timber.  Arhhh!  Infested roots had no deeper meaning.  Honest.  Really.  Stop looking at me!<br><br>Shadoed:  Every now and then a vampire actually knows how to fight.  These give Buffy a run for her money.  Oh, and she kinda filled up on candy on her way over to Spike’s.<br><br>Xanderella:  Thanks so much.  I’m very in touch with my inner 15-year-old girl.  As fpr spoilers – Grrrr!  If I find the leak, I’m a gonna plug it with my bare hands!  Puny leak!<br><br>Immortal:  The animation looks kinda like the Batman animation.  Film Roman, the same company, is doing ours.<br><br>Uhp!  Gotta fly!  Got a meeting.<br><br>

<dd>SLUGGIRL:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You know, I still use that joke here in the office!  I think the Bronzers here are directing you to Tiggy’s email, but if not you can go to her website and e her from there:   http://takeoff.to/deknight          Looking forward to catching up.  Big Steve DeKnight love to ya (Ten seconds!  Whooooo!  Ten seconds!)<br><br>SingleMalt:  SingleMalt=drink=good-god-my-head.  Thanks!<br><br>Enders Wiggins:  Emma is just best, isn’t she?  Let’s see… ep-wise, Espenson is doing 12, Petrie is whipping up 13, I should be taking a crack at 14, and Kirshner’ll be making trouble with 15.  After that – who knows?  Yes, there will be a cast CD of the musical, but it may take awhile before you can get it.  The Studio monkeys are handling it, so it’s like waiting for them to accidentally tap out the complete works of Shakespeare.  Bad Monkey, Bad!<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  Hey gorgeous!  So nice to see you here today.  Yes, I got your e – and I got your letter today.  Really made me smile.  You’re the best.  Sooooo glad you’ll be able to come to the PBP.  And I get to meet your Mom!  Very cool.  Don’t be upset.  Life is good, even when it’s bad.<br><br>Abt:  The sporks are good.  Uh, hey.  What the heck’s a spork?<br><br>Cashmere:  Nah, I’m just trying to make Tiggy jealous.  ;)  No, actually Sluggirl and I were old college chums back in the day.  We kinda lost touch over the years, but now we’ve been reunited.  Such is the power of the Beta Bronze!<br><br>Newt:  Not sure what Joss was referring.  If BTVS and Angel had been on the same network, there may have been an actual crossover, but I also knows Joss thinks Angel is strong enough to stand on its own now.  Plus, that vital bit of Buffy information works so much better when she revealed it to Spike at the end of After Life.<br><br>Generefan.  Yes, it was.  No -wait!  It wasn’t!   Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  (This moment brought to you by Monty Python.)<br><br><br>Okay, one more round and I gotta start working!<br><br>

<dd>Kiba Rika:  No excuse!  Get those off!  Thanks for the kindness.  And I’ll tell Joss he’s a hottie next time I see him (heck, I tell him that every day).<br><br>Mia: Thanks!  No, I won’t be on the Succubus Club next week.  Look for my salty presence after my next ep in Feb.  Monkey shirt?  Sure!  I take a large, cause those simians shrink in the dryer!<br><br>Kwinakian:  Much appreciated.  <br><br>Drunkenfairy: Thanks loads.  I do what I can with what I got (and lovin’s what I got).<br><br>Newt:  Poor Dawn.  But at least she’s got a couple of more episodes before we – uhp!  Never mind.  Forget I was here.<br><br>Cashmere:  Thanks, baby!  We’re breaking ep 13 now, soon to move on to 14 (mine, I think).  I’m finishing up my third animated script, and might squeeze in one more over the Christmas break.<br><br>Lilyana:  Aww, shucks.  Thanks ever so much.<br><br>Selwyn29:  Would love to do a cameo.  Maybe next season.  I really want to play a pantsless demon.  Ahhhh!  Run for your lives!<br><br>Miss Dark Kiss:  Yeah, I noticed.  Nothing escapes my keen sight!<br><br>Jenkins:  Correct!  You share the same name as our delightful ex-demon.<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  No no no! You posting to me made MY day.  Thanks for making me another one.<br><br>

<dd>A special message to SLUGGIRL:  Tina!  Where have you been all these years?  You must email me at my top secret private location (send your email address to Tiggy and she'll forward it to me).  Hope all's well, baby baby!<br><br>

<dd>Happy All Saints Day!<br><br>(It is, right?  I'm never sure.)<br><br>Anyway... I'm murdering time for the moment.  So thought I'd drop in...<br><br>
