<dd>Next time I come here we’re going to play a game and the winner’s going to get a bunch of crap Steve DeKnight left in my office.<br><br>Drlloyd11:  In answer to your question about writers and the fans -- I have worked with and around a lot of writing staffs in my short time here in Hollywood, and in my professional opinion no writing staff has more respect and love for their fans than this group does.  It’s truly extraordinary and it’s one of the many reasons I’m so excited to be here working with these people.  <br><br>Corsa_am:  I hope there’s life after season seven.  I just got here.<br><br>CarpeDi:  Dead.  Or maybe, alive.<br><br>Dudley:  I do, in fact, come from a large group of science types.  They’re all very supportive, but they still have no idea what the hell it is I do.  I swear, they can understand particle physics, but screenwriting, no way.  “You mean the actors don’t just make it up as they go along?”<br><br>SmileyFace:  Since I’ve been a rabid fan from the beginning, I didn’t have to do a lot of prep in terms of familiarizing myself with the show.  But they do have this closet here with lots and lots of copies of every episode on tape, and my first couple weeks I would just walk into that closet and salivate profusely.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Miss Kitty Fantastico might be the next Big Bad.  You heard it here first.  Also, much respect.<br><br>Dachelle:  I would be honored if you were my groupie.<br><br>F.A. Witch: Ahhh Willow.  You have great taste.  In answer to your other question,  I’m obsessed with At the Drive In right now.  I’ve also been on a big Lagwagon kick lately too.  And The Misfits.  I’m really excited for The Vines new album.  (I’m a big music freak, by the way.  You hit the right button.)<br><br>Halfrek:  Don’t worry about me growing up.  Much to my mother’s dismay, it doesn’t look like it will happen anytime soon.<br><br>All right, you magnificent people, I must be going now.  If I missed your question, I’m truly sorry and will try to do better next time – I’m just getting the hang of all this.  It has been an honor to chat with you.  I send my love to you all.<br><br>Goddard out.<br><br>

<dd>Again, sorry about the lag.  Brett Matthews just walked into my office.  Oops, did I just drop another name?  This place is celeb central, I’ll tell you.  <br><br>Adri:  My toothbrush is purple.  And chocolate.  Though caramel’s pretty good.<br><br>Freaking Amazing Witch:  I love all the characters.  I would never pick favorites, but I will say I have a special place in my heart for The Mayor.   I would watch Harry Groener read a phone book.  How ‘bout you?  Favorites?  (Everyone else, feel free to play along as well.)<br><br>Aramina:  I’m wonderful, thanks for asking. Classic movie:  Out of the Past.  Recent movie:  does American Movie count as recent?  Because good lord I love that movie.<br><br>GORGOYLESHEAD:   Not related to the Lost in Space guy.  Though I am related to Robert Goddard, the Father of Modern Rocketry.  That’s sort of the same.<br><br>Dudley, Dachelle, CarpeDi:  Thanks for the warning on Wiggins.  He seemed a little shifty to me.  <br><br>Wiggins: Actually, I’ve been a casual fan of yours for a while now.  Much respect.<br><br>Shadowmagik: When I found out I got the Buffy job I nearly wrecked my car. I’m not kidding you.  Don’t be up for your dream job and drive at the same time, people.  Dangerous combination.<br><br>All right, one or two more rounds and then I’m going to have to jump.<br><br>

<dd>Oh boy, I’m already waaaay behind on everyone’s questions.  Damn that Fury!  Him and his cute little capri pants walking in my office and distracting me…<br><br>Quick word on spoilers:  I would be more than happy to spoil everything for you.  However, I really, really don’t want to get fired.  So let’s give it a few months so I can worm my way in and then BAM!  Spoilers for everyone.<br><br>I will tell you this:  Next season is going to blow you away.  I’m not kidding.  When Joss and Marti laid out the season for me, I nearly wet myself.  It is soooooooo cool.   <br><br>Also, on a somewhat related note, I had a bad bladder problem that day.  So keep that in mind.<br><br>

<dd>Sorry about the lag.  Fury just walked into my office.  He sends his love to all of you.<br><br>Molly:  I always need groupies.  <br><br>Reyna:  Thanks for the love.  The feeling is mutual.   Awww.  Group hug.  And my shorts are black and white today.<br><br>Wiggins:  No relation to Jean-Luc or Paulette.  Will I seriously get chicks if I give you spoilers?<br><br>Thoin:  Fury is wearing capri pants, Greenberg is wearing bermuda shorts, and DeKnight is wearing no shorts at all.<br><br>Xanderella:  I have been a Buffy freak from the beginning.  I’m still wandering in a daze.  And there’s no way I could ever fill DeKnight’s pants.    I mean that in every possible way.  And it’s not like he’s gone, you know.  He’s just downstairs.  <br><br>Golden Age Drew:  Your blitzes were a big hit.  Everyone keeps running into my office yelling, “Are there any more blintzes?!  Are there any more blintzes?!”  Either that, or there’s still a big plate of blintzes sitting in the kitchen.  One of those two things is true.<br><br>That’s the most I’ve ever typed the word “blintzes.”<br><br>

<dd>Xanderella: Well, if we were playing that game where I say that everything I know about life I learned from porn videos, then I guess Angel's ONLY recourse would be to join right in.  But, again, that might just be me.<br><br>Thoin: Gracious.  What part of what I said earned me the first-ever writer bap doled out by Thoin?  I need to know so I can say it again and again and again...!<br><br>Guys, seriously, I want to start a campaign where I get to be one of Out Magazine's Top Ten Men We Love.  I think Bruce Vilanch and Michael Musto have hogged the spotlight long enough.<br><br>Drew, I'm totally here for you, bro.  Have fun, and remember, don't tell anyone about how we're killing off... oh, wait.<br><br>

<dd>DrLloyd: But I WANT voodoo dolls made out of me, don’t you know?  But I would never kid you guys.  I might be cagey with my answers (go back and look at what I’ve said in the past and find a single lie, I dares ya), but I would never kid.  And so I feel it’s important to set the record straight right now, come clean once and for all and put the debate to rest.  You guys, it’s true.  Xander and Spike ARE going to become domestic partners next season.<br><br>OldManFan: Howdy back!  <br><br>Shadow: Sorry the gig didn’t work out, it’s a tough business, I tell ya... luckily I went to law school first, so I didn’t have a soul to sell by the time I arrived...<br><br>Guys, I'm gonna skedaddle after one more round and leave you in the very capable hands of Mr. Goddard.<br><br>

<dd>Oh boy, it’s going to be hard to keep up with everyone.  I apologize in advance if I miss any of you.  It wasn’t intentional.  Unless Greenberg asks me questions.  Those I’ll snub.<br><br>Adri:  Chocolates are on the way.  And, I happen to be wearing a hot pink thong right now.  Let’s see if I can get this webcam working…<br><br>Dachelle:  Thanks for filling me in on the custom.  Okay, here’s exactly what’s going to happen this season.  Just, please, PLEASE, don’t tell anyone I told you, okay?  Wait… nobody else is reading this, right?  <br><br>Tiggy:  I plan on livening up the show by making it more Caroline-In-The-City-like.  I mean, that show was hilarious, right? <br><br>Shadow:  I grew up in lovely Los Alamos, New Mexico.  Went to college in Colorado.  Came out here shortly thereafter.  Wrote some television spec scripts, one of which found its way over here, and then presto!  Buffy writer.  That’s the extraordinarily abbreviated version, anyway.<br><br>

<dd>Shadow: I will be the ship’s cruise director.  Oh, wait, that’s just in my fan fic.  I’m writing an episode of Firefly currently slated as Episode 4, and, yes, still working on Buffy concurrently.  It’s a madhouse, I tells ya! And how’d you get to visit our little ship??  And yes, Gale Gand is my personal hero.  I luuuuv her.  And I am going to try the chocolate chip muffins next.<br><br>Holtz: Happy to be your first.  And, look, things go right, you might get a two-for if you stick around.<br><br>Tiggy: Hey!  Yeah, another rookie, but he’s a lot hipper than Dennis Quaid.  He’s learning the ropes pretty quick. <br><br>Dachelle: Thanks.  You clearly have excellent taste.<br><br>Thoin: If only they would WEAR shorts... <br><br>Hey, Nightspirit: Diego will be pleased to hear you’re sending your regards, we’re big fans of his around here, too.<br><br>CarpeDi: I’m doing well, thanks.<br><br>Algerina: Somehow, I always seem to get cast as Rita Moreno.  <br><br>Ultimate Drew: Cool color choice, bro.  Do you think I should have given Nina some blintzes?<br><br>
