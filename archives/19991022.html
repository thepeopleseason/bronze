British Angel: No, that's the X-files VIPs...<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen: Good to see you, too! Gonna be at The Gig? If we can just get FSM to play a show that week, it'll be a Buffy band-fest (just hope they don't play the same night again *g*). Early...Late...it's all relative...<BR>
<BR>
Sachiel: Hmm, Larry King question time! Let's see...Ashley Judd and Madonna spring to mind...oh, wait, you said <i>dinner</i>...*eg*<BR>
<BR>
Dawn's Kiss: We mostly play around LA and environs but we hope to spread out very soon. I'm actually from Kentucky and our drummer lived near St. Louis. <BR>
<BR>
Little Willow: Cape? Yes you deserve a cape! 18+ I believe (alas...).<BR>
<BR>
Earth Girl: Looking forward to seeing you! I hope our name's up there!<BR>

How about "We're all screamin' for ANYA the ex-demon"?<BR>
<BR>
Oki'LLbyte: Thank you very much. No, I always seem to miss the master himself on the board and I've yet to have the pleasure of a RL meeting. Can't wait to get the Buffy soundtrack to get the love theme on CD.</vgreen>
