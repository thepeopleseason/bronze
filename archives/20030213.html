<dd>well, apparently i can only post every five minutes, which totally crimps my deal.<br><br><b>eirefairey</b>: look forward to the question... see you there!<br><br>thanks, both <b>melusine</b> and <b>faithx5</b>. and thanks to you, too, <b>strangestgirl</b>.<br><br><b>Dunlin</b>: tertiary. antediluvian.  choleric.  ort. chrysanthememememum.<br><br><small>grumble grumble... question my vocubalury... grumble grumble...</small><br><br>spoilers here: the name of the ep <i>is</i> "Calvary", as in "a great ordeal", i.e., the reveal of you-know-who via the death of the you-know-who-else.  however, there's a strong undercurrent of the idea of "cavalry", too, this all-too-human yearning to be swooped in and saved when things are at their very worst... which, naturally, in the Jossverse means they're going to get <i>more</i> worse <small>( ? )</small> than you ever thought possible. anyway, i liked<br> the double meaning.<br><br>-mere-<br>sigJTT<br><br>

<dd>much as i hate to disappoint the <b>noodge</b>, the succub*tch line was the honey's.  St. Cordelia and Watchtower were my Bronzer shoutouts --  whassup, my homies?  reppin' the 310.... <small>which is just as whitebread and pathetic as it sounds.  i just don't understand how that Eminem fella pulls it off...</small><br><br>
