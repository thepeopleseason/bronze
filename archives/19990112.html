Hi and Bye to <b>Cosmic Bob!</b>  (I consider myslef bugged.)  =)<BR>
<b>ripley:</b>  We will be doing almost entirely new stuff, actually!  Well, at least half the set.<BR>
<b>Sonrisa:</b>  Yes, I really like them.  I have thier first album, too.  Bought it when I first heard their cover of "I Will Survive."  I think that was '96!  Anyway, they're cool.<BR>
Hi and bye to <b>Labrynth!</b><BR>

<DD><b>AjO:</b>  LOL!  No, no, no...I haven't played a video game since the 80's!  I meant board games.  Scrabble, chess, Pictionary, Scattergories, Trivial Pursuit, etc.  hehehe

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Sure, you can order those direct, as well.  E-mail me.  (LOL about it being difficult to bring a convo around to music!  That's all my friends and I ever talk about!!  hehehe)<BR>
<b>Fatima:</b>  Well, I look forward to meeting all you cool people, as well!  And singing is my fav thing to do, so I should have a great time.<BR>
<b>CHRIS:</b>  Cool!  I'm OK, thanks.  Getting over a very bad cold.<BR>

<DD><b>aardwolfe:</b>  Well, I'm bummed for you that you can't make it.  But like you said, the getting-paid-every-two-weeks part kinda mitigates the pain, yes?<BR>
<BR>
I'mgonna get going here in a sec...  My e-mail addy's Erika@velvetchain.com, if you need to reach me for something.  (Or just feel like sending an e-mail!)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Horizon:</b>  Cool!  =)<BR>
<b>Jonathan H.:</b>  Why don't you e-mail me, and I'll send you all the details in a day or so?  My addy's on this post.  And yes, I'll send you stickers.  I'll even sign the CD for you, if you like.  Just remind me to do it in your e-mail.<BR>
<b>MTVA:</b>  LOL...well, I'll probably be rehearsing both those nights, but you never know.  (I certainly hope our performance will be memorable, even through an alcoholic haze!)<BR>
Hiya, <b>Belmont!</b><BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Hi!  Nice to see you.  So sorry about the delay on the Cd's...but your patience is much appreciated.  And when's the Spike ep on????  (I've been out of the loop.)<BR>
<b>KAM:</b>  Cool...I'll read it when I get home.  How are you?

<DD><b>Yooper:</b>  Cool!  Glad you like it.  =)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, of course I encourage everyone to get a t-shirt.  They're very cool-looking, actually.  IMHO, that is.<BR>
<b>Jonathan H.</b>  Oh, and to answer your earlier q, no tour plans at all right now...but I would LOVE to tour Europe.  Maybe someday...

<DD><b>Earth Girl:</b>  Cool!  Well, I hope he said good things about me!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Moriah:</b>  OK...I'll keep it in mind!  (I may have to work the next day...which would SUCK, but we'll see...)<BR>
<b>VT:</b>  Yep, lovely, nifty, spiffy t-shirts!  Might want to have a little extra "souvenir" money on had, eh?

<DD><b>Jonathan H.</b>  Actually, ordering straight from us is better, and I can cut you a deal if you do that.  We will be receiving another 500 CD's in the next week or so, so there shouldn't be problem.  (If you order from CDnow or something, we never see the money.  Which I don't quite understand...it's our label's arrangement, I guess.)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, say hi to <b>Blueronin</b> for me, OK?<BR>
<b>Buffyxoxo:</b>  Welcome!  You probably don't know who I am, so let me tell you.  I'm the singer of Velvet Chain, a band that was on Buffy, (NKABOTFD) and we've played for the cast's wrap party, etc.  We're also playing at the official party for the Bronze on Feb 6th, which we're looking forward to!

<DD><b>TexasWook:</b>  Nope, I was gone by then.  But I lived in Strong for three years...NOT by choice.  (Damn lottery system), and then I lived in Jewett.<BR>

<DD>Hi, <b>Moriah!</b><BR>
<b>EverDawn:</b>  So glad to hear it!  Cool.  (We've been backordered for so long...I'm glad you were one of the lucky ones who got a CD before the shortage started!)<BR>
<b>Jonathan H:</b>  Would you believe I'm not sure of the answer right now?  I think it's $11.95 for the CD, $8 for the t-shirt, and $5 to ship to England...but I'm not 100% positive.  Are you going to be ordering directly from us, or through our website?<BR>
<b>MTVA:</b>  Hmmmm...perhaps!  Although I never socialize before a show.  I'm weird that way.  My voice, etc.  But afterwards, sure!<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>Aww...I was missed?  That's sweet.  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Bruce's Mom:</b>  Well, mine were very nice, since I was with my folks, but it was COLD, and I got sick.  But I still had a great time.  We ate lots of wonderful food, rented movies, played games, etc.  I was just bummed I couldn't go ice skating like I usually do when I'm home.<BR>
RSO to <b>Sonrisa</b>!  (I'm ok, thanks.)<BR>
<b>OzLady:</b>  Well, thank you very much!  I'm looking forward to it...can't wait to rock the house!

<DD><b>StGermain:</b>  Hi, and thanks for the welcome back!  I was visiting my family in NJ for a couple of weeks, and their dedicated phone line for the computer got knocked out by a storm...took FOREVER To fix.  (My Mom was very annoyed.)  Anyway, it's nice to be back.  How are you?
