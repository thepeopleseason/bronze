<DD>OK, I'm really only here to say a more proper and polite goodbye, and to answer a couple things I saw while scrolling briefly...<BR>
<BR>
<b>ukbuffyfan:</b>  Thank you very much!  You should visit our site sometime.  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<BR>
<b>Sarah W.:</b>  Hi!  And bye...  I believe I received an order from you today!  If that <i>was</i> you, (Sarah W. in TX?)be happy in the knowledge that it's being shipped this afternoon.  =)<BR>
<b>shehawken:</b>  You have e.<BR>
<b>Blondymu:</b>  Well, hello, and I will say hi to Thomas for you.  =)<BR>
<b>Anais:</b>  hehe...that's funny, actually.  Jeff (our main writer) <i>hates</i> them.  Or at least, that's what he said the after I bought Static and Silence.  Thinks they're boring, and that her voice is annoying.  (I think he used to like them OK in the 80s, though.)  So, there is no "influence," but hey, if you think there are similarities, I'm not insulted.  I think they're pretty cool.  =)<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Hi!  And bye...and I got your e-, but couldn't see your pic for some reason.  =(<BR>
<b>Manx:</b>  No worries, and thanks!<BR>
<b>Labrynth:</b> That is so cool of you.  Let me ask my mom, first, and if for some reason she can't, I'll take you up on that, OK?<BR>
<BR>
OK, I've really really got to go.  Bye!<BR>
<BR>
Erika

<DD>I know I'm not really reponding to people!  I apologize profusely.  Never post while doing 6 other things....it's a bad idea.  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Manx:</b>  Cool!  Can I ask a favor though?  you misspelled my name throughout the site.  hehe.  It's Erika.  Not Erica.  =)  Also, the one pic of me with my arms around a guy?  well, that's Jeff Stacy, the bass player and primary writer of Velvet Chain, so could you change that heading to Erika and Jeff instead of just Erika?  I'd appreciate it!<BR>
<BR>
OK, off to work some, will be back shortly, I'm sure...

<DD>Thanks for all the sympathy everyone.  =)  My Mom will tape it for me, I'm sure.  No worries.<BR>
<BR>
As for the quiz...I didn't mean to put a question mark before my 1983 answer.  I'm pretty sure.  'Cause 1982 is only ONE year after Raiders of the Lost Ark, and that's just too soon for a sequel, IMHO.  hehehe...
