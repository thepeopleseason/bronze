These are my goodnights'''was just going to do a drive by to tell everyone i didn't do a drive-off-the-side-of-the-road, as i was told was posted, and ended up hanging with you all for a while--i've missed doing it!  You guys are all great--even you Laine, and you Jamie--:)<BR>
Thanks for all the great comments, questions, compliments, insults, critiques, inquiries, songs, webpages, pictures, words to Joss about Riley LIVING...i'm in for the Espensen list--she knows I love her, I stalk her on set practically.<BR>
OK, back to saying goodnight---once again, you all made my weekend--and I had a great weekend so that was hard to do--get some sleep, go study, talk behind my back--you know, do whatever comes naturally.  Thanks again--see you tues night...in your living room.

Hugs to all--except Laine, who hates me.  And Rile.  But loves Faith.  Well, since Riley slept with Faith, you like Faith, and I play Riley, by the transitive property, you should like me.<BR>
Big hugs to the two greens in my life :)<BR>
REDHEAD--of course you can run the fingers thru it--sorry i missed the last posts--slow at keeping up and i miss many of them..again apologies...you may want me to shampoo first though...<BR>
Jen-Pooh--How dare you?!?!  what do you mean I'm not god's gift to...oh, i mean, thanks, I'm a sweet guy. really.<BR>
Casey--NK--what up smoothies?  (trying to be cool, just came up with that word--didn't mean to make you both sound like a frozen yogurt drink)<BR>
Alaric--ahh the jedi mind trick--i like your style.....but being a dumb actor, i have no reply..<BR>
Marty and Kate--I agree with you both 100%--that has been the best part of the season for me--selfishly speaking of course..thanks XOXO

OK, been a couple of posts about the self-depricating comments--thanks for the boost and nice words to all, but that is just my sense of humor.  I actually have had past problems with my confidence, so when you have high levels of confidence and have been disliked for it, you just crack jokes about yourself.  So kind of you all to comment on it, but know i do not have an esteem problem--after all, I'm tall.  And I wear camoflauge as work attire.

The Huntress---sorry--missed your first few posts--just caught this one...I have yet to open a letter from you, but just got some thursday i have yet to open, so i would assume it is in there...i will take a look later this week.  I know of your efforts and can't help but feeling indebted--almost uncomfortable (take that in a good way) b/c I'm not so hot at taking compliments and such...please know how much i appreciate what you have done, and continue to do for me, and us.  No BS--I hope this doesn't read like some standard answer i give...

Spaz--loving your honesty, craving your acceptance...<BR>
LMO--tough one to answer..giving it a colorful shot..umm..not the best to ask for advice, and hope this doesn't come out all "Marc knows everything", but...accomplishing something...well, when you love what you are trying to accomplish, then the motivation is easy.  So i am assuming you need to accomplish something you don't necessarily love.  That being the case, I always tricked myself into thinking I cared about it, or better yet, tied it to the things i did love.  for instance, I didn't want to read Crime and Punishment either, like gurlgreen, but understood that if i didn't, I'd get an "F" in class, which would make me ineligible for basketball, which would piss me off by taking me away from what I loved to do.  That was long winded, and maybe alittle psychotic, but I always found a way to tie the things I don't like doing, to the things I did like doing.  Does this help at all?<BR>
OK...

OK, how many notes to we need to excuse everyone from schoolwork?  I think I counted about 5...<BR>
Devil...that is somewhat accurate...where are you in law school?  I did watch the movie the night before the test, but it wasn't until much later that the realization hit me on what that meant...did that make sense?

Hey all--been way too long huh?  Well, I just wanted to thank those who let me know about my disabling car accident I guess I had this weekend.  That was a shock to read.  And while many pro-Angel/anti-Riley fans may have wished such a fate on me (just kidding, i hope) I can assure you that both me, and my car, are intact.  Of course, now I feel that I am jinxing myself...
