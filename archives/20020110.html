<dd>wolfguard - The writer's of the eps create the titles, sometimes with an assist.  Somebody might blurt something out during a story meeting and another will say "there's your title."  <br><br>The one-word title thing was just something that happened.  It seemed right to do, Wrecked, Smashed and Gone back to back.<br><br>ducky - Yes.  I will never write and direct another thing again.  I'm going back to my first love: midget wrestling.<br><br>Epiphany - None that I'm aware of.  Check out the site and let me know.<br><br>Sorry.  MS. Marlowe.<br><br>

<dd>Net Slayerette - White.  Like my porcelin skin.<br><br>bhd - Toyota Avalon.  Silvery green.  Like my porcelin teeth.<br><br>Hey, Allyson.  Sorry you've been hating the show.  <br><br>CM - Thick?  No, only my skull.  My skin's like tissue paper.  And porcelin white.  (Somebody stop me!)<br><br><br>Dora - Tara's already dead.  She died off-screen.  The others haven't found the body yet.<br><br>

<dd>Hey, about the Buffy/Spike thing... My stance is the same as ever.  But I'm gold with the context we've been working with.  Buffy is in a dark, screwed up place.  Boinking her way through it with Spike is supposed to be repellent.  And, of course, erotically twisted.  We're not making statements here.  We're telling stories.  And sometimes heroes go through dar, screwed up places before coming out the other side.  Just saying...<br><br>To all of you who've had nice things to say about my first foray behind the camera (and to those who recognize how difficult the endeavor was, Mr. Marlowe), I thank you very much.<br><br>

<dd>Megdalen - Willow already knows the diamond's in the gun  She saw the plans.  Didn't think there was a need to make that more explicit.<br><br>DeAn - That would be Joss.  Via John King, who finds a few songs that might work, then Joss (with Marti) does the picking.<br><br>Dunlin - Don't know yet.  Will be 18, 19, 21 or 22.<br><br>hostile 17 - The truth is we wanted to give Sarah some time off after a few REALLY tough eps.  Ironically, her work was spread out over six days so she didn't get that much time off, after all.<br><br>greenlion - That would be from my tiny brain.<br><br>Xanderella - Impossible.<br><br>

<dd>Xanderella - Well, if Joss is Warren (a dubious theory), I guess one could consider me Jonathan, though Sarah Michelle is convinced the Mustard Guy is Andrew's father.<br><br>And Xander just cannot imagine Buffy having a relationship with Spike.  I suppose deep denial is the best way to put it.  The idea of them hooking up is preposterous to him (ahem, as well as some others).<br><br>hostile 17 - What, you don't find the evil nerd trio terrifying?!<br><br>

<dd>Sarah's carl -- Whether or not Buffy was too cruel to the SW is debatable (the woman did threaten to have her sister taken away from her based on several misunderstandings) but even if she was, the point was to show that Buffy (disenfranchised from the world as she's been) acting out of character when she became invisible.  No rules, no guilt...<br><br>Thank you, Zeus and greenlion.  As I said before, the ep. was a romp and light-hearted diversion...  A lark.  <br><br>And you're right, Downtown... I doubt I'm here, too.<br><br>

<dd>For those who doubt, I'm here to say Joss is every bit around.  Every day.  The ship is still being steered by him, so quit speculating otherwise.<br><br>

<dd>DeAN - Hardcore, but funny.  I mean, it was just James alone under a sheet.  C'mon.  Where's the harm I ask you in a man doing push-ups in bed.<br><br>
