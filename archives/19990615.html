Straw "inquisitive" Berries - Joss hasn't to my knowledge picked a theme yet.  I'm still working on it.  Although I can tell you it probably won' be opera.  Emmy nominations come out July... 20 somethingth.  Whatever it is it's the day before I renegotiate my contract  :)<BR>

Hi WW, gazoo, darkhorse<BR>
<BR>
Haven - Inasmuch as one can talk about music in that way, yes.  SPOILER MAYBE The challenge was to combine violence with romanticism.  Originally what I wrote was a shade too demonic; he asked me to soften it a bit with a little piano.  SPOILER MAYBE<BR>
<BR>
kugelmass - Duel of the Fates got me very excited, but the rest of it (like the movie) didn't quite live up to my expectations.  JW seemed a little uninspired.  Then again uninspired JW kicks anyone else's ass anyway.  Plus there was the not stopping ever.

Hi Ron, thy Slayer, I'm a day away from being done with my current project "Caracara"... then it's a vacation (Spain).<BR>
<BR>
Hi Jasmen, Angle Man, Missi.<BR>
<BR>
ripley - I think they just started shooting "Angel" yesterday.  Which would mean my involvement could start soon... I'm thinking late July.  Hopefully not while I'm in Spain unless it's "Sombrero Angel" we're talking about.
