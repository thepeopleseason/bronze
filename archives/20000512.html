<DD>OK, I'm outta here...<BR>
<BR>
Before I go, I will begin singing one last song for you guys, OK?  How about something really pretty?  *ahem*  <i>You've come around to see me lately, more often than you do...is the same thing eating you?  You've been so down and dusty maybe you can finally see the truth...it was never right for you, there's no more you can do.  So I say, Fall away from your love.  I say, Fall away...</i>  (Fall Away, by Velvet Chain, 2000)<BR>
<BR>
Sorry I was here so briefly...bye!<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
So far, a quiet hiatus.  just redoing my house and visting my sis at school.  but still really excited about this film I did last year called Hollywood PA.  My fiend directed it ( his first movie!) and I just know its gonna rock when they're done editing it!  So that's my *shameless* plug!

<DD>  One more hello to Buffy guy ( so he can die happily).  I just wanted to say that whatever you are ( gay or straight) (religious or not)  There's room for us all here on this really big flying ball of rock and dirt.<BR>
<BR>
I know that playing tara has been an experience for me, so I'm sure it's been "interetsing' for the rest of you guys.  I mena, i'm straight (sorry girls - just a thing for hairy chest;)  and at the moment a non practicing jew who's grandparents are born again christians ( they don't know tara's a lesbian yet).  So believe me, I have a lot of issues to deal with about this stuff too.  just stick with the Willow/Tara storyline and think happy thoughts for Sunnydale's "alternative" couple.  love is love no matter what gender or animal you may be!!

The wicca stuff with Aly   was strange at first, but she's such a  dear, she made ME feel totally at ease.  And if you gotta be a lesbian, aren't too many people better to do some 'splorin with than Aly  !

<DD>  Weirdly enough, I was totally interested in Wicca when I was younger.  There was this cool book by STARHAWK - total wicca queen- and it was really interesting to read how Earth based Wicca is.  More like an environmental- love your fellow human being (even if she is dating Willow the hottie!) - kinda religion...  Plus read so much sci-fi/mythology stuff when I was a kid...
