<b>for other peeps</b>: my episode will be number four, which means, barring reruns (and i don't <i>think</i> we have any between now and then, but i could be wrong), that means my ep airs three weeks from yesterday.  woo-dee-hoo-hoo!

<BR>
<small>Eiddileg: i think, once Drac realized Buffy "wasn't havin' it", he decided to do that thing where he was gone. and yes, the "dusting/misting" was a *tad* on the confusing side, but what with the mist reforming, the re-staking, and then the aborted re-reforming... methinks Drac had had enough of the Buffster. why tempt stake-age when there are millions of other simpering waifs to enthrall?  just my two cents, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Joey: yay!  go punch things!  i will punch things tomorrow!  and there will be general punching and kicking things nationwide! and me? a devil child?  why, i have no idea where you could've -- okay.  fine.  what gave it away? the severed baby heads?<BR>
<BR>
Dangelus: uh, i don't know about the whole story-pitching thing.  as far as i know, both shows kind of frown on unsolicited ideas.  i mean, i've been here for four months, yet they still clap their hands over their ears and shout, "Run away! Run away!" whenever *i* have an idea...<BR>
<BR>
Matt the Bruins fan: interesting idea about Dracula being the actual embodiment OF the fictional character. i think (i *think*) the intention was that he's an actual *person* who's become this larger-than-life legend [in a way, kinda like Buffy herself].  but it's a cool idea, nonetheless.<BR>
<BR>
Circe: haven't checked my e- in, like, three days. i am of the rampant suck. will try to end current reign of slackerhood and do so tonight.<BR>
<BR>
hi DavidFan!<BR>
<BR>
'stina: yes, but would a drag night really make all that much difference in bar like that?  (although i have to confess my shameful titillation at the idea of Cordy in drag. i think she'd be HOT!)  but seriously, with all the horns and hooves and various mucus membranes in evidence, would a feather boa make *that* much difference?</small><BR>

<b>SPOILED THINGIES</b><BR>

<BR>
<small><b>KAM</b>mie: believe me, i'm right there with you. any Faith at all = GOOD. especially when she says something all manly like, "She lives to tell the tale.  I took the knife away, and I can't say much for the wrist it came in, but..."<BR>
<BR>
on a different note, i also think we need to see more of Caritas, its wonderful Host (FYI -- that's the character's name), and more groovin' -- albeit painful -- tunes.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Narrator</b>: okay, here's *my* personal perceived perception, per se: Buffy didn't actually *dust* Drac -- she staked AT him, but before she could hit home, Drac "dusted/misted" himself, so he could reform later.  he reforms, they play the gag again, and then she says, "I'm standing RIGHT HERE." and the mist moves elsewhere. now, i do not speak with any foreknowledge, but it would be my *assumption* that Drac, seeing that Buffy is no longer interested in being his Dark Princess (bator), went on his gothy way.  Marti could post and completely destroy my theory, but that's where i was left, as a fan, at the end of the eppy.<BR>
<BR>
<b>andyourlittledogtoo</b>: thanks!  i'm so excited -- only three more weeks!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Meeby</b>: i don't really know what the deal was there. some scenes he looked fine in, and some scenes he looked... well... "less than fine". like maybe he'd stuck his head in a flour bin. as i said before, i'm torn between "hypnohottie" and "Peking opera".<BR>
<BR>
<b>RTBS</b>: nice to see you, too! and yes, i'll always be your champion, Ruffy. but, uh... you don't happen to be six months pregnant or anything, are you? 'cause that would be... yar.<BR>

<b>Circe</b>: i'm evyihl, like the devyihl. i know many things, my noodge -- many, many things.  eeeeheeheeheeheehee!</small><BR>
