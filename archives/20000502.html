<DD> Dante: There are many recorded intaances of homosexual behavior in animals and about 3 books on the subject. Check your facts before you go quoting.

<DD> Sarr: Mel Brooks is a bully - a fun one, but a bully nonetheless. How much more fun to work with a genious who is also a nic guy!

<DD> SOLO84: Thanks.<BR>
Elliot: I agree in general.<BR>
Hot Damn: To bring Ellen's name into this little side light on Buffy is abserd in general. You can't compare them, though I understand your concern - sit back and relax, I'm sure that's not the writer's idea of the show.

<DD> Hot Damn: Really - Ellen hadf a lead character who was gay. Can you really relate to that and Buffy? Joss is in control and you need to have faith that there is no gay pride parade in the future. Simply a dignified respect for differences. Is that such a controvercy? Buffy is a very gay frienbdly set ant there are lots of us on the crew and all are happy with tohe portrayal Joss has decided upon.<BR>
Gazoo: The tattoo is the same, just a differtent make-up artist...<BR>
Wolfsbane: Yes, the open head thing was Joss's idea - very graphic!

<DD>  Okay, Dragny, the truth is Doyle left the show because he died in a herocial fashion while giving his life to save others.  <BR>
<BR>
After that, we found him harder to write for, what with the flesh having been melted from him and all.  <BR>
<BR>
Okay, Bronzers, must go.  Work in the am.  Be well.

<DD> Lady, I shall not crow.  I will, however, tell you that Joss loved the alchemists joke in the CoW scene.<BR>
<BR>
And I sort of liked the Mulder/Scully run.<BR>
And whoever was shocked by Wesley with a cow... I'm still chuckling.

<DD> You know I get lost in this board very easily.  Thanks for all the kind words.  Hello to all the Aussies.  I just want to say... whoops... damn.  I've gone and killed Doyle again.  Someone get me a broom.

<DD> Rather doubt we'll be shooting an Angel ep in Down Under anytime soon.  Though I lived in NZ for a year and would love to go back your way.<BR>
<BR>
Faith's last name is, uh, I mean, it's... she's from... someplace.  I'm nearly sure of it.<BR>
<BR>
Joss breaks all stories with us.  For this ep, we each took scenes and married them in the end.  Having my name in a co-written with Joss Whedon is a particular pleasure for me.  Be sure I'm screen capping that one and framing it.

<DD> Joss' idea for the big Buffy/Angel punch, if memory serves.  (Buffy/Angel Punch?  yes, but just half a cup, please.  I'm driving.)  Kate will be back next year, that's the plan.  And Wes getting some action?  Hmmm.  There's a thought.

<DD> Dunno if Eliza did the college thing.  And an Emmy -- yes!  Give the girl and Emmy for 5x5, or even this'n.  In fact, Emmy's all around!  I'm buying.

<DD> How come no one's commented on our shocking revelation of Wesley's heterosexuality?  I'm just baffled.
