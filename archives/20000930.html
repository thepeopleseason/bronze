<DD>Personally, i think the ad "There is only one Angel" is pretty catchy.  The original campaign, "Oh God Please Please We Don't Have That Many Hits And Those Bastards, Those @#$%$%#@ers at Fox Counter Program The Same Genre And The Same TITLE, Plus Look At All Money They've Thrown Into The Campaign And We Blew All Ours On Dawson's Creek, Oh God Oh God, But Our Show's REALLY GOOD, No I Swear, Oh Man..." just seemed kind of desperate.

<DD>As to Aly  's make-up, I totally agree.  They wanted to try something different, I didn't think it would work but like a wuss said okay.. we'll look at the footage and see if it's a problem.  And yes, it was way over the top.  She looked like a PAINTED HOOR!  Aly   is so beautiful, it's just not nessa.  So we're toning it down again.  (I really liked the part of the story where I was right about everything..  That was cool.)

<DD>Angle -- I did, and had already gotten another letter on the subject.  Am in ponder.  Meanwhilst, was it not you who restored my color?  Not that you KNOW....  I'm exhausted (no really this time!) from shooting my first ep of the season, ep six.  I don't know what people will think of it but it means a lot to me and does contain (Hey I'm a-spoilerin') the answer to Tara's secret. (!)  Everybody did a beautiful job in it, even though they were getting pages the night before we shot 'em.  (I was writing it as I shot it.  Never, never do this.)  Fun.

<DD>Well, can't really stay.  Just wanted to mention that I think next weeks shows are fairly wonderful.  In fact, I think the ep of ANGEL is the best we've done, truly haunting, truly gonna get it's ass kicked in the ratings by its dark namesake.  'm not worried about the competetion but it's too bad the one time people are SURE to watch the other guy is during Tim Minear's classic.  Am sighing.  (And oddly flatulent.)  (It's possible I could have left that last part out.)

<DD>Sidney, you're new, and you seem like a real fan, but you don't understand the RULES.  People WANT to talk to you, but you haven't undergone the INITIATION.  So go get a tub of margarine, three quartz crystals, a copy of Ladies Home journel and a basset hound.  Then we'll explain the ritual and the fun talkin' will commence!  Trust me.

<DD>Yes!  Yes! I AM that mysterious fan!  Me!  And I do know the color codes, I DO!<BR>
<BR>
Of course, I have very little to say.  But it's in color!
