<dd>So I'm REALLY REALLY going to bed.  Two things:  I actually wasn't aware of the dead/evil lesbian cliche.  I wasn't aware of the 'add a young girl in the fifth season' cliche either.  I think I don't get out much.<br><br>And Thoin, I'd like to call them Mr Wynn and Mr Kidd, respectively.  Sleep now.<br><br><br><br><br>j<br><br>

<dd>All right, you get the "kept Joss From Sleeping"  award.  (The ceremony is televised oct 11th).  Your question is well put, and it's one I've asked since the only things I was writing were for my own 14 year old self to read.  What is my responsiblity?  How dark should I get, how much should every one of my characters represent an ideal or a reality?  How far can you delve into evil before you are actually propagating it?  Is propagating a real word?  These are questions that must be confronted every time out to bat, and every time the decision is different.  We have to delve into unconfortable and even awful places to find the heart of our stories (especially with the horror).  These are fairy tales, not driving manuals.  However, I have a mass audience, I have to show them something besides horror, I have to have values....<br>And so on.  The fact is, if you are worried about these issues, you're probably worried enough.  Too much of our culture today is controlled by people who don't give a rat's *** about their message, who just churn out crap.  I don't like most slasher films because they don't like people -- they're just kill fodder.  Now there's also people preaching one thing while glorifying another, there's what Robin Wood calls the "Incoherent Text" of so many seventies movies, where peace and understanding may be the underlying desire, but horror and violence is the structure -- or the fun.  My favorite example of the incoherent text is DIE HARD, where Buce Willis must learn to e more supportive of his wife -- while systematically stripping away everything (her boss, her workplace, her watch, her NAME) that she has.  The decency running alongide the misogyny there is evident.  I guess the point is, the best texts are incoherent.  They EMBODY the struggle you describe.  Horror is reactionary.  I'm liberal.  But we get along.  And DIE HARD is a great damn flick.<br><br>Did that make any sense?<br><br></dd>

<SMALL>
(Wed May 22 07:02:03 2002)</SMALL><br>
<dd>Seroiusly, that means they know WHERE I am, and everything about me.  So I'd just like to say, this may LOOK like women's lingerie, but it's just a clever swimsuit.  In case I need to swim.<br><br>On to other things.  Which is, Thanks all for your support.  I appreciate the passion of those who criticize me, but it isn't until someone comes to my defense that I realize how much I feel it.  So thanks.  And good night.  <br><br>And if anyone sees Kiba, please explain to her that it's just a clever swimsuit....<br><br><br>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZnow<br><br><br><br>j<br><br></dd>

<dd>Well, I started me quite a brawl over there in UPNLand.  Whoopsie?  I'll just sneak out through here... Sumbuddy sed I only posted there cuz th' UPN FORCED me to, which how they would I'm unclear about, but the sad truth is I just wanted to say hey, let people know I was still in the mix, and I finally remembered my damn password over there.  Anyhoo, here as well but only on th' quick, to say hi.  Never know where people are at but hi to all youse regular types that I know.  Watch all my shows and buy the products advertised in between!  (That was pretty shameless.)  (Seriously, I crossed a line there, I'm sorry.)<br>Bye now!<br><br><br>j<br><br></dd>

<DT><STRONG>over the gay thing, revisited</STRONG><br>
<SMALL>Posted by: <EM>Joss</EM> - May 22, 2002, 2:27 AM</SMALL>
<br>
<DD>Thought I was out, but.... had one more thing to add.  I killed Tara.  Some of you may have been hurt by that.  It very unlikely it was more painful to you than it was to me.  I couldn't even discuss it in story meetings without getting upset, physically.  Which is why I knew it was the right thing to do.  Because stories, as I have so often said, are not about what we WANT.  And I knew some people would be angry with me for destroying the only gay couple on the show, but the idea that I COULDN'T kill Tara because she was gay is as offensive to me as the idea that I DID kill her because she was gay.  Willow's story was not about being gay.   It was about weakness, addiction, loss... the way life hits you in the gut right when you think you're back on your feet.  The course of true love never did run smooth, not on my show.    (only Dennis Franz has suffered more than my characters.)  I love Amber and she knows it.  Eventually, this story will end for all of them.  Hers ended sooner.<br>
<br>
Or did it......?<br>
<br>
Yeah, it did.

<DT><STRONG>exit me, pursued by bear</STRONG><br>
<SMALL>Posted by: <EM>Joss</EM> - May 22, 2002, 2:15 AM</SMALL>
<br>
<DD>There is no bear.  That was a lie.  But I am leaving.  Just wanted to say thanks for watching, y'all come back, etc... also, I read occasionally that people haven't been as happy with this year (actually, I hear that every year), show's not the same... not from eveeryone, but it comes up, and I just wanna say this: Dis not th' Nox.  Say not that I'm not into it, Marti's not getting it done, anything of that sort... Fact is, I'm in this show up to my neck always.  Same With Angel and yup, Firefly too.  And I've read that I've blown off one for the other -- He's over Buffy, Firefly is just a contractual obligation, he didn't even CREATE the Rockford Files, why's he taking credit for it... I've heard it all.  And it ain't necessarily so.  Marti (She of the great brain and great beauty) and I shaped this year very carefully, and while we made mistakes (as we do every year), we made our show.  We explored what we wanted to, said what we meant.  You don't have to like it, but don't think it comes from neglect.  That would give me hurty feelings.  Next year is gonna be the greatest challenge of my life, but I've got all three shows lined up thematically, i've got amazing writers and stupendous casts, I'm excited.  It feels like the beginning.  Joss, year one.<br>
<br>
Just wait.

<DT><STRONG>pt II</STRONG><br>
<SMALL>Posted by: <EM>Joss</EM> - May 22, 2002, 1:56 AM</SMALL>
<br>
<DD>Okay, then.  Feel a little weird about putting that all out there so soon, but I'm sure it was all gonna come out on Ain't-it-spoiled anyhoo, so.... (can you believe the lame fish joke?  and I'm supposed to have THREE shows!  Some's alseep at the wheel, me getting more shows...)<br>
<br>
Soo... I guess there's not much more to say.  'CEPT: We're busting Ass (mostly Fury's, he volunteered, PLEASE don't ask) to put next year into shape and once again, I'm bursting with excitement.  I'm not saying a damn thing (as per usual) but it's an exciting new arc and I may get to shoot a little bit of it in England...  Next year we take it up a notch.  Swear to the Sky Bully.<br>
<br>
yours ever, <br>

<DT><STRONG>Everything that's going to happen</STRONG><br>
<SMALL>Posted by: <EM>Joss</EM> - May 22, 2002, 1:56 AM</SMALL>
<br>
<DD>As people who have been around for a while know, I always like to get on the &quot;net&quot; and reveal aboslutely everything that's going to happen next year.  That way, you don't spend all summer stressing.  Here's the important points:<br>
<br>
1) Buffy will become a &quot;vampire slayer&quot;.  I can't really explain what that means yet, 'cause Doug hasn't explained it to me.  But it seems to point towards ADVENTURE!<br>
<br>
2) Format change:  from now on, the first half hour will be about Buffy FIGURING OUT what the monster is, and the second half hour will be about Sam Waterston PROSECUTING the monster.<br>
<br>
3) We're easing back on the goats.  There've been complaints.<br>
<br>
4) Because of the coincidental movie name issue, we will no longer refer to the kids as the &quot;Scooby&quot; Gang.  They will be known as the &quot;Scooby Doo, The Film, Coming This Christmas To Your Local DVD Store&quot; gang.  Or possibly the &quot;Sharks&quot;.<br>
<br>
5) The gay thing is so passe.  We're over that.  But honestly, that's just the way Clem ACTS.  We're having a talk.<br>
<br>
6) A lot of people were confused at the end when Spike wanted his fish order changed.  SOLE, people.  Jeez.  We HAVE a vampire with a SOUL, you think we're doing that again?<br>
<br>
7) Cardigans, cardigans, cardigans.
