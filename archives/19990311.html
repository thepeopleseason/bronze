<DD>Ooookay, one last post and then off to visit the Dustman.<BR>
<BR>
Hanna and Chelsey, yep, that's me.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow -- and now YOU have reply e, you rockin' one.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man--Of Marvel's titles, I find only the Knights stuff, Cap, Thor and Thunderbolts readable.  they're all cool.  I do read Astro City, when it comes out.  But I have to say that I think No Man's Land is a HUGE waste of a cool idea.  There's endless potential in that story, and they're squandering it.<BR>
<BR>
And on that note . . . zzzzzzzz

<DD>RhodeHazard:  Please do.  I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  No one in any professional situation should ever treat anyone like that.<BR>
<BR>
And now, I must get some sleep.  Good night, all.  Rest easy.  Be well.

<DD>Margot:  thanks for the ego boost.  James and I had a blast and will probably do more Spike & Dru comics down the line.<BR>
<BR>
Ange:  Sorry I missed the PBP.  Hopefully next year.

<DD>Angle Man;  I read a lot of comics.  Love 'em.  Even listing my favorites is hard.  (Used to love Marvel, but they mostly suck now, so I'm a DC boy.)  But let's see . . . Preacher, Hitman, Strangers in Paradise, Bone, The Wretch, Hellboy, Sin City, Transmet, the new Wildcats, Planetary, The Authority, JLA, Titans . .. that's just a few.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow:  Yeah, one each so far in the solo category, plus the YEARBOOK, and then that ther super secret project, which Nancy and I are teaming up on again.

<DD>Slay_Me:  thanks for asking.  I'll be done with the first draft of Sins of the Father, my solo Buffy novel, by April 1st.  Then I'm into the third book in my new YA mystery series for Pocket.

<DD>Angle Man:  Nope.  There are a couple of Wetworks characters, but you don't need any prior knowledge for the one-shot.

<DD>Rhode Hazard, would you care to be more specific about editor and house?  I don't want to pry, but if there's someone that evil out there, I want to know.  You could e me through my site at www.christophergolden.com if you don't want to post it here.

<DD>Wow, went away for a minute, and everybody said such nice things.  I should leave more often!  thanks all for the kind words about the books.  Ghost Roads was pretty crazy, so I'm happy it's being well received.<BR>
<BR>
Myrlin? I guess it was you who asked, but no plans to go to ABA.  Maybe Nancy, but I haven't asked her.<BR>
<BR>
Horizon:  I'm fortunate enought to have read "Enemies" already, and i don't think you guys will be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow:  hey, my hero!  how are you?  Still no word from my Pocket publicist, but I'll keep after her.  Meanwhile, we should talk soon.  And yeah, SUPER COOL book news.  That's ruining my life and making me forget what my family looks like . . . but for good reason.

<DD>VBF: Hi back.<BR>
<BR>
Horizon:  didn't make the PBP, sorry to say.  But things are going great.  Should have some super cool Buffy book news next week.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man:  Thanks.  Yeah, the Origin's late.  Artists.  Sigh.  But on the pos side, Tom S. and I are starting to get some decent comics gigs, including the Wolverine/Punisher mini, a one shot for Wildstorm in May called Night Tribes, and a very cool Batman: Elseworlds that we're about to start work on.

<DD>What promo are we all talking about?  for "earshot?"<BR>
<BR>
CharlieX:  Thanks for the vote of confidence.  And yeah, we're evil.  Believe me, it only gets nuttier from there.<BR>
<BR>
Phil:  The Origin #3 is a little late, but it should be out next week, I think.

Very special SO to my bodyguard, Little Willow, if she's out there.
