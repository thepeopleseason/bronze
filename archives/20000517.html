<DD>Erin - please listen to me about this.  I'll try to explain it somehow and you can tell anyone who wonders tomorrow about it.<BR>
<BR>
Big shocker.  Lied to.  Wow.  Learned stories from other crew guys who don't want to return.  Wow.  "Joss should know this stuff" thinks me.   I call him...<BR>
<BR>
... "He'll call you right back."  Hours.  Days.  He's not gonna call.  He's posting though.  Like  never before.  Hmmm<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Write a story from the heart.  That way all the friends who care about me on the PB will read and know.  So will Joss.  Good idea.  Don't want to upset.  So simply post an url to GET TO IT.  Good.  Don't want to hear about it.  Don't go there.  Dont' discuss.  Makes sense.  Even a Beaver could grasp that concept.<BR>
Seems the only way.  Only people who care will.  Others will keep out of it.  Good deal.<BR>
<BR>
See Joss.  Mocking about my heart felt pain.  Not happy.  Suddenly drop in to say something.  Joss bails.  Try to make him understand and then go back to funboy stuff.<BR>
<BR>
But... some folks won't allow.  Must constantly keep bringing it up.  Reading it on the PB.  Questioning me.  Calling me a liar because "they know" or "the servant didn't tell his side."  What ever.<BR>
<BR>
The pint is it is for those who want to hear of my heart felt feelings about my own personal experiences that happened to me.  That's it.<BR>
<BR>
Don't keep reading it here and then posting to me by saying "why are you posting this?"  Makes sense.  Talk about Willow.  Anything but harrass me about why I dare.  And yes I do and will dare, to answer back by writing my feelings down for the appropriate persons to see.<BR>
<BR>
Not one of those people?  Then don't follow the url.  Just don't do it.  It contains something that you may not like.  Okay.  Not for you.

<DD>Try to control yourself Not-so-Random.  And thanks for posting about me while you think I'm not here.<BR>
<BR>
Sophia can work with Sarah the way all of us have.  Every day.  We go to work.  Do our jobs.  Then we go home and everyone bitchs about her to the spouse.  That's how we do it.  We all do that.  Joss, Jeff, every writer and actor.  Every crew member.  Okay?  <BR>
<BR>
They made a documentary about Roseanne (on the downswing)  One about Brett Butler (same only worse)  and Cybil too.  When the 15 minutes are nearly up they'll do one on SMG I'm sure.  Then you can throw things at the TV instead of me.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you can understand my not so random answers.  I really do.  Oh.  Wait.  Don't wanna know?  Why am I saying this to you?  Then don't ask.  Makes sense.  Sure it does.<BR>
<BR>
Unless you don't really want me to answer.  Unless you just want to post as if you were talking to me just to make a big statement to other people.  You wouldn't do that though.  That'd be...  like you were an attack dog or something.  Don't be that.

<DD>Can someone tell me who these people with the never seen before names are suddenly appearing whenever I log off?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lurking conscience indeed.  <BR>
<BR>
No one has made fun of anyone's "fatherless" situation.  I wrote "fatherless" to point out the fact that this "General" tries to move himself into that vacant spot.  Anyone who can read can understand that.  Sheesh.<BR>
<BR>
I'm fatherless.  My Dad died (like my Mom) during this time at Buffy.  Sarah's Dad is just fine for anyone's information.  <BR>
<BR>
So stop talking to me as if you know anything about the sitch when you don't.  Please.  <BR>
<BR>
Again.  As I posted.  READ AND KNOW THIS WELL:  I posted an url for Joss.  That's Joss Whedon.  I offered it to be read by any of the people WHO CARED so that they  could understand why I was not there.  <BR>
<BR>
The end.<BR>
<BR>
Now if you are not either Joss or one of the people who care about me, then for God's Sake.  Spare yourself and me.  Don't read it.  It's not for you.<BR>
<BR>
And don't start in on me and ask me about it or anything else when I come here UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.  <BR>
<BR>
I do hope that sinks in.  I would say that I'd spell it out.  But I've done that to death.<BR>
<BR>
see above.  again.  just in case it was missed by any who should read it.  memorize for others please.<BR>
<BR>
thanks

<DD>Yikes.  Again.  Already.<BR>
<BR>
Not-so-Random:  I posted the url here so Joss and my friends who cared could see it.  yes, friends.  <BR>
<BR>
Now I could've posted an url to an url that would lead to another url.  Or I could have put it on a page and never posted any url.  Thus lessening the chances that any of these people would go to it.  <BR>
<BR>
Unless I went to each person's home and then why wouldn't I just recite it.  <BR>
<BR>
See what I mean?<BR>
<BR>
**true sigh** <BR>
<BR>
goodnight.  now don't you talk about me.  Shh.  Hold on.<BR>
<BR>
Don't do it.  Hold back.<BR>
<BR>
Keep trying now.  <BR>
<BR>
Good.  That's the way.  Thanks very much for letting me get some sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Feel free to start in tomorrow.  <BR>
<BR>
Don't you make me come back here.<BR>

<DD>Okay Mike.  I'm gonna take off now.<BR>
<BR>
Just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of the people who have shown me kindness during one of the most stressful and shocking times of my life.  <BR>
<BR>
I don't think anyone here is pathetic.  And I'm just as much a geek as the next guy.  Except Brad Grenz.  He's worse than me.<BR>
<BR>
Please tell the attackers that I stood up for myself today to some people who are really not used to that.  And I didn't mean to bust any bubble or tense anyone up.  But like I said to Joss, if you poke me with a stick then I'll have to say something about it.  <BR>
<BR>
Hoping he'll still call.  Probably not.  But that's life in this town.  I tried.<BR>
<BR>
Now on to loftier things.<BR>
<BR>
be good and try to hold back on the cursing, won't you?  family board.<BR>
<BR>
bye bye<BR>

<DD>Mike:  Calm yourself my  old friend.  <BR>
<BR>
In the old Twilight Zone episode where little Billy Mummy wished people into the corn field there was an attitude that I've seen all too often on people's faces.  Lots of tension caused by the resulting stress of that.  <BR>
<BR>
But the people who lived outside the little town couldn't give a rat's behind what little Billy said.  I moved out of town.

"Get up here bitch"  (spoken to a Mom)<BR>

"Those posting board people.  You actually talk to those geeks?  I have issues with them.  Oh please.  That's so pathetic.  Don't you have anything better to do with you time?"  (spoken to me)<BR>

"Can I get any &&^% drugs in here or what? I'm not going till I get what I want!"<BR>
<BR>
Those are direct quotes from someone.  You might know if you were me.  But you are not.  Okay. <BR>

No need to attack. <BR>

<BR>
Okay.  How about if we are actors and no that's too close to home.  Dang!  Should've used the military angle.  But then I'd be accused of attacking poor Riley.  sigh*

<DD>Jimbo - It was very tasteful and from the heart.  It's how I feel.  And yes it hurt to see Joss laugh at me and make fun of it.  So maybe I did get upset.  But with my job gone I've got lots of time to post, post, post.<BR>
<BR>
So I say that next week the show ends with Buffy so...<BR>
<BR>
...naw.  Just messin'.  I shall not SPOIL.  Except to say that Angel is a hottie again next season.  No really.  That part stays that same.  The lime coat doesn't work for me though.  Hope they don't go with that idea.<BR>
<BR>
Unless it's romantic.  Time for Angel to get involved with a cool military chick.  It'll work.

So stop causing trouble here.  I love Lucy Lawless.  Okay.  And I don't care if she's gay, celibate, or humping a producer.  She's a fine actress and I...<BR>

<BR>
Fortunately the Slayer heals fast.  Gone the next day.  Ready to be applyed again.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah was wearing it when the limo brought that sweet girl from Fanatic to see her.  The girl looked at her and Sophia for a minute as if she thought they were cut.  It was cute.  She was really nice.

<BR>
For the record:  Fury and I never had an argument.  Yet that was spread around on the pb for Days on end.  I showed up and spoke to Joss and answered a few questions today.  That's it.  <BR>
<BR>
Didn't bring a "story" here.  Posted an url.  Anyone who wanted could take a peek or not.  I didn't bring it into the PB.  Joss made some comments and I popped in to see.  He popped out.  The end.  Maybe he'll call.  Maybe he'll just crush me with his mighty multi-million dollar machine.  Got no idea.  That's the end.<BR>
<BR>

And could you also tell me what SMG thought about the car we showed her?  Wait.  I already know.  I was there.<BR>

I know Joss phone number.  Yep.  Called it.  He was gonna call back.  Still waiting. One of the crappiest days of my life.  Maybe you can TRY to understand the shock and pain and just drop it.<BR>
<BR>
yes.  Not only is Willow gay, but so is Tara.  (pronounced Teara.  Joss was very clear on that point)<BR>

<DD>Hey ajslayer - Remember  that time that we were eating cake with Sarah and ... no wait.  You weren't there.  <BR>
<BR>
Remeber that time we had a death and we were .... whoa.  You didn't see me and Sarah on that day either.<BR>
<BR>
Oh... The gym we were setting up for the new house.  Remember how I had to buy mine first and then Sarah got the thing from me and she... aw no.  You weren't there.<BR>
<BR>
Didn't I see you at the wedding when Sarah and her Mom and I sat together and discussed the movie deal that someone ... no?<BR>
<BR>
The tears.  The laughing.  The fighting.  The romances.  The whining.  The screaming.  All of these from both Sarah and yours truly.  Often at the same time.  Over all kinds of matters too.   <BR>
<BR>
Not trying to tick you off.  Just saying, hey.  This is my life.  I've been living it.  You've seen some tv shows and read a magazine.  So please don't anyone presume to tell me what it's like to be around SMG.  Oh please don't try that.  That's all I'm saying.  Make-up on.  Make-up off.  Everyday.  See what I mean?  Okay?

<DD>Melody - Please recall that I didn't come here and attack anyone.  I was the one attacked.  All I did was post an url so that if Joss or any of my friends here wanted to understand better, they could read if they liked.<BR>
<BR>
Then I looked and saw I was being  mocked by the one person I had admired in all this.  So I answered him right here.  Why?  It's the only way I can talk to him now.  He won't call me back.  <BR>
<BR>
So that's it really.  Then the questions began.  Tried to answer.  Didn't come to attack.  Tried hard to be nice.  That's really all there is.  <BR>
<BR>
winkerbean - That's one of the nicest things you could say to mean right now.  Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
True that I did have my feelings hurt today by Joss.  Just as he did by my story.  Maybe neither of us really meant to hurt the other.  I know that I didn't.  But I have to be strong here.  It's not that easy for me.  Try to understand.  That's all I can say.<BR>
<BR>
I try to always come on and goof off and make jokes and all.  And that's what I prefer to do.  But when people suddenly pop in that I've never spoken to and write nasty comments about my life.  Then sure, I try to answer as best I can.<BR>
<BR>
I did my thing.  Spoke to Joss.  Laid my story out to him.  Got dissed for my trust.  Okay.  Good enough. I can handle us.  <BR>
<BR>
Now... I have been preoccupied lately I admit.  But I have heard a rumor that Willow may be gay.  Sorry if I missed anything that may have been posted about that.  <BR>
<BR>
... please discuss...

<DD>Just have to post one tiny thing about all this:<BR>
<BR>
I've been coming to the Bronze for three years.  I have met and really like a lot of people here.  I've spent time with many and made real friends.  <BR>
<BR>
I've been working daily with Sarah for three years too.  We've seen the good and bad side of each other.  In other words, I know her.  <BR>
<BR>
You will notice now that I have spoken out that there will be generic people that you may have never seen here before suddenly posting nasty things about me.  That is how a massive publicity machine works.  And making threats about my future employment and claiming that I have no friends here is a part of that.<BR>
<BR>
You'll see this go on for a while.  Some people can't simply let me speak about my own affairs and let it go.  Don't worry.  Most people here are not as stupid as these folks think.<BR>
<BR>
Remember that I said this.<BR>
<BR>
take care,<BR>

Don't worry about next season.  All money and stops will be pulled out to make it great.  That I am certain.  <BR>

<DD>Please understand that "taking the high road" does not mean bending over and taking it.  Everyone has a right to speak out when he's been wronged.  I didn't want to do that here.  I only posted an url and let others know I'd still be around and pop in to talk from time to time. <BR>
<BR>
I actually had tears in my eyes when I wrote that little parable.  It meant something to me.  Maybe when someone else is down they'll understand too. <BR>
<BR>
I want to be nice.  I like nice.  But do not poke me with a pointy stick.  I might actually say something.<BR>
<BR>
The idea of "taking it up behind closed doors" is a good one.  Been there.  No dice when yoiu walk outside and you find the door is locked behind you without a word.  Don't ever be afraid to stand up for yourselves should you turn around and find out you've been had. <BR>
<BR>
Regardless of minions sent to write the "get off the PB" stuff that you may see happen.  It will not change the opinion that I have that I've met and talked with many great people here.  Unlike some.  I do not consider you all to be "outsiders."  I think of you as my neighbors. <BR>
<BR>
That's all.  <BR>
<BR>
On to bigger and loftier things.

<DD>Catherine - Yep.  I agree.  I wanted to be done with that.  I figured that let Joss read the story.  Call if he wants or not.  But I'd be done and could just hang out and talk show stuff without offending anyone.<BR>
<BR>
Then I looked in and saw (what I felt was) the mocking from Joss.  So I responded to him live and in person (on the PB at least) And still ... nothing.  So that's it then I suppose.  No dialogue after three years of busting my butt, working on week ends for nothing and making things happen at the drop of a hat.  Just mockery that I dared to question anything.  <BR>
<BR>
Oh well.  Maybe he is just as human as me.  Or the rest of us here.  (except a lot richer - of course.)  But he must have some understanding deep down for how I feel.  Despite what they say about him, I think he's not a snob.  I think there is a regular guy who just has the same problem with shyness that I had and uses his work to get through it all.  I don't know anymore.<BR>
<BR>
Melody - You are right.  But if the attacked Sophia for me trying to defend myself to Joss, then that would be the cruelest and sickest thing of all.  She is innocent of everything except loving me and taking the punishment (both psychologically and physically) that this show brings her.  Getting rid of her for no reason would be really something disgusting.  They can't be that cold-blooded.  She's not the one who dared to speak back.  It was me.  <BR>
<BR>
I hear that Hef needs a fluffer over a Playboy Productions.  I have to go massage my hand now.*<BR>
<BR>
again that's me trying to be there with the jokes.  sigh*  I should have asked Joss to let me see that library of his when I had the chance.

<BR>
<BR>
Hell I'm just kidding.  Don't worry.  No spoilers from me. <BR>
<BR>
I'm just as interested as anyone to see how Joss put that episode together.  I usually have a handle on what he is doing and understand why he is doing something with the characters.  Often it's a great surprise and I always enjoyed the scripts.  But this one is a mystery to most everyone who worked on it.  An odd episode.  What does it all mean?   Are their any clues for next season?  I have no idea.  But I'll be watching just the same.

<DD>btw - That bolt thing.  Since they wanted me to suddenly be the one to connect the seat belts to the eyebolts, then if something had happened it would have appeared to be my fault.  <BR>
<BR>
One of my car stunt guys told me that this kind of thing happens sometimes, but usually out of the country.  I'd never seen it before with my own eyes.  That guy has a lot of hate going.  It started back when I flew the REPTILE BOY on wires I was told.  I'm just learning about this stuff as I go as many of the crew have left the show now and can confide things to me that they were afraid to when they were working there with these people.

<DD>onlyinmyMIND - Okay.  Many creepy things happened to me throughout the season.  EXAMPLE: I'd meet with certain people and tell them what we were working on as far as stunt went so that we could all be on the same page.  Then they would go and tell the executive producer that I was "not communicating" and that they had not heard from me at all.  Even when I'd put it in writing and leave it in someone's office after talking to them, the word I got was that "he never told me anything."  How could I prove otherwise?  If a group of people say someting then  it must be true.  Right?  Most of this I never knew about till much later.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't even know that the fx guy had been trying to get others to go along with him to help get me fired until I found out from others.  It had been going on a long time and I didn't even know it.<BR>
<BR>
We crashed a car into an armored vehicle.  My stunt guys called me over to look at something.  Normally the fx guys would hook the seat belts I gave them into the car.  This time they had only put the bolts in and told me to do it.  So I did.  One of my guys had a funny feeling and crawled under to look.  He saw that the driver side bolts were solid.  But the passenger side bolts (my side of the car)were loosened to the very tip.  If I had simply hooked onto that I could have been really hurt.  This never, ever happens by accident.  It's impossible.<BR>
<BR>
The DP had too much to drink and said that he wanted me gone because he should be the only one to call the shots.  Some of his camera guys would come to me and this drove him crazy.  I had no idea.  I was simply trying to do the job I've always done.<BR>
<BR>
There's tons more.  Some of it is really bad.  I can't even print the things that I personally walked up behind and listened in on.  (Pays to be a Ninja - eh?)  <BR>
<BR>
Wish I could have talked to Joss someway sooner.  I was told not to worry, that it was all okay.  That was a lie to keep me working hard till the end of the season.<BR>
<BR>
Lots o' little things like that.  Nothing to be concerned about.  Uh... much.

<DD>Well that's it then.  Knew Joss wouldn't call me back.  (Though I was told he would) So I tried in the only way I knew how to get a story to him without telling the real awful details.  Some of which could have really gotten some people hurt.  And I mean in a physical way.  <BR>
<BR>
No making myself appear "noble" either. Just trying to let HIM know how I feel.  Using the only avenue open to me now.  <BR>
<BR>
So let's make the PB safe for democracy and blind hero worship or anything else, okay?  I only want to have fun and talk about stunts.  All of the work that I put into 66 episodes of television will help to make some people very, very wealthy.  And that's just what it was supposed to do.  That should count for something.  <BR>
<BR>
The job may disappear because of a small group of liars, but the work is there and will be seen all over the world.  So I can still be proud of that.  <BR>
Maybe when Joss calms down he can talk to me like a regular guy.  I'm not from a Royal Family.  But  I'm not sheep dung either.  So I don't like being treated like it.  <BR>
Maybe he can put himself in my place and understand just how pissed off one can get after what I've been through.  And he can understand why one so lowly as me would dare to write such a parable.  My God.  How dare I.<BR>
<BR>
Try to have a heart Joss and remember what it's like to be under Roseanne's hefty pressure.  It can be worse.  Believe me, I know.  I also worked for Roseanne. <BR>

<DD>Joss - What else can I say?  You've listened to the wrong people.  But I know you have an empire to run and have no intention of ever talking to me about this, so how else can I get a message to you?  Just call?  I did.  You are done with me and angry that I said something in  public that you didn't want to hear.  Or be heard.  <BR>
<BR>
I've worked seven days a week on this show.  Many days for free.  You must remember that.  And I've worked hard to make sure that you got what you wanted.  Very hard.  And I often had to push to make it happen.  Some people tend to act differently about you when you are not around - in case you wondered.  I always defended you and what you wanted.  Always.<BR>
<BR>
I knew also that you'd go beserk and could never admit that maybe a mistake had been made.  So I didn't expect anything.  Just wanted you to get some idea of how I felt the only way I knew how.  Sorry if that's corny to you guys.   <BR>
<BR>
I don't want anything.  I just wanted my friends to know the truth and how I felt so that I wouldn't have to go on explaining over and over why I'm not around.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry to incur your wrath so, O King.  Wish we could talk in person for a bit.  Just to put my mind at ease.  But you are not one to talk things out.  Not with the lowly likes of me anyway.  Maybe only Generals (and actors who smell really nice)<BR>
<BR>
People who want to use you are a dime a dozen.  Loyal people are not.  One day you may know what I mean.  Right now you can't see it.  <BR>
<BR>
Didn't mean to embarrass you.  I did the best I could for you and you know that.  But things have gone on that you have no idea about.  Games that I've seen played out before are happening around you and there is nothing I can do.  And since you won't speak to me, I can never tell you.<BR>
<BR>
I hope one day you'll understand.<BR>

Miremba, (finally he replies) we try hard not to connect the shows unless we're doing a deliberate crossover.  When we find they are too similar we'll move an ep, or sometimes just point out that fact.  Hence the Willow-on-phone cameo.  We realized we had encrypted discs in both shows, and thought it would be amusing to point it out rather than change it.  As for themes -- well, I'm me, and David G. and Marti are them, so we have certain themes that naturally show up in both shows.

<BR>
I read the Parable of the Knight.  Felt I aught to comment on the situation.  Yes, Jeff is leaving.  It's sad.  Jeff was a huge asset to Buffy -- he took it to a new level of action and grace with Sophia, and his style will always be a part of the show.  But this isn't a fairy tale.  Or a thinly veiled 'parable'.  It's a hard, gruelingly hard job, ten months a year, thirteen hours a day, with fifty or more people straining, working, getting in each other's face, stepping on each other's toes, driving each other crazy.  It happens.  And the only thing that keeps it together is the effort people make to work together.  Doesn't always happen.  There are conflicts, raging egos -- and even occasional backstabbing, I'm sorry to say.  There are very few 'plots', and as far as I can tell, no jousting of any kind.  People just wear on each other and eventually sometimes you have to make a change.  No one's to blame -- or everyone is.  But either people get into a groove of working as part of the whole or they don't.  And seeing yourself as a noble knight being plotted against by evil courtiers really doesn't help.  Remember that.

When BUFFY first aired I remember people making a joke of the early fights in the first season and laughing at it.  Rated at 101 out of 106 shows, it was nearly canceled.  Now it's huge and rated 23rd in the nation.  That's pretty cool and I'm glad I was there to see it happen and play a part in the action side of things.  So it's not like I'm not satisfied.  It's just too bad that I can't make the full 100.  But that's life in ugly big H.<BR>
<BR>
Lots o' jealousy and false whisperings to undermine going around.  Too bad I have little idea of it.  I don't get to talk to the people in charge much anymore.  All I know is what has been brought to my attention by very frightened folk who remain in hiding.  <BR>
<BR>
I do enjoy alking to the folks here and I appreciate the kind words that Sophia and I have gotten over the years.  It's kept us going in some really negative circumstances that are out of our control.  <BR>

Dark Lady - No.  I won't be returning next season.  That's what I've been told.  So I wrote a little parable about the sitch for any and all (especially Joss) who should care to read it.  <BR>
Just a little story that may be corny, but at least it doesn't mention names.  Trying my best to be nice as I can be.  Or as Sam Jackson said in PULP FICTION.  "Trying real hard to be the sheperd."  I don't want to be the bad man.<BR>

<DD>Frodo - When she hit the concrete while being jerked off the table by Forest was when she was hurt the worst.  Had to stay down for a while afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
She also got hurt when she whacked her head on the floor of the big battle scene too.  Not to mention the usual punches to the head and stuff.  That goes without saying.  <BR>
<BR>
And Adam's arms were not exactly easy on her little arms.  She had a flimsy top and he had pointy armor shell.  The usual black & blue body.  Only now is she starting to look her normal color.  And I'm starting to feel human again too after living through the hellish 4th season.

<DD>Thanks Zeus - That was me and my old Asian stunt team.  I repeated a wire gag that we did on that show.  (Yes.  This was many, many years before there was even a Matrix script)<BR>
<BR>
That brings me to the question that got me on here:<BR>
<BR>
In the script (and trhough every re-write) Buffy did the whole "I wave my hand and stop your bullets thing."  That's true.  Someting yo see in lots of Japanese animation heroics.  Which I suppose Joss must enjoy too.  Everyone kept saying "Oh that's from Matrix."  But really the Wachowski Bros. wanted to do a GHOST IN THE SHELL in live action mixed in with the EXACT copy of the fights from FIST OF LEGEND.  So that's where The Matrix came from.<BR>
<BR>
I did choreograph the fight and I added the wire kick.  I did one in the big battle (when Buffy kicks the two demons with a jump kick).  The original idea I had there was that we could pan off Buffy in mid-air over to Riley fighting.  That's what we shot.  It was used in a montage of overlapping shots at the end.  So it worked pretty well.<BR>
<BR>
The director liked it so much that he said we should do one at the end of the Adam fight.  I told him that I was worried that Joss might think it too much and so I asked him if I could have him shoot a tight shot of the chest of Adam being hit and a wider shot at the same time.  That way it could easily be edited into a simple single Front Kick if Joss didn't approve.  And that's what we did. <BR>
<BR>
Then in editing (much to my surprise) they chose to turn the Triple kick that I had Sophia do into Six Mid-Air Kicks.  I was shocked.  But I thought, "Okay then.  It's the magic thing they want to get across."  So that's why it even went beyond Matrix with the number of kicks.<BR>
<BR>
It is, however, the same thing we did on GUYVER 2 all those years ago.

Not in the interest of quotas, just 'casue he's cool and we DO need a little diversity on the show (I'm talking character, not culture, but the two are inevitably -- and fortuitously -- linked) is a good thing.

<DD>Amish Boy: Hell no.  I not only love the title of the show, I need it.  Keeps it real.  The network tried to change it (our only big dispute in four years), first to SLAYER and then to BUFFY.  But the title is nessa becasue a)it says it all, action horror comedy and a 'the', and b)it keeps us from getting TOO ponderous.  Gotta keep the whimsy, especially in a show that gets so heavy.  The WB said there was an audience we'd never reach with that title, and they may have been right, but as for that audience, say it with me now, THOSE GUYS ARE LAME!  Yup.

<DD>I don't know much about precursers to the Matrix.  But like the Terminator, it took a story that had existed in part in previous incarnations and perfected, created the Lasting Work.  There were, after all, a couple of revenge plays about a cranky Dane before there was Hamlet.<BR>
<BR>
Nowto paraphrase last night's post that got et, I wanted to comment on our rather obvious homage of last night to same film.  We broke the story, magic-girl bests machine-man, and in pre-production realized the structural similaities to the Matrix.  I became sheepish and insisted we make sure the action looked NOTHING LIKE the film, 'cause I'm not interested in being too derivative.  I was VERY SPECIFIC on the subject.  Of course, I wasn't around when they were filming it, I was preeping my show and having my organs removed.  So IMAGINE THE LAUGHTER when I saw dailies.  The incredilbe lack of laughter.  But it was too late to reshoot, and it did look cool, so I lived with it.  Still, proof posative (as if I needed more) that I can't run two shows AND maintain basic personal hygiene.  Guess which one's gonna go? (Sorry, Kai...)</SMALL>

miremba: yeah, violin for several years alongside pano. Its a wonderful instrument, and everyone said I was good at it, but I grew to hate playing it : it's REALLY difficult!!! Ithought the flute would be cool: its a great sound.<BR>
<BR>
dru: hows Luna Park? I hear its being refurbished. Didya know the Scenic Railway is the oldest operating Rollercoaster in the world? (for the moment). NO Angel sopundtrack yet. MP3s maybe soon, now that I have the time.<BR>
<BR>
Amelia: lots of hard work. Coming to America really helped!!<BR>
<BR>
Little Wiggins: no Aussie TV scores for me (yet). I did score an Australian movie "Maslin's Beach" which screened on TV (much to my surprise as it's a comedy set on a nude beach) but that's Aussie TV for ya!<BR>
<BR>
Dragonlady: thanks!

<DD>miremba: I went to Woodville High (SA) and Adelaide Uni. primary instrument is piano. Funny about your flute: at primary school they started a music program and they asked me whcih instrument I wanted to learn (already doing piano). I said "flute" and they said "Um, we're out of flutes, how about violin?"<BR>
<BR>
dru: WOW! BIG HUGE THANKYOU that is QUITE a compliment indeed!!!! What Aussie state are you from??<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane: Yes, still shared credit. It is easier, WAY easier for me to just keep the shared credit for this season.<BR>
<BR>
Melody: I aslo scored the music for 41 epsiodes of Sliders, which was TONS of fun. Yeah: mostly minor keys on TV, though I snuck in a major chord on tonight's eppy when we first see the scroll in the Wolfram and Hart vault, and I got away with it!!<BR>
<BR>
white wings: who said the layers had to stop at three? I reckon you should keep the layers of caramel and chocolate coming until you can't stand it any longer<BR>
<BR>
BeMu: you'll notice I placed the layer of caramel inside the chocolate for that very reason.
