<DD>Well, it's been lovely, as always, but I must be going.<BR>
<BR>
<b>KAM:</b>  LOL...that's not really it.  He just doesn't think to tell me anything.  He's the antithesis of a "chatty" person. Ask him how his day was?  you'll hear:  "OK.  Not too bad."  Ask if anything cool is going on with the band, and you'll get, "Not really."  THEN, you'll find out some big producer requested a copy of the Cd or whatever.  He's just incredibly underwhelmed by things.  He's a real character.<BR>
<b>nyte-eyes:</b>  Well, hello, goodbye, and goodnight!  =)<BR>
<b>slay_me:</b>  <BR>
Please tell <b>Slayed Soul</b> I said hello right back!<BR>
<BR>
Well, goodnight, everyone!<BR>

<DD><b>SLaYeR:</b>  Thanks!  I'm well.  =)<BR>
<b>Buffy Sheridan:</b>  Do you mean my favorite characters?  Well, I'd have to go with Spike, Giles, Willow, and Angel.  As characters.  But Nick and Seth are way up there as actors...and of course, Sarah and Charisma rock too!  =)<BR>
<b>Ali/Briolette:</b>  ah...but I've already had that pleasure.  (the fish thing.)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  In a bad mood?  Hope not.  Well, hello and have a nice evening!<BR>
<b>GAPeach:</b>  Kinda new, huh?  Well, cool!  I'm not actually all that important...I'm the lead singer of a popular "Buffy band."  We were on the ep, NKABOTFD, and we're pretty well liked by the cast and crew.  We even played the cast/crew wrap party for the end of season 2.  (With Four Star Mary.)  It was great fun.

<DD><b>GirlFriday:</b>  Well, it's very nice to meet you! =)<BR>
<b>Godeater:</n>  Um...well...?  See, I'm not very revolutionary here on the board...more of a diplomatic type, actually.  Perhaps even a goodwill ambassador of sorts.  So, I don't think I have the right personality makeup for your club.  But thanks for the invitation!<BR>

<DD>GAPeach:</b>  Hello!  Nice to meet you...one of my best friends is from Georgia.  Roswell, to be exact.<BR>
<b>Ali/Briolette:</b>  Hi!  Yep, I've been watching.  And I saw Revelations, and loved it...although I am just WAITING for Spike to come back tomorrow!<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  Bon soir.  Ça va bien, merci. Mais je suis tellement fatiguée...comme toujours, n'est-ce pas?<BR>
<b>KAM:</b>  Hi, there!  Yes, I know...I was so in the dark about the PBP that I was talking to Jeff and said, "So?  I wonder when they're going to pick a location?"  And he's all, "Oh...did I forget to mention?  It's at ________."  He never tells me anything.  *sigh*

<DD><b>slay_me:</b>  I'm fine, but feeling terribly overworked!!  Taking a little break here in the Bronze should do the trick, though.  =)<BR>
<b>Buffy Sheridan:</b>  Hiya!  Well, I'll be going over to my Aunt and Uncle's house in Chatsworth, CA for Thanksgiving, as I am 3,000 miles away from my parents, grandma, etc.  I'm looking forward to it, though...especially since I don't get a chance to visit with them very often.  And the group's doing great!  As a matter of fact, our new keyboard player is here right now, working on new material with us.<BR>
<b>Blackheart:</b> *blush*  I'm fine, thank you.  And you?
