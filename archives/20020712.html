<dd>Major Wiggins:  Ep. 1.  Scary Angel.  Promise.<br><br>Justice:  You always remember your first.  Unless you were really drunk and hey how did I end up wearing a dress?  But I digress.   Work is great.  I hear there’s more waiting for me when I’m done here.<br><br>Tamz:  I’m a Milky Way man myself.  Ten seconds in the microwave, then melty gooey goodness.<br><br>DeMoriel:  Mmm… Xbox.<br><br>Genevieve’s Lucie:  Interesting things coming up for Cordy.  That’s all I’m saying!<br><br>Abt:  I’ll probably be doing the standard issue three eps of Angel.   Since I’m also supposed to be writing a Buffy and a Firefly, three A’s are all I can handle.  As for Seeing Red, I couldn’t find what the disagreement was about, but I’m sure one of you is probably right.<br><br>Okay, gotta fly and be free.  I’ll try to stop back in soon.<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>PWAC:  That would explain why I’m nekkid.<br><br>Allyson:  Heaven forefend! If women play by those rules, they’re going to get the husband they deserve.  My much better half is a funny, talented, kickboxing mamma yama that doesn’t hesitate to tell me when I’m being an idiot.  To be truly happy you need someone that challenges you – not put you to sleep.  I personally LOVE strong women (especially when they love me back).<br><br>Denise:  Three’s company.  Is he cute?<br><br>Nikka:  No need to answer that one.  Mmm… Columbian.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  Mmm… leather Fred.<br><br>Stellasurya:  Dark and multilayered coming right up.  And yes, there will be a crossover this season:  Me.  I’m supposed go back and write one Buffy.  I’m angling for a nekkid Spike ep.<br><br>Zeus:  Dancing shrimp in cages.  It’s all the rage.<br><br><br><br>Okay kids!  Daddy gotta work.  One more round then it’s back to the coal mine.<br><br>

<dd>Paks:  Pass along my congrats to newt.  And hey, Steve’s a great name for a girl.  (I’m a little girly, don’t you know?)<br><br>Tamz:  Many things new.  A couple old.  And something blue, but I ain’t telling you what, ‘cause hey – family board.<br><br>Aramina:  Guitar player.  A good one, as opposed to the sucky McSuck that I am now.<br><br>Neonate:  Angel is in the same building as Buffy and Firefly, just downstairs.  Joss made me an offer that I couldn’t refuse, so there I am.  The biggest difference is Angel is much more hands on for the writers.  We’re involved in pretty much everything.  So if my ep. 1 sucks, it was all my fault.<br><br>Cashmere:  Well, here’s the scoop.  Angel and Buffy – hey, wait a minute!  Abt warned me about you!  Bad spoiler, bad!<br><br>Dudley etc etc:  You know a buddy of mine emailed me this the other day.  Could Buffy get any cooler?  (Without me around, probably.)<br><br>

<dd>Major Wiggins:  Don’t make me come over there.<br><br>Tiggy: I’d never desert you fine folk!  Just been extra busy running around like a nut.  The actors aren’t back on Angel yet – I think it’ll be about a week more.  Lucky actors.<br><br>Scourage.  Dragons.  Wee little bitter dragons.  I’m just sayin’.<br><br>NuPhalanx:  When are you going to see the all-nekkid Cordy, Faith, Fred eppy?  Heck, I’m watching it in my head right now.  No wait!  That’s ME nekkid!  Look away!  Look away!<br><br>Denise:  Work on Angel’s great.  There’s quite a bit of it.  Which I’m currently avoiding so I can talk with you.  If I get fired, I’m coming to live with you, so tiddy up!<br><br>Nikka:  Mmm… Columbian.  Wait a sec!  Columbian coffee?<br><br>

<dd>Neonate:  Greetings right back at you.<br><br>Aramina:  Q:  You have been forced by some evil machine gun wielding baboon to dramatically change your existing career. What do you chose?  A:  Angel.<br><br>Genevieve’s Lucie:  Interesting Angel tidbits?  Episode 1 is done and starts filming in two weeks.  Ep. 2, written by Mere Smith, is electrifying.  A real knockout – don’t miss it.  Ep. 3 is currently being penned by David Fury and ep.4 is being outlined by masterful Jeff Bell.  Shaping up to be a great season.  As is Buffy and Firefly.  You will watch all shows!  So commands the power that is me!<br><br>Zues:  No pants.  And yes, angel is dead.  Has been for years.<br><br>
