miremba - don't forget the weekly main title credit.<BR>
<BR>
Poet - Four Star Hottie is a great band, I agree<BR>

Hey Rob, uhhh, nice score (wow this must be how all you Bronzers feel talking to a composer... not much else to say is there...), no really, nice score.<BR>

As opposed to the sometimes-jaded LA crowd, if you know what I mean.  Well, keep me posted.  I've been trying to get off my lazy butt and get out to see more shows, you know?  Add my e-mail to your mailing list or something, will ya?<BR>
<b>M Marchand:</b>  Hello!  Well, I was only the show once, so bow down to <b>Chris</b>, as he is the MAN.<BR>

Sabrina - Man, if I had a nickel for every time somebody compared me to Mozart...<BR>
<BR>
{dru} - yes you can expect more of me & Giles - and I *am* talking fanfic<BR>
<BR>
TAD - my close-up aside (hehe) didja see who got all the screen time?  Guess he picked the right side of the stage.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Uncle Godeater, Joxy<BR>
<BR>
Malista - I tortured Joss by playing Philip Glass records until he agreed to put me in the show - the CBCC had nothing to do with it<BR>
<BR>
<small>(Sorry to any Phil Glass fans out there)</small><BR>
<BR>
Nikki Noo - Do you have the soundtrack that came out six months ago?  There's one score piece on that, from Season 2.<BR>

SoCalers - hey!  ummm what's DTS?  Are you guys in six-channel digital surround?<BR>
<BR>
Hi Kiera, thanks<BR>
<BR>
Little Alex - oops, that wasn't me singing (see below) - also slay_me and glitter - look down<BR>
<BR>
TAD as in 4SM TAD?  My trip will start in two weeks.  Got all my shots so I won't get Yellow Fever.  Aren't you guys supposed to be far away soon too?<BR>
<BR>
miremba - well, I could have had more screen time.  Let's work that angle.  A supporting role would be nice too.<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - influences - my brother (the trippy backwards sounds), Dead Can Dance (the pseudo-Mid-Eastern vocal), Jim Morrison (the Vietnam bit), and the combined powers of Joss Whedon and Regis Kimble (the editor), who put together an inspiring and challenging temp score.  Also Steve Forman who slammed the sh*t out of some rather large drums.<BR>
<BR>
Working with Mamak was interesting - I had all these melodies worked out and wrote them out for her, but she just sort of shrugged and said "show me the picture".  So I did, and I gave her a cue each time I wanted her to sing something, and it was really really really cool.<BR>
<BR>
Ahh Melody - much as I love to bang hard on stuff the piano is my preferred tool.  Can't play - ahem - Melody on drums now can you?<BR>
<BR>

Nikki Noo - that is the question of the year, and the source of some frustration for me.  Fox has been in negotiations with several record companies for a while now for a score CD.  I know it will happen, but I'm not going to speculate when anymore.  I'm just always wrong.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.<BR>
<BR>
LisaH - Thanks.  Yes there are plans to do an Angel soundtrack, but it will probably be mostly songs (like Buffy) and maybe one score piece.  It's in the eary planning stages.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Kristen.  I know of affluters - I watched Angel too.  Darla looks great even all recently-raised.<BR>
<BR>
Inscrutable - my dog is my inspiration.  You can have him over my dead body.<BR>
<BR>
Crrep Crawley - I wanna wanna wanna so very much wanna do a musical episode.  It would be the challenge of my career to be sure, and I wouldn't want to try it with anyone but Joss, but I know it would be totally great.  I mentioned the idea to him a month ago and he just smiled that evil smile of his.<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane - that was Mamak <small>ummm forgot her last name - Azam?</small> from Iran doing the vocals.  She also sang on The Peacemaker.  And thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Erika - Hey, thanks.  I remember as if it were yesterday... seeing NKABOTFD and thinking "that could be *me* in a second-and-a-half piano cameo one day in a bout three years"...  :)

For the curious, Joss wrote the music and lyrics to Giles' song.  That is actually me and Four Star Mary playing; we went into the studio about a month ago to record it with Tony (Head).

The ice cream truck scene:  FOR THE RECORD, i had envisioned the scene very differently, the girls all matter-of-fact and parka'd up (honestly.)  But I mentioned the dream ep to Amber and her first comment was: "will Aly   and I act all slutty in Xander's dream?" and then I spoke to Aly   and her first comment was "can Amber and I dress all trampy?" and well, they both seemed so excited... so if it seems like a bit much, just understand I was led from the path of righteousness by my two hottie friends and it's only partially (okay, largely) my fault.<BR>
