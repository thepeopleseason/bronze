<dd>You know, I actually feel bad dangling that Buffy talk in front of you when I know full well I have to go back to work.  I apologize.  That was totally dick of me.  I’ll make it up to you – I’ll try and stop in sometime this week and we’ll have a full-on Q & A session.<br><br>Holy crap, that’ll be awesome for you guys.<br><br>In the meantime, keep it real.  You guys rule.  Thanks for helping me goof-off.<br><br>Goddard out.<br><br><br>Oh -- and could somebody please tell my Minions that I love them?  Thanks.<br><br>

<dd>Christ – doesn’t anyone want to talk about Buffy?  Here I am, all ready to spoil the entire season, and nobody asks me anything.  How often are you gonna have a VIP here on a Sunday night all drunk and vulnerable and ready to spill his guts on everything?  <br><br>Okay, maybe I’m not vulnerable.  But boy, am I ever drunk.<br><br>

<dd>BlackMagicBitsy:   Am I really a star in a fanfic entry?  Which one?  Is it dirty?  I don’t think I’m supposed to read fanfic.  Unless it stars me.  And is dirty.  Really, really dirty.<br><br>Spikmeister – how are you?  What time is it there in England? <br><br>Zeus:  I’d go with Apocalypse and Mr. Sinister.  Sinister isn’t that great of a character, actually, but I think he looks cool.<br><br>Slayerdaddy – good to see you, as always.<br><br>

<dd>Zeus – I think I gotta go with the brown and gold.  You?<br><br>Garnet – can’t say I recommend the movie, though Joss did write the line “You’re a dick.”  That part’s pretty cool.  But otherwise, if you’re at all interested in X-Men, stick with the comics.  If you’re not interested, perhaps you could spend your free time ladling soup to somebody less fortunate than you.<br><br>BlackMagicBitsy:  Hey!  How are you?  What’s going on?  What the Hell are you doing up so late?<br><br>

<dd>Zeus – believe it or not, I’m actually here at the office working on an episode as we speak.  I thought I’d take a little break.  What should we talk about?<br><br>

<dd>Let's talk about X-Men some more.  Am I the only one who thinks Havoc's old black and white costume with the weird headpiece was awesome?<br><br>
