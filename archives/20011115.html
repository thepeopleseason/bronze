<dd>My Goodness but this has been a lovely time.  But the cocktail hour grows near.  <br><br>RE: Heavenly dimensions.  I imagine heaven is sort of like hell, except the opposite.  Not the opposite like it's really cold instead of really hot, but you know, nice instead of not nice.  And if there are lots of levels of hell or layers then there should a lot of heaven layers.  But then again, I AM ALIVE.  So what do I know?<br><br>TO MALLY B.  You are nice.  Thanks for saying you like my writing.<br><br>DEAR KOSHER WEENIE:  I am sorry.  Please go to shul and do some prayin'.<br><br>TO THOSE INTERESTED IN A MUTANT ENEMY BOARD]]]<br>I just did what you asked and told Joss as he passed by my office that you guys really really don't want a mutant enemy message board.  I did good, right?  You like me like you like Steven, right?  <br><br>TO THOSE SAME PEOPLE:<br>Ha ha.<br><br>TO ALL OF EVERYBODY.<br>People are working here.  Hmmm.  Time for me to have Steve mix me a Gibson and bring me my slippers in his teeth.<br><br><br>Soon we will all meet at the Beverly Wilshire and drink champagne and blood and whatever else we enjoy.<br><br>Until then....<br><br>Au Revoir mes amis...<br><br><br>xxx Rebecca<br><br>

<dd>Frodo ... your wish is my command.  Or your command is my wish.  Your request is my desire.  Crap, this is sounding like Duran Duran lyrics now.<br>Anyway, more dancing?  I'm on it.<br><br>Oh, and Allyson?  Your Fury is too busy to play today - unlike us, he's actually working for a living - down on the set directing (yes, directing) episode 11.<br><br>Very exciting ...<br><br>

<dd>...yeah, with bacon. No, just ONE cheeseburger with bacon, TWO
shrimp cocktails. Yeah... oh, hello, Rebecca. No, no, I'm handling the
news just fine. Hnag on -- Hey! I need Bac-os on that salad! Okay,
great.

<dd>Hmm... dates for upcoming episodes... not really sure. I'm writing
ep 12 now, which I believe will air in late January. DeKnight will write
13 and Petrie, 14. Beyond that it grows misty...  misty...

<dd>Dear Master Jane, <br><br> Are we truly alone? I feel that those
other people can hear us. But you are correct--I am but a protege and I
know nothing of these magical interweb workings. If you say we are
alone, then truly I believe you. I will unload my burdened heart at your
feet in due time. <br><br> ALSO: to the cocktail weenie. Poor you. You
are under some severe misapprehensions my young koshered friend. Drew Z.
is not a hep-cat. He is more of an equilateral rectangle
porpoise. Please do not go trafe when you hear this bad news. <br><br>
ALSO: Thank you sincerely all who praise. I liked TAbula RAsa too. It's
my favorite that I've written. <br><br> ALSO: What is the dresscode for
this BIg Boy's event? And should I bring a small gift... <br><br> XXX

image! Isn't she swell?

<dd>Hi Jane, Are we alone here?<br><br><br>ALSO:I hope you guys aren't insulted by how rude I am.  I am a snobby jerk--that's my persona.  My lord, is it hysterical.<br><br>ALSO: Have you all SEEN Steve DeKnight's Henna tattoos?!  My word.  One day, Steve and Drew were having a quote unquote muscle man contest and when we saw all the Henna.  Let's just say the flipped wigs hit the **** fan.  Can you swear on this?<br><br>XXX REbecca<br><br>

<dd>Yipes. This is terrifying. I am much more the pen and paper, neigh,
rock and cave-wall sort of writer. This cyper-space in which you dwell
gives me the heebi-jeebies.  Nevertheless, hello. Hello. Are you all
weird blood-drinking nerd freaks or what? I would like to invite you all
for a glass of champagne at the Beverly Wilshire bar, but I'm afraid you
will try to drink my blood and teach me about Star Trek and paint Henna
tattoos on me. Is this true? XXX REBECCA

<dd>Hey de ho ho ho.  Just a quick drive-by to let you guys know I'll be bringing Rebecca Rand Kirshner by tomorrow for her first posting session.  Not sure when it'll be, since I need her brain to help me break my episode by Monday.  But put the word out -- she's a fabulous writer and an even better person.<br><br>That's it that's all.  Gotta go smack that crazy cartoon into shape.<br><br>
