<DD>carl - If you recall some time ago PEOPLE magazine pulled a similar trick.  They told Sophia they were doing a story on stunts and talked to her for an hour about her Hong Kong work and Buffy.  Only at the end did they mention Sarah and asked Sophia how she could double someone so thin.  Sophia just told them that Sarah liked to be reall really thin and that she just had to watch out not to do too much weight training.  When the article came out it wasn't about stunts at all.  They had that quote from Sophia next to big letters that said ANOREXIC HOLLYWOOD or something like that.  It was all about how actresses are too thin.  They just used Sophia's name even though she told them that she would not answer questions about Sarah.<BR>
<BR>
I can't trust those people at all.  They are scummy.

<DD>MizA - I love POLICE STORY.  That was the one that Brandon Lee copied the most for RAPID FIRE.  So check it out.<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie - For the opening fight of BEER BAD I got to have Sophia do a fight in which Buffy DIDN'T get her butt kicked.  I used the mini-tramp and had her wipe out the vamps.  It was fun.<BR>
<BR>
Later I rigged a wire stunt to allow Sophia to swing up to the window.  It was a rig that I came up with that had the cable run between her legs over to her back.  The fx guys had never seen it done before.  They had told me that it was impossible to rig on that set.<BR>
<BR>
I also did a car it on cuts.  My idea was to edit shots that made it appear as if the stuntman was hurled backward from the impact of the car.  By doing one shot at a time I was able to save the stuntman some serious pain and still make it effective.  I did that because of the lack of pads he had.<BR>
<BR>
Haven - I sometimes ask for special props and sets and sometimes I make my own.  For example:  The spinning pole, the pole vault hinge, and the stage itself in ANNE I had made from drawings that I did.<BR>
<BR>
I set up the different levels in HUSH and rigged the rope and wire gag.  I used bungee cord I brought to make softer landings for my stunt guys when hitting the solid wood and steel.<BR>
<BR>
When Faith was introduced I rigged pipes at head height and had a car brought in to fight on in another episode.  Even the spinning stake that you see in the openning credits was something I designed especially for that fight.  Joss asked me if there was any way to teach Sarah herself to do something fancy with the stake, like tossing and catching it or twirling it between her fingers somehow.  So I drew a pic of a spinning ring similar to the one used by Sam Rami for the EVIL DEAD.<BR>
<BR>
Check out Jackie Chan's MY STUNTS DVD and he talks about using obects in fights.  A very good lesson it is to watch him at work.

<DD>Karen - Some guys from CBS had talked to me and Stanley Tong (Martial Law producer) about doing a special on how we do our fights.  Some of the producers involved kept wanting to make it into yet another daredevil show and so it was sidetracked.  I think that one day I'll do something like that.  I have written articles on stuntwork for various magazines before.  Maybe I'll try that sometime.  I'm thinking about an indepth book one day that will include alot of the stunt cordinators I admire explaining how we do what we do.  <BR>
Any of that would help kids.  That's one reason Jackie shows some clips of guys getting hurt.  They realize it's an athletic performance and not a real fight when they see this.  Plus the fact that you WILL get hurt.  That I can promise.

<DD>Hope I didn't sound too harsh in trying to explain to Fury what it is that I do on the show.  Believe me, none of the fights you see on BUFFY are written out the way you see them.  Even if the writer had that kind of foresight and knowledge, it would take pages as long as the script itself to describe accurately.  Trust me.<BR>
<BR>
I guess I'm just upset over what happened today at the magazine stand.  I know Sophia will be too.  It just goes to show you what we go through all the time in this business.<BR>
<BR>
What happened was this:<BR>
Sophia was called by the WB publicity people.  A magazine called "Fitness" wanted to do an article on her training and diet.  Since it came through the WB she said yes.  She made it very clear to the interviewer that she does all of the Buffy fighting and that she is not Sarah's trainer.  (They had tried to get her to say this and she refused) She gave them a routine that she does.   They then told her that they'd do a seperate article on Sarah and then one on Sophia.  <BR>
<BR>
The magazine came out today and guess what?  The article is about how Sophia trains Sarah and has quotes from Sophia.  She was talking about herself and her own training.  They made it appear as if she was talking about Sarah.  They even used her workout and pretened that it was Sarah's. And no pic of Sophia anywhere either.<BR>
<BR>
So that got to me.  Stunts is the only part of show business where someone else is given credit for your creativity and hard work on a regular basis.  Somehow this has to change or things will never improve for stunt people.

<SMALL>(Tue Feb  8 22:56:37 2000 169.132.153.29)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Fury - I did read it.  And I discussed it with the director before choreographing and shooting.  I've learned that aside from the script, the other important things involved include:  <BR>
Which direction the actors will enter and exit from.  What angles can be shot successfully without showing the wrong background.  And not to mention what kind of time constraints I may be under at the time.  It also matters what people are involved stuntwise as to how good we can make it.  Not to mention the moods that various people in front and behind the camera might be in at any time.  All these come into play when choreographing a good fight on BUFFY.<BR>
<BR>
The story points included were:  Riley taking aim and yelling at Buffy as she gets out of the way.<BR>
<BR>
The dangling feet that you wanted to use to cut away from to go to the feet of Riley and Buffy in bed.  (which we shot, but wasn't used in the final edit)<BR>
<BR>
The fact that Riley is supposed to pull out his baton and use it.<BR>
<BR>
And the fact that two of the Commandos have a net.  Those were the things from the script that related to the fight.<BR>
<BR>
What I did was this:<BR>
I choreographed some fight action between the Demon and the net guys that would make it impossible for the "Mason" character to shoot the demon without risking hitting the guys.<BR>
This included swiping hand combos that struck both guys and Buffy during the same movements.  The net guys performed back-dive and HK spin stunts and I had them use the net in a way that would allow Chris Palermo (my Demon stuntman) to wrap them in it and spin them.  They weere either on the ground or being hit.  They never stood there and watched.  <BR>
<BR>
I kept Buffy involved at all times using switch footwork and trapping hands.  This kept her too close to the monster for Riley or Mason to shoot.<BR>
<BR>
The only difficlut thing was when I wanted Sophia to pull off a round kick/spin wheel kick combo while stepping over Riley.  This was difficult but she pulled it off every time.<BR>
<BR>
The techniques I used for Riley's baton come from Escrima.  I used Wing Chun technique to trap the Demon's arm while executing the baton combo.<BR>
<BR>
These a some of the things I put into the fight.  None of which are on paper because it would never occur to someone sitting in front of a computer that any of this detail would be needed to be thought of.  It's a different world.  <BR>
<BR>
Writing is one thing.  Actually performing is altogether different.  That's why they have pros who choreograph these things.  Most of what I read in scripts not only doesn't work well, but would just look lame if we tried to do it.  Often the techniques described don't even exist.  I agree with Joss.  Just write "fighty mcfight" and leave it up to me.  Those are the best fights on BUFFY.  Too much detail doesn't really help us to get the job done and be creative.  Which is what I was hired to do.

On ANGEL Wesley is doubled by Dane Falwell.  The guy I used to use for him now doubles Marc.  His name is Brain Macleit.<BR>
<BR>
I forget Bai Ling's double at the moment.  I think it's Mei.  She's  the Wu Shu instructor to a few of my stunt guys and has just started doing stunts.  She's only the third Asian girl to go into stunt work in Hollywood.

<DD>chi - Well using furniture and props is a fave thing of Jackies and I like it too.  It all depends on the story and whether it fits.  Not to mention the fact that often times I can't touch anything in the room.  On most shows I just use whatever I want.  On this one I often have to go to great lengths to try and NOT break or bend anything.  Not always easy.  <BR>
<BR>
Jeff Imada doesn't choreograph his own fights, however.  If you are talking about RAPID FIRE, Brandon came over to my place and watched tons of HK movies and then made copies to show the director.  He imitated those.  On Imadas other films a guy named Al Leong does the choreography.  Jeff mainly handles the hiring.  Similar to the way Spiro coordinates ANGEL, but has the other guys do the actual fight choreography. <BR>
<BR>
WebmMK - That scene was done in record time.  They'd spent all day shooting other stuff and by the time they got to us they were many hours behind.  So we did a quicky in two takes.<BR>
<BR>
LJC - Bai Ling's stunt double is currently shooting CHARLIE'S ANGELS doing the action for Lucy Lui.  She'll get to really show off her Wu Shu skills on it.

<DD>Sorry Mr. Fury.  But you won't find any of those fight moves in your script.  I choreographed those myself.  The part of the script that I kept was the information about Riley and the guns.  That was story-related.  The actual moves I had to choreograph so that it would make sense.  And look cool.  The fight we actually shot was much bigger than what you see in the final edit.  I knew it had to be intercut with the bedroom scene, but I also knew that I couldn't just have all the commandos standing around and doing nothing.  That's why in the wide shots you see them getting involved in the fight more.  In the complete version you would see EVERYONE in motion at all times trying to battle the Demon.  <BR>
<BR>
Even though I figured it would be cut way down and rely more on slow-mo close-ups, I still made a complete fight with a beginning/middle/ and end - just in case the footage was needed.  Otherwise we'd have what we call in the fight game "major egg."  That means guys standing still and waiting while the fighter works over someone else.   And that's the one thing Joss hates the most in any fight.  And that's why I never go by any choreography that's written in any script unless it has to do with a story point.  <BR>
<BR>
But on a more important note:  I'm very upset at this whole thing of Marc sleeping with that girl.  She's way too worldly for him.  He's a nice boy from Iowa.  He doesn't know anything about the sexual games that those high falutin' college gals play.

Bye for now.

<DD>Trying to find a way to make the PBP.  But thanks, Cosmic Bob, for the option.<BR>
<BR>
Autumn - Actually, I don't find any of the characters hard to write for.  They've been so clearly realized by Joss.<BR>
<BR>
Neil - I'll tell you this... Oz will return.  With an interesting announcement.<BR>
<BR>
And Mr. Pointy will not appear in ep. 17.  Sorry, Mr. P fans.

<DD>A blanket post to all those who have a B/R problem...<BR>
<BR>
Yes, we all know Angel is Buffy's great love, her first love... But sometimes you don't end up with your great love, or at the very least, you're separated by circumstances, like one going off to war.<BR>
<BR>
Buffy is a healthy, young woman (with a short life-expectancy).  And Riley is a nice, handsome guy... <BR>
<BR>
There's an ancient Babylonian saying: "If you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with."  <BR>
<BR>
There's no reason you can't root for a little happiness in our slayer's life.<BR>
<BR>
There's no reason not to think Buffy and Angel will come back together, even if it happens off-camera after both shows are no longer on the air.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, relax... And let Riley and Buffy have their time.<BR>
<BR>
That is all.

<DD>As to why I have time on my hands to be posting right now... we succeeded in breaking BUFFY 19 and ANGEL 19 yesterday, so we're on kind of a breather for the rest of the week.  Hanging out, if you will, until we start on BUFFY 20 and 21 next week.

<DD>Horizon - The current ep we're filming is ep. 17, which features a surprising return of a beloved (well, by us, anyway)character from Buffy's past.
