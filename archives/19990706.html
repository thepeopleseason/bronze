<DD>Last post...<BR>

<b>Buffy Wannabe:</b>  They're planning on using "Strong," although there has been some interest in our "Buffy" song, as well.  =)  Thanks for the support!<BR>
<b>oZmAn:</b>  Hehehe...it's OK.  I didn't even realize they'd been on the show!  Shows you what I know!  lol  Maybe they were just in a bad mood...but they starting loading all their gear up in front of the stage <i>while</i> we were still performing, and they interrupted me in the middle of a song (during an instrumental part) asking when the "bleep" we'd be getting off the stage, etc.  Not very nice.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you to EVERYONE who voted, and keep getting people to do so, OK?  I'll see you guys when I get back!  Bye!<BR>

<DD>Hi, everybody!<BR>
<BR>
I am stopping by for the absolute briefest of visits (ack) 'cause I need to keep getting ready for my big two-week vacation which begins TOMORROW!  (Yay!)<BR>
<BR>
Um,so I'm gonna just assume you all have gone to the Lilith Fair contest site (hosted by XOOM.com) and voted for us...right?  ;-)</SMALL>
