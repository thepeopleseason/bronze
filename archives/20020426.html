<dd>Okay, one last drive-by, 'cause hey -- she's French.<br><br>FangBuster:  Bonjour.  Parting is such sweet, sweet sorrow.  <br><br>*poof -- for real*<br><br>

<dd>Depressed:  I think maybe you just need a hug.  I know when I’m down, Greenberg’s gentle yet manly arms reassure me that it’s all gonna turn out okay.  Sigh.<br><br>Chrsitopher Marlowe:  I would LOVE to adapt several comic book characters for the big screen:  Luke Cage, Batman, Superman, Hellboy, The Authority, Planetary, The Punisher, and, of course, The Sandman.  Just to name a few.<br><br>Stellasurya:  Ep. 19, light-hearted, absolutely.  You’ll cry till you puke.  Promise.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  It was actually very easy to write all the extended dialogue scenes between Spike and Buffy this season.  I just imagined myself naked between them.  Mmm!  Steve sandwich!<br><br>Sapphos:  Can’t comment.  But a daily sponge bath really helps with the shame.<br><br>UpsetTummy:  Aww.  I know how you feel.  Gurgle gurgle.  How ‘bout pancake kisses and chocolate hugs?  Works for me.<br><br>Dallas Viewer:  Thanks again.<br><br>HellaC:  I’d have to say I would have loved to have written for the following shows (in no particular order):  Thirtysomething, The original Star Trek, Star Trek TNG, X-Files, Once and Again, Twin Peaks, Hill Street Blues, and Manimal.<br><br>Fellow Passions Fan:  I know nothing about Halfrek.  Except for the hotness.<br><br>Kaseyjr:  How old should someone be to watch Buffy and Angel?  Heck, depends on your parents.  I was watching stuff ten times more violent and sexy back when I was about six.  And I turned out all right (except for the twitch, but that’s another story).  <br><br><br>Okay, hate to pull the plug, but many things of an unsavory nature need my attention.  Greenberg!  Not on the sofa, you fool!<br><br>

<dd>Toni:  Big News good.  At least for me.  That’s all you’re getting right now!<br><br>Xanderella:  Aww, Xanderella called me cute.  Blush<br><br>LoveAllie:  Evil Spike, Good Spike – doesn’t matter.  Love writing for James.<br><br>Kestra Troi:  Oh, it’s all coming back to me now.  Sadly, Doug and I just plain don’t have the time to be a part of Ghost of the Robot.  There goes my dream of being a rock star.<br><br>Princess of Darkness!:  How are you?!  We’re both blonde now, you know.  I’ll have to send you a picture.  Yup!  Gave Sarah and Michelle the stuff.  Uh… what e-mail was that again?  My old tired brain is failing me.  Bad brain, bad!<br><br>PWAC:  You caught me.<br><br>Biobabe:  You’ll love it here.  You and the beau be sure to drop me an e when you crash land.<br><br>AutumnT:  Grrr!  Arghhh!  Evil Zombie Steve refuses to answer!  Seriously, I love Amber in a deep unnatural way.  Anything bad happens to her, I’ll leave the show.  Or kill Greenberg.  Either way.<br><br>Extra Flamey:  Why, I had the same nickname in college!<br><br>Meggy:  I’ll make some calls, see what I can do for you.<br><br>Angel Rain:  I like a little of both, myself.  The scary demons are great, but I also like a switch-up now and then.  Like Clem.  That guy’s pure gold.<br><br>Ruyen:  Bwhahahaha!  Another step towards world domination!<br><br>Darkguadian:  Uh, all I can tell you is that the Wizard of Oz has never come up in discussion about this season.  But man, that Dorothy was hot!<br><br>AndeeH:  How could I ignore you?   No, I haven’t received the shirt yet.  But I’m deeply touched.  Looking forward to it.<br><br>Sassyeggs:  The Warren whatzit?  Not sure I know what you’re referring to.  Of course, I stopped watching the show after season 2.<br><br>Nikka:  No opinion about Willow’s addiction.  Although you have made me hungry and horny.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  I think Joey Potter should think outside the box and slice off a little Sweet Steve DeKnight.  Grrrr.<br><br>MrsBigPileofDust:  Thanks!<br><br>Xanderella:  Greenberg can actually read well enough to post messages?  Will wonders never cease.  <br><br>Denise:  The news is coming in about two weeks – unless you crafty little monkeys ferret it out first.<br><br><br>Okay, kids!  One more round, then grandpa needs a nap.<br><br>

<dd>Archiac:  My *** is over here.  Could I get a little powder to reduce the glare, please?<br><br>OldManFan:  Glad you asked.  I’m hustling my butt all over town trying to get a feature deal to keep me busy over hiatus.  Alas, the wheels of Hollywood grind slowly if at all.  I’ll keep you posted.<br><br>Singsinthecar:  I’ll check that pic out.  The comic book is going slower than the features.  We’ve been insanely busy.  It’s on my list of things to do over hiatus.<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Bitty Spike!  Is he nekkid?<br><br>CaityCatt:  Thanks for the Dead Things love.  As always, hats off to Jim Cotner for the direction and Lisa Lassek for the editing.  As for the parallels between characters, some of it was intentional, some was subconscious, and some was just wonderful blind luck (especially since I only had 4 days to write it).  <br><br>Impaler General:  Things can always be better.  I think there was a lot of stuff this season that worked, and stuff that didn’t.  Heck, we tried something new.  Bound to be some missteps.  I hope these were offset by some truly wonderful episodes this year.<br><br>Hostile 17:  Dunno.  Willow looks pretty gay to me.  Did I mention the gay hotness?<br><br>Dudley:  Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha – oh!  I wet ‘em!<br><br>Mar:  Too complicated for this simian.  Push the button, monkey!<br><br>Vampire in a basement:  Yeah, I’m staying.  Count yourself lucky, too.  Xbox Spiderman’s calling my name.<br><br>

<dd>Toni:  I’ve been up to nothing but trouble.  Big news to announce soon.  Nope!  Not yet!  Coming soon.<br><br>Dallas Viewer:  I have many thoughts on what you’ve said, but can’t respond due to the spoilage involved.  Just keep watching.<br><br>Judas.  Willow’s hot.  I’m just saying.<br><br>Kestra Troi:  You saw me at 14 Below and didn’t say hi?  Shame on you.  Great show, huh?<br><br>CaittyCat:  Right back at ya.<br><br>Nikka:  No clothes required.  Trust me.<br><br>Miss Tartie:  Hello, sweet little tart(ie).<br><br>Newt!:  We always try to reset for new viewers.  We usually try to avoid awkward exposition, but sometimes you just gotta go there.  I’m thinking next season we should try a Dukes of Hazard freeze frame with a little DeKnight voice over:  “Now what the gang didn’t know…”<br><br>JustLiza:  My goo salutes your goo.<br><br>
