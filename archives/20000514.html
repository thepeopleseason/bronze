<DD>Okay, time for another attempt at sleep.  Thanks for yakking with me.  I'll try to come on tues if I can.  Oh, and for the record, I know you guys like to analyse the shows pretty heavily.  Hidden meanings, relationships, all the fun stuff... I don't know if you'll like the ep, but I guarantee 22 will keep you guys talking for a good long while.  Sorry for all the Qs I didn't have time to answer.  Be well.<BR>
<BR>

Melody, already you're eyeing other producers.  Do our sacred vows mean NOTHING to you?  And yes, Tim's a pretty good-looking guy, and ladies, he's single, which is HOW I WANT HIM, I hate it when my writers get LIVES, it means less WORK!  So BACK OFF!

<DD>The fact is, I can't sleep.  I want to, I should... but here I sit, posting nonsense.  But TO THE DEATH! ****ens is the man.  I love the endless ones:  Little Dorrit, Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend.  He takes me there.<BR>
<BR>
My ultimate crossover would be... hmmm... many answers... well, I wouldn't hate to see Buffy and Batman try to work together... or something with Digiornio's pizza!  Yeah!

<DD>I'm sorry, I'm just not a threadster.  The concept eludes me.  I like it here, where everyone can read everything.<BR>
<BR>
It cracks me up that I can't type ****ens.

<DD>I suspect I'd better say hi to CURLY before something explodes.<BR>
<BR>
And, yeah, I will be at the Wizard con in Chicago this august.  I've never been to Chi, should be nice.  Hopefully I'll have some art from FRAY to show, otherwise I'm not sure what I'll be doin'.  Just 'splorin'.  Plus I'm directing that week so I'll be wicked frazzled.<BR>
<BR>
As for reading, I'm in a Tale of Two Cities.  ****ens is my guy, and I've not read this, so fun.

<DD>Sci-Fi, how DARE you ask me about the gatekeeper trilogy?  The NERVE!  No, not trying to get down on you.  I just can't read ideas (or fanfic, for that matter) and I get the question a lot.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't ask.  And doesn't mean you shouldn't write.  If you need to write, you will.  If you write well, odds are you'll be noticed.  It takes time.  Platitudinous but true.  <BR>
On the subject of Fanfic, by the way, I am aware that a good deal of it is naughty.  My reaction to that is mixed -- on the one hand, these are characters played by friends of mine, and the idea that someone is describing them in full naughtitude is a little creepy.  On the other hand, eroticizing the lives of fictional characters you care about is something we all do, if only in our heads, and it certainly shows that people care.  So I'm not really against erotic fic, and I certainly don't mind the other kind.  I wish I'd had this kind of forum when I was a kid.<BR>
<BR>
So does anyone know what the result of this 'poll' was?

<DD>Luna: what am I doing to kill time between seasons?  Uh, this.  Mostly I'm RELAXING, here with Kai (sorry, Melody) in our house in the East (location not disclosed because my enemies are EVERYWHERE).  Finished mixing ep22 LATE friday night and got the hell out of Dodge.  I'll work, of course, but on non-Buffy related stuff.  Clear the brain.  Tried to work with the writers last week and it was torture, we were just so burnt.  <BR>
"Uh, what if, Buffy had, you know, she could fight a menace or something..."<BR>
<BR>
"Huh?"<BR>
<BR>
"Buffy could, I don't know, be sad or some ****..."<BR>
<BR>
"Doug, stop that."<BR>
<BR>
"Jane hit me first."<BR>
<BR>
"I don't care.  Let's just focus.  Which one is Buffy?"<BR>
<BR>
Etc.So working on other stuff, reading, reading, just fillin' the tank and 'splorin'.  (not really, I just wanted to use that word.  Hoofum!)</SMALL>

<DD>Rabid, what's this about a poll?  And as for all the various women-and-hygiene pitches, there's a time and a place for everything, and I think it's called fanfic.

<DD>Hoofum, forget Willow and Tara, let's talk about YOUR NAME!  I just like saying it.  Hoofum.  I'm gonna say it for no reason.  Plus I don't give out spoilers, except occasionally, and they're almost always lies.  Ask anyone.

<DD>SAM, I do of course remember you.  I felt bad I wasn't able to talk to you at any length, but I did have the fun of saying to Diego (the guy who was with me) "I'm someone's Idol" until he had to make me shut up.  <BR>
<BR>
As for the return of oz/dru/jenny/faith/that guy in that ep, it's all based on their availability and our shifting storylines.  I'd like to see them all again, and come to think of it, when it comes to this show I often get what I want.  But you never know.

As for what happened between Willow and Tara when the candle went out, the answer is: whatever you wanted to happen.<BR>

And i'm glad SOMEBODY finally noticed how shapely my feet are!

<DD>Snuck out to read Amber's posts from Friday.  Liked the word 'splorin' very much.  See Slave has bailed (and taken our child) and Melody has asked me to stop bothering her.  Not doin' great with the wives.  At least Margaret Thatcher still loves me. (God help me.)

<DD>Melody, great news for you:  I'm a Mormon.  I already have several wives, so we can get hitched any time!  So far I'm married to KAI, obviously, but also Emma, Robia, that lady who played the teacher in that ep first season, James, Slave2Faith (as punishment for her EVIL LIFEstyle), and Margaret Thatcher (as punishment for mine).  So I think you'll fit right in.  You should know just a few things about me, though, to make sure we're compatable.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm a Cancer, on the cusp of Gemini.<BR>
I never speak to any of my wives except Kai.<BR>
I suspect everyone is against me and I frequently wrap myself in tissue paper.<BR>
I shout "TO THE DEATH!" often and uncontrollably.<BR>
I have never made the sex as it frightens me.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from that I'm sweet, amiable -- I like cats, especially with a light truffle sauce -- and I know we'll get along great if we marry.  Please send pic and check for 80,000 dollars made out to my chin.<BR>
<BR>
Awaiting the hallowed event.... Joss.

<DD>Hey, Slavey.  Trust me when I say you're not the first woman to tell me that. (Sigh).  X-Lander: Buffy and Digiornio's pizza?  That's gotta be the lamest crossover idea I've ever heard.<BR>
<BR>
Don't know when the DVD is coming out.  I DON'T KNOW, Dammit!

<DD>Jamie, asking me to ask James Marsters to marry you?  Okay, that's beyond perverse.  I know you're a fan and all, but this crosses the line: you asking me if you can marry James Marsters when you're ALREADY MARRIED TO HIM.  Look, we were all pretty drunk, and I'm not sure a Maitre'D can really legally marry people, but I still think you'd REMEMBER it, for God's sake.  James was crying the next morning -- now I understand why.  I heard he's going for an annullment and that's just what you deserve.  He pledged his LIFE to you and you couldn't even stay awake.  Plus he said you mumbled "Donny Most, take me, Donny Most" in your sleep, which is both frightening and rude.  So don't look for any help from me -- James has to move on.  Anybody else wanna marry him?  Angle Man?  Come on, he's cute.... He could do the accent for you...

<DD>Melody, didn't you get that whole "I'm omnipotent" thing?  I'm like santa claus, except I never give people stuff.  I do read fanmail, though I almost never have time to reply to it.  The Fresh Aire interview convinced me that I have to stop doing interviews -- I felt SO dull and incoherent.  Glad to hear at least someone thought otherwise.  But if it's dull and incoherent you like, you'll LOVE my commentary on the DVD of the first Buffy ep.  Talk about mumbly-rambly.  There's a reason I hide behind other characters.  Buffy, Xander and Friendly Wayne are way more articulate than I am, except maybe for wayne.
