<DD> well, I want to thank everyone for nice comments.  Here's how something like this happens.  We all sit around scratching our heads.  Then Joss says something to the effect of "can Holland come back all dead and take Angel on an elevator ride to hell, but end up right back where he started?" then I just try to work out the details.  The bush is burning, and its name is Joss.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm gone for now.  But thanks again and have a great night.

<DD>ED1: To answer your question: The music before Angel sees Darla at the end is called "My God I Am So Freakin' Depressed" Music.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

THX, yes, Tim had me slaving away at it night and day! I didn't write the muzak, but I agreed with Tim wholeheartedly that we should have it in the elevator.<BR>
<BR>
ED1faith: Not offended by the odd stray "w".<BR>
<BR>
Amberlynne: I missed the contraversy though I saw a few furious flames scrolling back! <BR>
<BR>
Great discussions going on here guys and gals! I'd love to hop right in but I don't wanna give anything away...

<DD>Shelly - Since I wrote "Real Me" I feel somewhat qualified to answer your questions...<BR>
<BR>
1) Harmony was seen being bitten by a vampire during the Graduation Day finale of season 3.  We were to assume she perished, but she appeared again in episode 2 of season four (the brillant Espenson ep. "Harsh Light of Day) as a vamp.<BR>
<BR>
2) Dawn is a mystery that will unfold over the course of a few episodes.  All will be made clear by ep. 5 (Doug Petrie's masterpiece "No Place Like Home.")<BR>
<BR>
3) Tara's also a mystery.  You'll understand all by ep. 6 ("Family" written and directed by your hero and mine, Joss W).<BR>
<BR>
Hope that helps.

<DD>Arise, kronos.  There will be no toadying for me.<BR>
<BR>
Unless it's Allyson, I guess.<BR>
<BR>
Spooky - It's called BALL & CHAIN - based on a comic book about a divorcing couple who become superheroes.
