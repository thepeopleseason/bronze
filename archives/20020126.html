<dd>Christopher Marlowe - What are you talking about?  Steve was let go from the show weeks ago.  Is he still showing up here?  That scamp.<br><br>Lilyana - Oh, great.  You just made me throw up.  Quit poking me!  (Was that not the response you were looking for?)<br><br>Nightspirit - It upsets me that ANYONE is doing ANYTHING with Marti without me.  (I'm the jealous type.)<br><br>TAMZ - Tried the mix and match socks thing.  People shunned me and called me a freak so I went back to color coordinating.<br><br>

<dd>IG - As to the whole Buffy wasn't in heaven idea... There's an interesting answer on that question in episode 17.<br>I have no idea what Marti revealed to Wanda so I couldn't say.<br><br>Thanks very much, G. Lucie.  More fun starts in a week or so.<br><br>Darkguardian - It's a Janie, all right.  Funny and oh, so odd.  TV Guide gave it a rave.<br>And, hey, And NOTHING like Sweeney Todd.  (Accept for ANgela Lansbury being the big bad, but other than that...)<br><br>

<dd>Zeus - Marti and I will not be appearing on the show in the near
future, but will be starting a 16 city concert tour. Watch for us to
come to YOUR hometown! <br><br> snuzeggy - Just something I whipped
up. Hey, we can't all be JW, can we? <br><br> Scource - FOr that matter
didn't she make him d**kless, too? Just asking. (Hey, wait a
minute. That means I don't have one either! Awww!)<br><br>
