<DD>Hi DeMoriel.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderphile - Be all the expert on Xander you can be.  Nick did ask me to marry him once.  That's one of the things I have on tape - btw.  (So let's begin the blackmailing right away!)  Oh wait.  I almost forgot.  He's Nick.  NO way.<BR>
<BR>
And also Amber is very sweet indeed.  You are right about that.<BR>
<BR>
Paris Angel - Yep.  And Bailey still lives the last time I saw him.  Hope he gets a promotion to civilian now that the Initiative is destroyed.<BR>
<BR>
DingoBaby - Was that IMPACT?  You must be in the UK.  Sophia will be in SHINE and SUGAR soon in England.  And the Women of Buffy issue of FEMME FATALES is next month.  Both Sophia and Marti are in it.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, thanks for the kindness and understanding of the sudden emotional sitch I found myself facing.  Please direct anyone who wants to say anything positive or negative directly to me in private.  And thus keep the board free for the normal chatter.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for that.  jeffprui@idt.net<BR>
<BR>
I'll now flee the scene.  Enjoy the final show.  And all the best to everyone.<BR>

<DD>nil8r - I'm thinking that "Mission Impossible" might be my theme song lately.  <BR>
<BR>
Erin - I have to admit that I have not trained in all the time I've been on BUFFY.  I guess this summer is my chance to start getting back into shape finally.<BR>
<BR>
Sophia trains with punching and kicking with ankle weights and she rides the stationary bike.  Plus, she likes to hit the bag or focus mitts now and then.  And she still does a bit of weight training too.  Her routine can be found in a recent FITNESS magazine article (although they claimed it was Sarah's to see more mags I guess)<BR>
<BR>
prophet 6 - Karen Sheperd does most of the Eliza stuff.  The thing I do like about her is that she came over to my place and practiced "action acting" with me.  That means putting extra body movement and facial expressions into your shots.  It edits with the stunt double better that way and adds to the illusion.  It's hard for Sarah to do that though because it feels like overacting to a lot of actors.  Some pick it up right away.<BR>
<BR>
MattW - Whew.  That would be a book in itself.  It's not the most stable profession.  I can tell you that.  Your life can hang on a mood or a whim.  NOw soda can collecting (my next project) now that's a job for a man;)<BR>

<DD>Buffy Angel - I'm didn't mean to ignore your questions before.  I just have no idea about that stuff.  But you can ask me how thick the cable was that I used to hold up the Gentlemen outside in the street.  Or how much pressure we had to use to snap the stunt double into the trash during the Angel/Riley fight.  Or even how I choreographed sometihng.  But travels and romances - that I couldn't say.  Just the stunts for me.  Sorry.  Wish I could help more.<BR>
<BR>
Opus - I simply choreographed everything on the spot.  About an hour before we shot.  And some of the big battle I put together with my guys while the cameras were being moved in-between shots.  That's how fast you have to be able to think because things change so much.<BR>
<BR>
But certain gags and stunts I had prepared the day before shooting and storyboarded out.  It took a about six hours to rig the wires there.  I went to SPORTS CHALET that morning when I saw the foil they were using to get some foil of my own and took the opportunity to hide an air bag under it.  That allowed for wider shots without seeing the bag that the stunt guys flew into.

<DD>Dark Lady - I don't know if you are talking about the Willow/Tara thing or not.  I wasn't here for that.  But I would only say one thing there (and I pray to God this doesn't send a million attacks my way) since I never got to put my own feelings on that out there.<BR>
<BR>
The Willow/Tara relationship was really the only time that I've seen anything on tv that sort of represented some of the relationships of some of my own friends.  I mean, I've seen the whole "Look we're two hot chicks.  Don't we excite you?" deal from BASIC INSTINCT.  And I also have seen the "club kid" representation and the whole "sleep around" thing.  But I've never really seen a REAL couple represented.  You know the kind I mean?  The people who simply love each other.  But I saw it that night on BUFFY.  <BR>
<BR>
That's all.  Please don't flame me.  My clothes are still smoking from the last batch.

<DD>rubyslayer - I don't know anything about David being engaged.  That may even be a rumor that is false.  I have no idea about that at all.  Last time I saw him we were just beating the crap out of that ultra-tough Solier guy (Mr. Riley) into the middle of the night.  We only joked around about that stuff.  I have no idea about the other.  <BR>
<BR>
OPUS - Karen and Sophia did both double Faith earlier on ANGEL, but the Blind Girl was both acted by and stunted by Jennifer Badger.  She is our regular Cordy stunt double.

<DD>Evil - Todd (the master of make up) makes them so neat to look at.  Then I would come along and mess it up and he'd just fix them right back to total vampness.  He is one awesome guy.  (and his marguritas are super nice too)<BR>
<BR>
Erin - Eliza has been great to me since the day I met her.  I love her.  She even came on and posted with me once (but we were not able to say who she was because Faith had not appeared yet)<BR>
<BR>
Spikey - I'm still working my way thru the emails.  I"ll get it though.  Thank you for the thoughts.  Hey - I can thank you right here too;)  Thank you.<BR>
<BR>
BuffySgrl - School Hard - That was Tae Kwon Do champ (a real one) Clay Barber doing a 360 jump round kick (in an Angle wig)<BR>
<BR>
Sophia did more of a Thai style follow through round kick in mid-air by springing off the headstone.  It's more of a movie kick than anything else.;)

<DD>Buffy's Angel - Yes.  I must admit that the sexy part of David is true.  I met him long before there was even a Buffy movie and the girls at the party we met at were dropping like flys at the sight of him.  I just thought, "Now that guy could be an actor."  And so he was.<BR>
<BR>
And sure, Sarah is tiny.  She wants it that way.  She prefers the thin model look.  It's her choice.  Me?  I like all types.  I look for the inside first and then the outside.  Of course, not every guy is a fan of internal organs like me.  But I'm just Hannibalish that way.  You can probably tell.<BR>
<BR>
Carita - I think I have the web addy saved, but would it be possible for you to post it?  I'll write it down and give it to her.

<DD>BeMu - lol  *I wouldn't say that story unless I thought David wouldn't mind.  He is a sport about that.  I only wish someone would call me a Clydesdale instead of "my little pony."  Why oh why must I be punished so?  Why can't I be the Clydesdale for once?<BR>
<BR>
St. Germian - It will take some time to return the e.  I"m working as fast as I can and I do have some non-Buffy projects that I have to attend to.  But I am determined to answer everyone who was kind enough and thoughtful enough to email me and take it off the PB.  I'll be in touch.<BR>

Moment - I plan on walking up and down the beach with a metal detector and mumbling mostly.

<DD>BeMu - I was standing in the parking lot at the time.  I made the joke about the left eye because that gives you a hint of the anatomy of the proud man at the other end of the lot.  He has a lot to be proud of.  Wish I were that proud.  That's all I can say about that.  <BR>
<BR>
btw - Do you like horses?  Just kidding.  don't kill please.<BR>
<BR>
AKA Becker - Yes.  A ton.  And I will answer every one of them.  Including yours and anyone elses.  How's the p.a. thing working out for you?  Remember to keep coolant in the car.  It's gonna be a hot one this summer I'll bet.<BR>
<BR>
Heidi - Sarah never had a brown belt.  What happended was that she was auditioning for the Cordy part on the show and she wanted to be Buffy.  So that was a little exageration to help with that.  Later she was introduced to the crew as the new Buffy and they were told that she was a Martial artist.  Quickly it was discovered that was not completely true.  Or even partially true.  For the past three years she has picked up only very basic movements that she can perform for the camera.  But no real Martial artist (who is honest) could really say that she was one of us.  She is a great actress however.<BR>
<BR>
Cursed Angel - I'm with you.  I'm a bit cursed lately too.  (I was the stunt coordinator until a few days ago)<BR>
<BR>
Oh ... and Sophia sez, "hi everyone and thank you all for the lovely birthday wishes."

<DD>lazy dreamer - Sophia does that.  It's called a kip-up.  Marc and James can do it too.  Just a fancy way of getting to your feet. hehe<BR>
<BR>
Mark - I'm just all into the filmmaking side of Martial arts now.  So I like whatever works for the project.  I take both Korean and Chinese style kicks and mix them with trapping hands and exagerated boxing punches alot.  Plus, I'm always looking for ways to use the equipment at hand or my surroundings if allowed to.<BR>
<BR>
Buffy's Angel - I did do the Power Rangers, yes.  And Sophia did the Pink Ranger stunts for the last year I was there (and the movie too)<BR>
<BR>

<DD>KAM - That was Kevin Foster doing those stunts for Marc.  They would kill me (even worse than they already have) if I let anything like THAT happen to him.  That was a gymnastic train wreck off a mini-tramp.<BR>
<BR>
Mark - Look here!  I've had just about enough of that.  I never claimed to be cool.  I only ... oh wait.  Compliment.  Yikes.  Sorry.  Just been on edge a bit, y'know?  Thanks.  You're cool as well.  In fact, you emit huge coolness.  You are freezing me right now and may I say thank you very much for that as it is 107 degrees where I am right now.

<BR>
I'm going to always put it in the email addy when I post too.  Just in case.  (and if I eer get a virus I'll just shift over to another computer.  I got plenty of them, what with me being semi-nerdy and all)<BR>
<BR>
I still enjoy and love the show and all the other actors and most of the people behind the scenes too.  And especially the kindness of the Bronzers I go way back with.  I know you only mean well by that gesture.<BR>
<BR>
I still won't spoil anything on the show though.  So don't ask about next week's stunts.  I'll just say that there is only a bit at the end really.  And I've already said that this is the one episode that I just didn't really "get" when I read it.  That doesn't mean that it won't be great though.

<DD>Erin - stunt question:  Yes.  I did choreograph the sword fight.  I'm glad you like it.<BR>
<BR>
Again - it's just a stunt question so please don't get upset at the over 4 per hour deal.  I don't think most people will mind too much.  Well ... most anyway.<BR>
<BR>
KAM - Yeah.  At first I was going to get a seperate crew to shoot tons of stunts for a couple of days and then have main unit bring the actors in for two more day.  That got the budget ax.  So the toned it down to basically nothing in the script.  I asked the director to let me try to do as much as I could and went in and pre-rigged for stunts.  So we wound up with TONS of footage of action.  A lot of which is not in the show.  In only two days we got more accomplished than anyone ever dreamed possible.  So it was very successful.  I just wish you could see it all.  (If only the show were an hour and a half)

<DD>Cosmic Bob - I hope this isn't called "over posting" if I answer a real Buffy-related stunt question.<BR>
<BR>
I did one with Sophia slamming into the Aly   stunt double (Michelle Sebek) and then had Sarah grab the real Aly   and fall onto a pad.  Edit together and it mixes well.  Tastes great.  Looks good.  Mucho safe -o.  And all of that.<BR>
<BR>
I also put together a quick fight in which Marc Blucas got to deck a bunch of the demon/vamp horde.  I don't know if it was in the final cut though.  I'll have to look.  I know that he was happy to finally get to smack a whole bunch of guys at once.  It was fun for him.  And of course, James got some shots in too.  He was so happy.

I'm glad that you seem so negative and that it shows.  But why is it that you and these others that I've never seen before should suddenly start in on me?  I don't know who you are.  If you don't want to talk to me then don't start in on me.  Pretend that I don't exist as you would anyone that seems to "annoy" you.  That seems fair enough.  That way I can post to my friends and you can post about Sarah's tattoo or something.  Works good.<BR>

Never-the-less, I've had the chance to meet many cool and very real people over the years from this very board and I'm happy about that.  That has been the great thing about it for me.<BR>

I've been able to answer over 800 emails to people who have been very kind in their support.  It has helped me a great deal and I do appreciate it.  I've still got tons to go but I am trying my best to answer everyone on an individual basis.  As I always have.<BR>

<SMALL>(Mon May 22 10:51:01 2000 169.132.153.128)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Hi.  Yes, it's me.  I know that they've made it impossible now for anyone to know if it's really me or someone pretending.  Anyone can use my name now, I suppose, and the ip I use is one of the most popular around.  So how can I prove when it's me for certain?  I can't.  Unless you email me.<BR>
<BR>
Which brings me to what I want to say:  I've been posting here for years now and I've made lots of friends.  They know me to be honest.  Even when being dishonest could actually benefit me.  <BR>
<BR>
I work in a business where deception and fraud is a way of life.  If you don't want to participate you can get thumped on the head for it.  <BR>
<BR>
What will happen now is that it will be made difficult for anyone to know when they are really talking to me.  And lots of nasty things will be repeated until no one really knows or understands what I originally intended to say.  Only that some mean guy must have hurt "their" Sarah.  It is amazing to me to see this psychological phenmonena taking place.  <BR>
<BR>
All I did was attempt to make a page for my friends and Joss to see that told of my true feelings without any dishonesty whatsoever.  I was mocked for it by someone I had looked up to.  And my heart was broken.  And I got angry.   Okay then.  I can be just as guilty of blind hero worship as the next guy - and I should know better.<BR>
<BR>
As far as anything that people keep taking out of context about what I said:  I used the term "fatherless Princess" because there is a man who is very adept at manipulation and he saw an opportunity to move in and make for himself a base for control on the show.  He has it in two places now.  And it works well for him.  This happens alot.  Sometimes actresses will maniputlate producers in a similar way.  Check out the movie, "THE BIG PICTURE" starring Kevin Bacon and watch Teri Hatcher's character for an accurate portrayal of what I mean.  <BR>
<BR>
People see someone going through something and, low and behold, a sneaky fellow with his own agenda shows up with flowers and lots of "guidance."   These types roam Hollywood like hunters.  And yes, one latched onto the Princess.  He's not going anywhere.  Unlike many of those who work under him.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah chooses not to talk to her Dad.  That's fine.  Lots of people are like that.  However, my father and mother both died while I was trying to make this show.  My father at the very start and my mother this last Halloween.  I  cannot talk to them about anything.  The only person in this whole thing who is really "fatherless" in reality is me.  So please do lay off that bit and try to understand my intent.  I don't know how to make it any clearer than that.<BR>
<BR>
As far as anyone daring to call me a liar:  They should recall one little thing.  I have this  camcorder.  It has black tape over the red light (so as not to disturb filming) and sits quietly recording things.  It recorded many of the things I saw and heard by sheer accident.  Who was fondling who.  Who was treating others like dirt.  And even how people feel HONESTLY vs. what they say in public for the benefit of PR and their own job security.  Have I ever once shown this to anyone?  No way!  I have always been about the boosting of stunts and stunt people.  That's all.  The people who know me will attest to that.  I really don't want to deal with any of that sorted mess for any reason.  I want to stay out of that.  But it is real.  Anyone who wants to attack me or hurt my career should remember that.  I am honest.  To a fault, maybe.  And I was pushed into revealing some things one painful day that I never intended to because I was upset and being attacked and I'd given up on the one that I had always had faith in before. I have only tried to defend myself with what I have said thus far. I have no intention of doing anything else other than talking nicely with friends who like the same stuff as me.  So enough with the personal attacks on me.  I am honest.  AND I can prove it.  Please keep that in mind.  <BR>
<BR>
Yes, many on the crew are not returning.  A few because of what happened to me.  I know because they told me themselves.  And they are happy that one of us had the guts to say SOMETHING for once.  So at least I did take a little load off of them and make them smile.  That's some consolation to me.<BR>
<BR>
I want everyone to enjoy the show for what it is.  A TV show.  That's all.  Remember that images are tightly controlled when you deal with a multi-million dollar franchise.  You will be told and shown what you are supposed to be to keep that untainted.  No matter what the cost to human beings along the way.  Especially here because, although many think of this as their own community, it is actually set up and monitored by th

Enjoyed it alot but agree that it was too short, as was Pandora. I'm currently going through the witch chronicles. Otherwise thank you all. I will certainly be back, if not in the lovely Miss Ambers company, then by meself. I really must go, have work and all, yuck!

<DD><blue351>It's weird getting recognized.  Was recognized at IKEA MAJORLY COOL!  And I am trying to answer the fanmail.  Which has all been so sweet and supportive.  As for teh summer, well, just chillin' for now.  Buffy goes back decently soon so totally excited about that.  YEAH!!  You guys have no idea how awesome that set is.  Everyone is sooo nice and naked!!!!  And that Christian Kane is very cute.  Been watching ANGEL.  It's just as cool As Buffy.  Rich hasn't seen the wolfram hart lawyer, but he'd like him, too!

<DD>Hey guys, thanx for being so kind to the majestic Richard.  I hope to stick around the buffy realm for awhile, but all that is up to Mr. Whedon (who's like the nicest boss I've ever had - richard said I'm kissing a**  but it's true!!!)  And KAi rocks too!!  Becoming a  psychiatrist is very time consuming.  Years of study and residency.  - On the whole lesbian thing- I AM SOOOO GLAD that it has made people feel better about  their sexual preference.  That it's okay to love whomever you want.  MAle female Adam or not!  And believe George -adam- is HOT!<BR>
On the caramel or chocolate thing.  WEll, not really a candy kinda girl.  How about peppermint!  Red, white and spicy!  Kinda cheesy, but oh well.  You know, the more I think about it...  Definitely not into body functions.  Ew Gross!  Richard thinks it was about the use of foodstuffs during relations/.  I thought it meant something else!!!  I am a perv! <BR>

<DD>ok, Richard again.. if you want a more detailed answer on my Buffy man pick, here you go. I think I'd have to go with Xander. I have some strange thing for him. Riley is beautiful too. Hes got that body. And under all that Demon, Adam is pretty hot too. You asked for it. Lets see, as far as authors, I'm not into that intellectual stuff like Amber, I'm an Anne Rice freak myself. And thanks "Polite Bronzer". Blind dates are kinda scary but hmmm, might take you up in that one..

<DD>The posture thing.  I slunch. It's true.  Horrible posture, but definitely working on it for myself and tara.  We both have been amazed at how BIG our bosom has become!!  Yipes!  That's on account of Nick -wardrobe- who is in favor of good underwire support giggle.  I thank you for the wedding bells, but I'm thinking single is good for know.  But I bet you'd make a dashing groom.  "Lover, you should have come over"  that's a song I wsa singing tonight as I walked the dog.  rich is gonna post oin the next one.  He's got magic fingers!

<DD>WEll, my dad's a psychiatrist, so the whole sexual absue thing, well, I'll have to give him a call about that.  Thank you KImber.  I meant what I said.  You are beautiful inside.  No more no less.  I love jeff Buckley!! He rocks!!  Was such a beauty, too!  I have no life.  I love to fix things around the house.  It is soo much fun!

<DD>Well, I have a dalmation named Penny and a fat cat named benneton.  And if I could have dinner with anyone...?  Hmmm...  For fun, let's say, Justin Paige.  This kid I knew in Highschool, but have lost touch with.  he sat next to me in World Religions and we made fun of, like, everything.<BR>
I hope that Tara becomes more 'comfortable' with herself and finds her voice.  I think right now she's still a little shy.  BUT WAIT FOR THE SEASON FINALE!!!!  OH MY Joss!!!

You guys have no idea how nice it is to come and say hello here.  Je suis tres bien.  And that's about all the french I am good for.  Ich kan Deutsche sprechen. A little, too.  My friend Richard says hello, by the way.  He's very cute!
