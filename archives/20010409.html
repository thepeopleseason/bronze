<DD>StGermain - I read Penlind's post and am moved beyond words.  I will pass it on to Joss tomorrow.  <BR>
<BR>
Please tell her and Rye that Cairo is a very special girl and so say all of us at BUFFY and ANGEL.<BR>
<BR>
And "Cairo" is an incredibly beautiful name.  I hope to use it in a script someday.<BR>
<BR>
Up, up and away...

Would somebody please tell Isis I owe her an apology?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you.

<DD>Slayergrl99 - I got the cure for your headache right he-- Whoa!  Hey, family board!<BR>
<BR>
Dunlin - Enjoy my socks.  And try to get my pants back.<BR>
<BR>
To the rest of you... Take care, be well, and keep watching the skis.

<DD>Sorry, Seska.  Isis has to say it.  I find her unwillingness to cowtow to me strangely compelling and I must have a "hi" from her or you will get noting from me.  Do you here?!  NOTHING!  (Maniacal Laughter)<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - Xander in Speedo -- I already done that.  Must grow as a writer of male erotica.

<DD>Micaiah - Glad you like it.  The next Tuesday's ANGEL is mine.  Hope you enjoy it.  (No naked Lindsey, people.  In fact, no Lindsey.  Sorry.)  Just pretend you all see a tiny naked Christian at the lower left corner of your screen at all times and I'm sure it will increase everyone's appreciation for the episode.

<DD>Boo -- Are you Steve's Webmaster?  Go ahead and sign me up.  That boy's going places.  (And if anyone brings my pants into this, I'll never post again.)<BR>
<BR>
MissMoneyPenny -- I'm no fun at all.  Haven't you heard?<BR>
<BR>
Isis -- I'm not going to tell you until you say hi to me like all the others.  And be nice about it.  And genuine.  "cause I'll know if you're just being stuck-up.

<DD>MedusA - Hit me with the drink, barkeep.  As for the signed thingee, send me a SASE, with a little note reminding me what it's for, and I'll see what I can do.<BR>
<BR>
And before you guys start getting ideas about Steve D. and I, let me just state right now clearly... We're lovers.  So get your minds out of the gutters.
