<DD>Gehenna - I'm the guy who rushes over to the Joss and says.. "Awww.  Does Buffy have to get her ass kicked again?  Can I do a MATRIX gag?  Blood or no?  How come Angel gets the expensive equipment and I only get a piece of candy glass?"<BR>
<BR>
Then I dare to bring up the fact that I think it's really cool the way that Angel can walk in the daylight now and Joss bitch-slaps me across the room.  I then draw a little storyboard of the event and stick it into the Buffy Fight Choreography.  That's about how my day goes...

<DD>Ajo - I didn't do that stunt in ANGEL, but I can tell you about it.  Mike Massa (Angel dbl.) was in New York that day so Chad Stahelski (Keanu Reeves stunt double & the Angel double for the fight with Buffy in the mall in S2) did it.  Chad ignited his coat by having rubber cement on fire and protective gel and clothes underneath.  He tackled the other stunt guy and the water put out the fire.  <BR>
<BR>
carl - When the guys and I saw the opening of the last ANGEL ep. with Spike commenting on Angel saving the girl - I cracked up.  Those are the exact words we always say about Angel on the set.  It actually sounds exactly like the voice of Joss (except with a Brit accent)  That's how Joss talks.  <BR>
<BR>
"No.  Don't touch the hair.  Come to my Angelmobile..."  I laughed and then brooded before crying.  I was so caught off guard by that.

<DD>friday - Yes.  Watch the teaser of ep. 5 "BEER BAD" for cool Buffy who doesn't get her butt kicked for a while at first.<BR>
<BR>
There I said it.  Now I must go and punish myself.  Did I mention the plot?  No... okay maybe I do have self control after all...<BR>
<BR>
No wait... I'm sure I can trust you guys.  The plot is about Angel being gay.   It'll rock.  Hearts will break.  There will be some brooding involved and then Xander makes a funny before the sadness falls over Sunnydale.<BR>

<DD>horizon - And thank you very much.  That was Steve Tartalia doubling Spike.  I was the jumpy guy behind the monitors.  The one that the DP and AD kept looking at like they wanted to kill him for making the fight so long.  hehe  Thus the devil connotation is well deserved.  To hell with the acting --I love ITCHY & SCRATCHY.  "They fight and fight and fight fight fight.  Fight fight fight - fight fight fight.  The Itchy and Scratchy Shooooow!"*<BR>

<BR>
Oh - you knew that one already?  #$@@^!**&^% - it.<BR>
I have to think up a really good rumor.  Especially since nobody bought into my Angel is gay theory.

<DD>Anais - The fact that the sets are not ready until just before we shoot and the ceilings are low and we have to be so careful.  I'd love to have a place with high ceilings for rigging and balconys and things to fall from and fight all over.  I try to use the environment - but it's not always easy to do with our sets.  We try (Though the set dressers go insane when they see me coming)

OkiLLbyte - I do believe that Jossyland is a new theme park that is being developed in Florida.  There's the maze of books/  The slide through the manhole & glass window crash ride / And the Buffy-can't-drive ride.  (In that one people are required to hang onto the outside of the drivers door like a dead teen and try to avoid getting their heads lobbed off by a passing mail box)  It's all fun in Jossyland!<BR>

<DD>rain - Hi and thanks.  All I can say is that she really smells good up close when I get to catch her in my arms.  Sometimes I notice the guys hanging out along the edge of the set being held back by security.  For some reason they appear to want to kill me.  I have no idea why.  Then I brush her hair aside and say.  "Nice job.  Let's go again."  Even though there's no film in the camera.  It's just fun to watch her jump into my arms.  tee hee <BR>
<BR>
Sorry.  I laughed too much like a giddy school girl that time.

<DD>aardwolfe - I think what you dislike most of the time doesn't have anything to do with the actual choreography of the fights, but it has more to do with the script and WHY these people are fighting in the first place.  <BR>
<BR>
I often think of a line from a certain movie by one Mr. Mel Brooks.  In it the Sunnydale Cop of that particular village utters the immortal line:  "Violence is an ugly thing.  Unt I sink itz about time vee had sum!"  <BR>
<BR>
I keep looking for any place to insert more violence on tv.  After all, according to our Congress and the Parents Groups that held hearings regarding POWER RANGERS, I am the devil.  I can't think of a reason to disagree with that statement.<BR>
<BR>
So I quote from the classic animated film HEAVY METAL:  "Death to all who oppose us!"<BR>
<BR>
*now I quickly search for any other silly film I can quote*<BR>
<BR>
Oh yes... ENTER THE DRAGON: <BR>
Bruce Lee to student - "Hit me."  Doesn't get any more direct than that.<BR>
<BR>
Ummmm ... POWER RANGERS:  "Watch my monster GROWWWW!"  No wait.  That was a quote from Joss the other day.

Angle Man - A friend of ours (Michiko Nishiwaki) doubles Kelly most of the time.  But in HK both Michiko and Sophia were sometimes doubled by the same HK guy who was working on MartiAL LAW.  I'm sure they've put him in.  In HK there are no real stunt women.  It's just skinny guys in wigs.  The only non-Asian they might have used could have been Bridgit Riely (who was my yellow Ranger on POWER RANGERS) I remember her doing an episode and seeing her thrown from a boat.  But she was doubling the blonde actress at the time.

<DD>buggo - I think it was the meaness of it.  If you think about it:  Buffy vs. Angel (all three times)  Faith vs. Buffy (twice) and then this one with Spike.  They all had the element of being an important event.  Two characters who are really pissed and are trying to bash each other.  Much different feeling than when vamp jr. pokes his head out of a bush and gets staked.  I think those are more comic.  The ones that grab people the most have to do with two characters and their big moment of confrontation.  Don't you think so?  Still ... they all have a place.  They are just different.  But the ones that grab are the important confrontations.  It depends on how the writers set it all up.  No doubt about it.

<SMALL>(Sun Oct 24 14:15:01 1999 169.132.153.56)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>aardwolfe - Yeah.  I remember asking him directly about that scene.  I asked him if we shouldn't shoot Trick and his gang watching from the crane and having Trick look at the set-up  in order to give the audience a clue as to what he was planning.  He told me he opted for the surprise of it and so I just tried to make a good Faith fight and came up with the idea of having Trick use the straps from the crate to choke and swing the injured Buffy around.  <BR>
<BR>
So far everyone has helped an injured and dazed Buffy but me.  I am hoping to make an unscheduled appearance someday as the regular guy who saves Buffy from a vamp.  I figure if the other Scoobies can - then why not me?  I wanna save Buffy too.<BR>
<BR>
A similar thing happened during the Spike/Buffy fight.  I saw the ton of extras milling about the campus during the acting lead-up to the fight and I asked the director how I could have Spike start the fight with them around.  He told me not to worry.  He said that he would have Buffy follow Spike to another location away from the crowd.  So I went to the other location and made the fight.  When it aired it looked like she never left the crowded area.  What happened there?  I have no idea if it was shot and cut out or what.  But the fight was taking place in a whole different  side of the campus.  It just didn't look that way.  ***sigh***

<DD>Angle Man - I was there on the set of MartiAL LAW one day when that happened.  My buddy (who is an excellent Chinese stuntman/actor) came out with an afro wig and painted to look black.  It was Arsenios first episode.  I pulled him aside and asked him what the hell he was thinking.  But that's how they do it in Hong Kong.  Everybody is Chinese.  To them it's no big deal.  They are having to learn about all the ideas we have regarding race.  Over there using racial slurs against all non-Chinese is considered good form in movies.  That's what the hero does.  They are figuring out that they are no longer in HK now.  The old HK no longer exists.  It's a brave new world and there are other races to deal with up close and in person.

<DD>Angle Man - I think the BUFFY cast has a better understanding of what we do on that show than the average actor ever could.  They see it everyday.  Just the other night we had a brand new director from DAWSON'S CREEK on board.  He tries to do everything in one looooong take.  Which is not always good for action scenes.   He had already met with the DP and myself to find out how we did the staking vanishings, so when Sarah arrived he started in by talking to her as if she had no idea what a staking was.  She was just rolling her eyes and looking at me for help so I chimed in by telling him that she has actually staked about a hundred times now.  She is familiar with the concept.  It's only new to the guest stars and new directors.  Our cast be down with vamp-whupage.

<DD>Motorcycle - haha (sung to the tune of the kid on THE SIMPSONS)<BR>
<BR>
Vanilla Slayer - Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Angle - I try to hire people who match the race of the person.  Sometimes you can.  Once in a while you can't.  <BR>
<BR>
One time I spike to every Asian guy in the business trying to get one to double this guy for a descender fall from a helicopter.  They were all too afraid.  You see the helicopter was above a battle ship and was being fired at and the wind was kicking up.  There was a chance of hitting the  deck of the ship or being set on fire.  So I did it myself.  Sometimes it involves skills.<BR>
<BR>
On occasion someone who is the perfect race doesn't look anything like the actor, but the guy who really isn't of that race does AND he has the skills to do the job that the other doesn't.  I'd rather have someone aim a car at my kneecaps who can drive than to have a guy whose grandmother came from the same part of the world as the actor being doubled, but who will get me killed.<BR>
<BR>
So it works both ways.  We always try to please everyone.  But if it's a choice of getting the job done or failing - then just get the job done at all costs.  By any means necessery as Spike Lee would say.

<DD>Angle Man - He does love it.  But he also wants Spike to look good and so he is very easy to work with.  You can see him spin around with a vicious expression in a close-up and then in the side shot you see Steve Tartalia doing the actual kick.  But he did do the kick to Sophia's shoulder while talking to her.  And when I saw that he could kip-up I had him do that in close shots too.  He's very good to work with.  Sophia said the way that he threw her onto the table was excellent.  There is a technique to it that allows the stuntperson being thrown to control everything and most actors can't seem to be able to do that.  James does it.  He's great.

<DD><blue>Narrator - Remember when we set James hand on fire on BUFFY?  Now his hair too!  Poor guy.  When he sees us carry stunt gel (for fire burns) onto the stage - he flees in terror.  What next?  <BR>
I know... "Harm could you bring me that robe from the closet?"<BR>
Harmony opens the wrong door and sunlight bursts in onto Spike's bed!  Flames suddenly erupt from his naked private parts - <BR>
<BR>
Spike: "Damn it!"<BR>

Then a crow flies in and grabs... well you get the idea.<BR>

<DD>Oh artemis!!!  You are the third person who has said that to me now.<BR>
<BR>
Gloria O'Brien is the stunt double who did Sunday's action for her.  Kate Towne is really really thin.  (To quote Sophia)  Kate makes Sarah look fat.  Gloria is a gymnast and has those gymnast muscles.  Kate would snap her arm if she tried to open a bag of salted nuts, much less a completely full can of the aforementioned whup-ass.<BR>
<BR>
Man ... indeed!  You should see her in a bikini.  She's the girlfriend of Wesley Snipes stunt double (who btw is in the dock fight with Trick's gang vs. Faith)  She looks great.  That's no man, baby - yeah!

<DD>I can answer the question about why Trick took on two Slayers unarmed.  Answer:  He didn't.<BR>
<BR>
He was watching from a safe distance with his gang.  He saw a chance to hurt them when they walked under the crane.  He dropped the crate and Buffy happened to be the one who got hit.  Could have been either one or neither one.  <BR>
<BR>
The director didn't want to show Trick up there watching from the crane because he wanted it to be a surprise when it dropped.  He figured that everyone would easily understand that Trick was just using the opportunity he saw to his advantage.<BR>
<BR>
Trick only faced off with an injured Buffy.  Much to his delight.  While his gang took on Faith.  This is all in keeping with his character.  He thought he had it made and was going to get some Slayer blood.  I guess he underestimated Faith a bit.<BR>
<BR>
Being anorexic must have affected the dudes mind.  Poor guy.  Hope he doesn't end up on the cover of PEOPLE.

<BR>
Still --- glad you liked one of the fight scenes.<BR>
<BR>
Angel stunt double Mike Massa and I came up with a much better ending for that ANGEL ep.  At least we think so.  Mike thought that it made better sense if Angel looked at the ring and spoke to Doyle ---<BR>
<BR>
Angel<BR>
At last.  I can walk in the day. Spike will never be able to stop me.  I can really help people now.  <BR>
<BR>
Then, without warning, a crow  zips down and snatches the ring from his hand.  It flys off into the sunset.<BR>

Well... we thought it could work.
