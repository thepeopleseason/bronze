<DD>No surpises - I am in bed.  And sound asleep.  This is merely an astral projection speaking through virtual space.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your congrats.  But they belong solely to the geniuses I'm lucky enough to work for.

<DD><b>Cashmere:</b>  Ack...well, let's hope I have better luck!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Mia:</b>  Thanks!  Sorry you missed it, but it will repeat eventually, plus we're going to put up some clips from the show on our website.  =)<BR>
<b>VaBuffyFan:</b>  Have a nice lunch, and I hope you have a wonderful time at the party!<BR>
<b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  Hey!  Well, we played last night (a wacky acoustic-type set with no drums), and we're playing on the 16th and the 17th of June.  The show on the 16th is at the Key Club and is an ALL AGES show.  The one on the 17th is at the NoHo Festival (in N. Hollywood, obviously), and I believe that is also all-ages.  Check out the site for more info!  =)<BR>
<BR>
OK, I have to run.  Gonna be late!  Eek!<BR>

<DD><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Thanks a million!  =)<BR>
<b>VaBuffyFan:</b>  Hi, there...  Yeah, this is a newer machine, so I was nervous.  But so far, it works.  <i>(fingers crossed)</i><BR>
<b>GreenLion:</b>  Eek!  Don't jinx me!  ;-)<BR>
<b>RogerIrrelevant:</b>  Here, have a banana!  (I have a few left over from a pina-colada party I had last week....)  ;-)

<DD>OK, I am so excited, because I seem to have <i>finally</i> figured out how to program my blankey-blank VCR (I taped the X-Files finale while I was at rehearsal, and it <i>worked</i>!), so I can tape the shows tonight!  YAY!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
*ahem*  And how is everyone this morning?  =)
