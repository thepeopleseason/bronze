<DD><b>POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOR "BLOOD MONEY" AND "CHECKPOINT"</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>M.W.</b>: actually, we talked about that -- whether or not Anne would recognize Angel, and we finally came down on the side of "no".  they had a brief exchange in "Lie To Me" three years ago, and to tell you the truth, i have a hard time remembering people i met three days ago.  so, that's why they don't recognize each other.<BR>
<BR>
<b>PIPPISTRELL</b>: you know, i hadn't really noticed if Angel was more in vampface or less in vampface than he's been in the past.  so i don't think it's intentional, or a harbinger of any kind.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Dead Cow Coat</b>: i can neither confirm nor deny that the city Buffy went to in "Anne" was actually L.A.  mostly 'cause i don't know the answer.  Joss has never said.<BR>
<BR>
<b>and this is the very last time i'm going to discuss this</b>: to <b>Narrator</b> and <b>Kristen</b>:  i wasn't implying there was tension between the <i>parties</i> or the <i>party organizers</i> -- i was saying there's been a lot of tension amongst <i>posters</i> over the parties, and i apologize if i wasn't clear enough on that.  the charity ball in "Blood Money" was NOT based on the PBP, or any other fan party, simply because, hey -- <u>it wasn't a fan party</u>.  it was a fundraiser, first and foremost, and my concept of the PBP was that it was a fan party first, while fundraising clocked in at a distant second.  i realize that there are people who'd disagree with that, and that's fine.  America, free speech, blah blah bitty blah, i'm so stuffy, give me a scone.  but when you, <b>Narrator</b>, say that both shows have "mocked" posters, the Bronze, and the PBP, well, i have to take exception to that.  the inclusion of things like Dr. <b>Angleman</b> and a demon species named <b>Polgara</b>, the fact that Joss has gone out of his way to attend fan parties and signings, the fact that writers and actors have actually <i>posted here</i>, all of these are signs that we <small>(and i feel like such a poser saying "we")</small> here at Buffy and Angel look on the posting board affectionately and appreciatively.  there is no "mocking" involved.  the comment about turning "Serena's" character gay was -- i <i>think</i>, considering i didn't write that scene -- a subtle jab at those folks out there displeased with Willow's transformation on "Buffy", no more, no less.  as for people swarming celebrities, that happens at ANY event celebrities attend.  i mean, celebrities get swarmed other places, too -- you've seen the paparazzi photos of Sarah going into the grocery store, for crying out loud.  it's the culture we're mocking, here, not the posters.  and as for the celebrities themselves, they were parodies of the young, 20-something actors that are all the rage now -- not parodies of <i>our own</i> characters.  we'd have to be kinda arrogant and extremely stupid to do that, wouldn't you think?  <small>and while i can confirm the extreme stupidity of my own personal self, you think i'm gonna lay a charge like that against Joss, genius from whence all things Buffy spring?</small>  bottom line:  "Blood Money" had NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING to do with the PBP.  you can infer all you like, but seeing as how i kinda, you know, <i>wrote</i> half of it, i can tell you with unwavering certainty that the parallels are erroneous.  oh, and <b>Kristen</b> -- nice invites, chica!  they were purty!<BR>

<DD>'k.  here to answer a few quick questions, then back to work.<BR>
<BR>
oh, and damn!  i'm so bummed!  i missed Joss last night!  <small>it's so sad that i can still say that.  and mean it.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOR "BLOOD MONEY" AND "CHECKPOINT"</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>Sarah's carl</b>: as far as i know, Boone is, in the immortal <small>[not IMMORTAL]</small> words of Beetlejuice, "dead, dead, deadski."<BR>
<BR>
<b>Meeby</b>: i, too, saw the RISK/Eddie Izzard connection, but i'm pretty sure they had nothing to do with each other.  i didn't write that scene -- although it has one of my now all-time favorite lines in it:  "3/5ths of the world covered in water, the rest covered in ME!"<BR>
<BR>
<b>Angelalex2x2</b>: as far as i know, they weren't Vatican knights.  of course, i could be wrong, since i've never asked Joss, but i do know that he usually avoids the canonical Christian mythology stuff.  the fact that vampires have an aversion to crosses and holy water is simply widespread vampire lore -- and in the Buffyverse, i think it's interpreted to be more an aversion to signs of righteousness that makes the demons go all squishy, rather than an implicit Jesus/Christianity thing.  Joss has talked about it before -- maybe somebody has those posts archived or something. <small>  i'm certainly not helping by blathering like an idiot.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>OzLady</b>: i'm "the rockiest"?  that's so cool!  watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Corvus</b>: thanks!  i love writing for Merl!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Maeve</b>: the fact that you put "Becoming" and "Redefinition" in the same <i>sentence</i> totally makes my day!<BR>
<BR>
<b>DarkLady</b>: *sigh*.  i'd like to think i have a good handle on Gunn's language, but i gotta admit that i didn't write Gunn's scenes in this ep.  daggummit.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Prophet6</b>:  i can tell you right now, i have no earthly idea what Wesley was doing with his leg in that video.  and i don't <i>wanna</i> know.<BR>
<BR>
<b>andyourlittledogtoo</b>: "The Hydrant Oracles"?  i love it!  i've got no clue as to what it means, but i know i love it!<BR>
<BR>
<b>President Blade</b>: good afternoon, <b>Mr. President</b>!  good to see you!  and btw, i got your email, and am in the process of replying.  which basically means, i saved it to my hard drive, and i'll write you back some time in March.  seriously, though, i look forward to seeing you in L.A.  is <b>Dr. Mrs. President Blade</b> coming this year? <small>but more importantly, does that mean i don't get to lasciviously squeeze your bicep?</small>  and yeah -- i've still got my <b>Rakshasa</b> campaign t-shirt, too.  i've never worn it, 'cause i don't want it to fade, but i still have it.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Frodo</b>: *laugh*  no, the "Tak horn" reference in "Redefinition" wasn't a reference to <b>TAK4eva</b>.  it was from "Parting Gifts", where Cordy stabs Barney with the horn of a Tak demon [the demon who died in the sauna], sucking out his life essence or whatever.<BR>

<DD>hey, guys... just ducking in to say a little somethin':<BR>
<BR>
<b>RELATIVELY SMALL SPOILERS FOR "BLOOD MONEY"</b><BR>
<BR>
i've heard lots of talk over the last couple hours as to the possible parallels between the "Robbery Ball" depicted in the episode and the PBP and PBP planning committee.  the irony being, of course, that this is <i><u>the first time</u></i> these parallels even <u><i>occurred</i></u> to me.  while Shawn and i were writing the eppy, that thought didn't even flit across the radar -- the very first time i heard of it was here, on the board. and in case i'm being my usual incoherent self, i'll state it clearly:  the charity ball was in no way, shape, or form influenced by the PBP or the PBP committee.  i have much love and respect for what these folks do every year -- <i>completely voluntarily</i>, i might add;  no one's payin' 'em.  the thought that i was in some way secreting some "hidden" message is fanciful at best.   <BR>
<BR>
now, i realize there's been a lot of tension over the conflicting/competing/conwhatevering parties this year, and that saddens me greatly. but to infer that we, as writers, are using and/or capitalizing on this tension is, quite frankly, a little off-putting.  bordering on insulting.  Joss would never, never, <u>never</u> sanction something like that, and i hope you all, regardless of your personal feelings re: the PBP, know this to be true.  <BR>
<BR>
while i don't want to influence anybody one way or another, i would like to put out a general call for a cease-fire, if you will.  it may not do any good, but the truth of the matter is, intraboard politics (now and in the past) are frightfully ugly, and completely unnecessary.  we all love the shows (with the exception of the rabid few of you who get p*ssed when Angel has a shirt on -- *wink*), and should be finding common ground on which to discuss the show, not sow discontent and animosity.  i realize it's probably not my place to say these things -- i don't get to post as much as i'd like to anymore <small>(mostly 'cause i'm constantly worried i'm gonna slip and spoil something big)</small>, so i can't really call myself a full-fledged Bronzer -- but i can tell you that seeing an episode i wrote linked with any kind of derogatory and incendiary false statements of intent makes me a little crazy.  and not in that "WHEE! loopy loopy loo!" fun sense of the word.  <BR>
<BR>
be kind to each other.  share ideas.  argue over the BBS's deadness <small>(foolishly, since we know he's a goner! *snerk*)</small>. construct elaborate theoretical speculations. fawn over J. August Richards (my own personal favorite topic). write essays on the symbolism of the stake.  post links, announce births, even run down the latest GH happenings.  but don't fight, y'all.  be kind. and if you can't love each other, at least tolerate each other.  okay?<BR>
