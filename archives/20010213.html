<DD>BTW, that wasn't sarcastic.  Jane and Doug really ARE giants.  Jane, alone, stands well over seven and a half feet.  While Doug's a little over nine.  <BR>
<BR>
I just know they're gonna eat me one of these days.

<DD>Last post, I think...<BR>
<BR>
nessie - sorry, if you think I'm insulting to the fans.  In the future, I'll refrain from posting to those more sensitive.<BR>
<BR>
M - If what you're saying is I'm a HACK, I couldn't agree more.  Very astute observation. <BR>
<BR>
To those who've said nice things, and to those who've expressed their opinions calmly and with humor, this fraud and hack (who forever lives in the shadows of the giants Jane and Doug) thanks you very much.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
~mere's A-dotes~<BR>
<BR>
(Think about it...) <BR>

(Yeah, it sucks.  Okay...)<BR>
<BR>
~MERE'S McCHEESES~<BR>
<BR>
(No, not sure what it means either...)<BR>
<BR>
Okay, Joss would like this one...<BR>
<BR>
Smith's Agents<BR>
<BR>
(See, it's like Agent Smith from THE MATRIX, but it's Smith's Agents and...)<BR>
<BR>
Okay, I'll keep thinking.

<DD>Okay!  Okay, you've convinced me.  I was wrong!!!  Wrong, do you hear?!!  I now DO think a genuine relationship - a love story - could evolve, and redemption could be achieved, if Dawn started dating one of the Gentlemen.<BR>
<BR>
Again, I'm sorry I didn't see it before.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>*sigh*<BR>
<BR>
Once again my attempt at a humorous response to others' contrary opinions has led to much bashing of me.  To those of you who appreciate my quirky, sardonic postings, I say "distance yourself from me, before they hang us all."<BR>
<BR>
For the official record, there is no "tension" among the writers (except for the sexual kind I feel for Doug Petrie).  And whoever made this point is correct... These are Joss' characters, to do with as he wishes.  And what he does with them, even when I don't initially see it, turns out to be uniformly brilliant.  <BR>
<BR>
I am all for Spike's crush on Buffy.  I am all an ever changing and growing relationship between he and Buffy, as well as the other characters.<BR>
<BR>
As far as the S/B thing, I've stated my opinion.  I can make a further case, but why bother furthering the debate since so many of you take this way too personally.  (Except for you guys that don't.)<BR>
<BR>
And, by the way, those of you who felt insulted by my equating them with Richard Ramirez's penpals ("Oh my god - he did it again!  Did you see that!?"), I'll say "sorry."  Really.<BR>
<BR>
But you may want to consider the possibility that you guys take some things a leeetle too seriously.  ("Did you see that?  Now he's saying we have no sense of humor!  Damn you, Fury.")<BR>
<BR>
Anyhoo, the upshot is, don't hate me for my views, or my attempts of benign sarcasm... Hate me because I'm beautiful.

<DD>color codes be damned... (I've forgotten them yet again)<BR>
<BR>
Okay, I see comments I've made in an interview have once again sparked some controversy.  Let me stress these are my personal opnions and do not necessarily reflect those of management (and they cannot be reprinted without the expressed written consent of Major League baseball.)  Now...<BR>
<BR>
To those who feel my conviction that Spike can never be redeemed and cannot someday end up with our heroine, shows a lack of imagination of my part, I say you're right.  It is beyond my limited imagination to see a strong, independant, female character end up falling for a murderer who would be killling innocent people were he not suffering from chip affliction.  <BR>
<BR>
I regret I don't have the creative mind that, say, Thomas Harris has when he saw fit to sell out the character of Clarice Starling by having her become lovers with a cannibalistic psychopath, charming and brilliant as he may be.<BR>
<BR>
That's just one of my many weaknesses as a writer.  <BR>
<BR>
For those of you who fault my thinking, I can only say I'll try to be more openminded in the future.  <BR>
<BR>
In the meanwhile, S/B shippers, you can go back to writing your penpals, Richard Ramirez and the Hillside Strangler, and I hope they finally accept your marriage proposals.<BR>
<BR>
Your simple-minded pal,<BR>
David Fury<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
P.S. Tell Allyson I am her Big Daddy.<BR>
<BR>
Hope most of you like tonight's ep.
