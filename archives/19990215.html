<DD>It was grrreat to meet some of you guys at the PBP.  I saw some more of you at Disneyland the next day!  Lil Willow, it was supah to meet you in person.  And I'm really appreciative of all the warmth and compliments everyone so lavishly handed out.  How about that open bar, huh?  The only thing missing was collaborator guy.
