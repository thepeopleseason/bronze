<DD>ShadowSlayer -- yep.  I really did.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Thumper -- thanks.  I'm actually writing the monthly angel comic that starts next month.<BR>
<BR>
Haven -- Yeah, Charisma Carpenter read the Immortal audio!  Cool.<BR>

<DD>Lab -- I'm NEVER wrong.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Carita & Horizon -- hey.  I loved both premieres, actually.  I had read the scripts, and I thought both shows were better on film than on paper (and I liked 'em on paper).  I did think that Xander was maybe a little TOO serious.<BR>
<BR>
Oh,and a general note . . . there's some stuff in the spoilers here that is a long, long way off in the season.  If you don't want to know, DON'T read 'em.  (Of course, some are wrong).  All I can say is, if I didn't already know, I'd hate to find out.  By the time I went to see the Sixth Sense (last week), I knew NOTHING about the movie.  Ah, will power.  (It's rare for me, so I gotta brag on it.)  : )</SMALL>
