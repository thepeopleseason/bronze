<DD>biobabe: Keep me posted.  I'd love to take a look.  You can e me through Tiggy or Boo, if you're real sweet to 'em.  And yeah, PBP.  Cool chillin' with the scientist.  Absolutely, doc.<BR>
<BR>
Taliesin:  What's this I hear about you and caramels?  Put those down immediately!  Or better yet, hand them over and I'll dispose of them myself.  Mmmmm... caramelly!<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  How hard do you ROCK?!  I just took a peek at the ad online and WOW!  That is so utterly cool.  We really do have the best fans in the world.  I'm sure Joss was deeply touched.  I know I was.<BR>
<BR>
DowntownApartments:  Not sure which version Drew worked on.  Be sure to ask him when he pops up.<BR>
<BR>
kronos:  I'm such a cad.  How can I ever make it up to you?  A refreshing malt perhaps? ;)<BR>
<BR>
slayerdaddy:  Shut your mouth!<BR>
<BR>
Risa:  Discount furniture?  Oh!  Where were you two hours ago before Ethan Allen got their insidious hooks into me?<BR>
<BR>
Cashmere:  Always a pleasure to get the ladies worked up. :o<BR>
<BR>
Okay, gotta fly and be free.  As always, huge thanks to Boo and Tiggy for their DeKnight related sites.  You guys extra rock!  <BR>
<BR>
Hugs and Pokes for everyone!  No, I said everyone!  Get over here!<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>Cashmere:  Okay, now you're spooking me.  I was in fact at Ikea this morning. Call your spies off, damn you!<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  You know, this is the first "real" furniture I've ever bought, being of the paycheck-to-paycheck until just recently.  Heck, I'm still sleeping on a futon I bought when I was in college back in 1990 (the new bed doesn't arrive until the end of July).  <BR>
<BR>
biobabe: What is this film you speak of and how fast can you send me a copy?  And I promise if you show up to the PBP, they'll be extra chillin' going on.<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  From what I've heard, Sarah has a great voice.  And let me tell you, the musical is going to blow you away.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  Yeah, Drew posted last Friday when I was on.  And that's all you're getting out of me, baby!<BR>
<BR>
@lex H:  You'll get nothing and like it!  I said like it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha -cough, hack -ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!<BR>
<BR>
wolfguard: West was moaning about not getting screenwriting credit on Tomb Raider.  He basically said that he didn't know what the big deal was with writing.  According to him, it's just throwing a bunch of ideas down on paper.  Gee, you think it shows in his films?  <BR>
<BR>
Tiggy:  You see, you're starting a chain reaction by even saying you might not go to the PBP.  Don't tempt dem crazy fates, mama!<BR>
Okay, last round then I gotta freebird.

<DD>paksenarrion:  Drew recently worked on Queer as Folk.  Hope that helps jog something loose!<BR>
<BR>
BuffyBuff:  No, I haven't seen the ad yet.  I'll dig it up when I get to the office tomorrow.  Thanks to everyone who contributed and put it together.  You guys are great!<BR>
<BR>
Andrea:  It rocks beyond belief.  My best work is blue.<BR>
<BR>
BiteMeGirl:  Spike does have the chip removed next season, but the op goes horrible awry and turns him into a song and dance vamp.  "Strangers in the night, two teeth biting..."<BR>
<BR>
Narrator:  Nope, no missing Buffy hand at the end of The Gift.  Although if you replay the scene frame by frame, you'll see something interesting over there in the grassy knoll.<BR>
<BR>
Red Crayon:  Beats me.  Give Minear a kick the next time he pops in and see if he knows.<BR>
<BR>
Slayerdaddy:  It's all about the Isaac Hayes, my friend.  Sweeeeeeet Buttered Soul!

<DD>Tiggy:  Got the e, wild woman.  Sounds like you had a sweet b-day.  Glad to hear about the cash going into the PBP fund.  If you don't come, I'm staying home!<BR>
<BR>
DowntownApartments: Mow my own lawn?  And expose my delicate milky skin to the unforgiving sun?  Pish and tush, I say,  pish and tush.  Haven't seen Tomb Raider.  I'm boycotting because of Simon West's asinine comments about writing in his LA Times interview.  Jerk.  No wonder he's never directed a decent movie.<BR>
<BR>
dante:  Dracula in season 6? Grrrrr!  Arghhhh!<BR>
<BR>
Kiba Rika:  Removal accepted.  We didn't actually celebrate Joss' birthday.  He's out of town.  We'll dogpile him for some birthday spankin' when he gets back.<BR>
<BR>
Christopher Marlowe:  The Pad O' Love is more retro fifties.  Deep brown leathers and brushed steel accessories.  Can you dig it?  As for ep. 5, not broken yet, but the Big Man has approved the general story.<BR>
<BR>
genrefan:  Season six starts filming around mid July.<BR>
<BR>
biobabe: With you as a member of DeKnight's Riders, I can happily expire now.  Read earlier that you're a scientist as well as aspiring actress.  Sweet mother!  Could you be any cooler?<BR>
<BR>
white wings:  More furniture purchased.  More money sucked out of my monkey butt (but at least it'll have a place to sit).<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  Received the e.  Thanks!  And can I just say, "Grrrrrrr!"  (that being the good kind of growl)

<DD>Adri:  I'm roasting, but otherwise life be good.<BR>
<BR>
Paradox:  Season 6 is shaping up to be one of the best yet.  And that's not just a bunch of insider hype.  As a fan of the show, I'm thrilled where Joss is taking it.<BR>
<BR>
New writers?  Why, glad you asked!  Yes, the rumors are true.  A fine young mango by the name of Drew Greenberg has joined our weevil little tribe.  Great guy, heaps of talent.  Show him the extra fancy love when he stops by the Bronze.

<DD>Vlad: Thanks!  It's always nice to be identified as the next step in human evolution.  Which, come to think of it, explains my huge pulsating dome.

Must.. remove... pants...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ah!  Much better!<BR>

Cashmere:  Happy anniverisary!

<DD>Honk honk!  Just a drive by to let you know I haven't forgotten about you beautiful Bronzers.  Off to look for some wicked furniture to accent my new pad o' love.  I'll be back for a longer stay around 2 or 3.  Kick off those constricting pants and stay a spell.
