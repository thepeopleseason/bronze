<DD> We should do an episode about the board as an evil, time-sucking place.  I've been on here for half-an-hour! --- make that an hour.

<DD> Sorry.  That was cruel.  I know that irony doesn't travel well in print.  The Shannen (sp?) thing is just a fiction.  I don't know how it got started.  But I do know that she and Sarah are friends...  So stranger things could happen, I suppose.

<DD>The movie is actually a romantic comedy type thing (no monsters!) for Universal.  And I am, last time I checked, not a bloke.  I just play one on TV.  It's kinda cool that people can't tell from the writing itself.  I always think of my stuff as real girly.  Congrats to the cosmic parents.

<DD>We have already started working on next season - in fact, I just wrote "the end" on Ep. One. (although many revisions await me I'm sure...)  I'm celebrating by taking a little spin around the bronze.  All I can tell you about next season is that IT ROCKS!!  And that Shannon Doherty is going to be awsome.

<DD>  Soooo jealous that I couldn't get to London.  I had to stay home and work on a movie (that is past due, actually.)  Not that I was invited to London.  That's the bummer.  Most writers aren't asked to those things.  Joss, being a God, is the exception.  In any case, I am not complaining.  I got to write and get paid for it - which is a dream come true.  <BR>
<BR>
Work is still fun, always fun.  Even when it's hard - it's the best kind of hard there is.  (Well, maybe not the best.  But a close second.)

<DD>Hey.  I'm just lurking around.  Haven't been on the board in a dog's age.  (and what is a "dog's age" anyway?  Doesn't that depend on the dog?)

<DD>Would love to stay and stir the pot, but I gotta run for a brain meet on ep. 5.  Two things before I go:<BR>
<BR>
Red Crayon:  Boxers today are little pink pigs with fancy top hats, in honor of Tiggy's B-day.<BR>
<BR>
Tiggy:  You totally rock, gorgeous.  I expect a full email account of your wonderful birthday.  Have a great one.<BR>
<BR>
And with that, my brain is off to cause mayhem and mischief.  Bad brain, bad!<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*
