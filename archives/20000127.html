Hi Christa.<BR>
<BR>
Gotta run.  Hope everyone enjoys Angle Man's on-camera dancing cameo (how did he get into that dress) in ep 13.

FYG - sounds fun, I have no idea who you are though.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Hi greengirl, Hollyn<BR>
<BR>
Thoin - well, actually, for the most part the music in comedic eps takes itself quite seriously (e.g. the monster music when Giles first wakes up and sees himself in the mirror).  But to answer your question... if it's a good ep (and they're all at least that) I get into it regardless of its tone.  But the great ones that really challenge me (Hush) are the ones I really throw myself into.<BR>
<BR>
KAM - well, then time off for me = bad for you.  Don't care though.<BR>
<BR>
Quiet in here no?

Angle Man - yeah, but did you know you're not the only one?  Someone else from the board too.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Lilbufbuf, banana (I happen to like Riley), cec, gazoo, Mr. Grenz.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin - the music on Angel was composed by Robert Kral, as are most-to-all the episodes these days.
