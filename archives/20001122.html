<DD>  Last post for now...my Dad just got home from work, and I must say hello and have dinner.  (I feel 17 again!  hehehe)<BR>
<b>TMorel:</b>  HEY!!  Nice to see you!  Sorry I've been absent...I've been under mucho stress.  But I'm coming out of it, I swear!  =)  You're very welcome for the stuff, and the gig was so much fun!  It ran very late, partly due to evil technical gremlins and partly due to a surprise performance by Mr. James Marsters, but it was a cool evening!  As for a UK tour for VC...let's all just pray it's soon, OK?  I wanna come over!  =)<BR>
<b>DeAn:</b>  Hello, there!  We'll definitely try and plan a gig for the PBP weekend.  (When is it, anyway???)<BR>
RSO's to <b>Dunlin</b> and <b>Lady of the Lake!</b><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OK, my parents are actually calling my name to come to the table!  LOL  See you guys later!<BR>

<DD><b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  Hey, there!  Thanks for coming to the show the other night...regardless of the gremlins that plagued us, I had a good time!  Hope you did, too.  =)  (And don't forget about December 3rd!  New CD!  intimate, lounge-y show!  Yay!)<BR>
<b>IamMe:</b>  Hello, there.  My holiday is going well, thanks.  And yours?<BR>
<b>Tauri:</b>  Hehehe...no worries.  And on behalf of us US types, thank you!

<DD>Hello, everybody, and Happy Thanksgiving in advance to all U.S. residents!  ;-)  I'm currently in NJ, visiting the parents.  Thought I'd stop by to say hi...so, HI!
