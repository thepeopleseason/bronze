<dd>Angel 101: You've heard "Empty Places" is an excellent episode?  Who are your sources?  Did I pay them enough?  Obviously, yes, yes I did.<br><br>Dachelle: You delicious vixen.  You haven't been added to my club yet?  Paks is STILL withholding, and not just from me now???  We have to find out what's upsetting Paks.<br><br>CarpeDi: Oh, you know, I look better without the head.<br><br>Guys, Mama Greenberg is calling, apparently, Mr. Personality has started... I gotta poof, but I miss you all, I'll try to jump back on soon to say hello.<br><br>

<dd>Y Slay: Happy?  I'm kind of awed and humbled and agog, actually.  I STILL don't believe they let me in.  I know, most of you probably can't believe they let me in, either.<br><br>Ouro and EverDawn: I have a really good sense of smell.  Or, wait, no... I just smell really good.  One of those things.  Anyway, you can't hide the pie is what I meant.<br><br>Bawston: Forget you?  Of course not.  Never.  I might forget Rebecca, which is why I've sewn her little picture inside my jacket lining.  Don't tell her, she'll freak out.<br><br>Chuck Waldo: I do have something in the works for Life AB (After Buffy), but I gotta stay quiet for now.  Anyone who wants to cross fingers or whatever... please do so now.<br><br>Kaymyth: HA!  Made you cry!  You guys are so easy...<br><br>

<dd>Wolfguard: Hey back!!<br><br>Carpe: I KNOW.  And poor Paul.  Poor, clueless, about-to-be-recast Paul.  <br><br>Dogtrot: I think some people are gonna cry, some people are gonna cheer.  Some people are gonna be pissed, but I think those are the ones who woke up on the wrong side of the bed and should just take a deep breath and relax anyway.  Some people are gonna be giddy, but there might be controlled substances involved.  I'll tell ya what... I never cry.  Ever.  It's a thing, goes back to my childhood and an incident in second grade, I'll tell you guys about it some time, but for right now?  I never cry.  And when Joss handed us the outline?  I cried.  Cried like Steve DeKnight finding out they cancelled Knight Rider.  Just from the outline.  Just saying.<br><br>

<dd>Hey, Jenna!  No, sadly, I won't be able to attend the AICN party.  I'll be out of town for the finale, which bums me out, mostly `cause I wanna see how funny Herc is.  I hear he's really, really funny.  So funny.  But it sounds like fun, are you going?<br><br>Chris M.: Pic?  Of us?  Paks?  Are you withholding love from me?  I'm shocked, shocked, I tell you... only one way to settle this.  Someone's gonna hafta arm wrestle.<br><br>Y Slay: Heya!  Just, you know... hangin' out... running away from LA for a bit after watchin' a beloved show end a seven-year run, that kinda thing.  Went to see the ol' hometown so I can cry my eyes out in peace, you know...!<br><br>
