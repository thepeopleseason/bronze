<DD>Sorry about that.  I got sucked into some Buffy fan mag stuff.  They're doing a spread on me and Rebecca Kirshner next month.  I keep trying to talk them into letting me do a nude spread. Maybe a letter writing campaign?<BR>
<BR>
I'm on my way out, but I'll try to answer a few more questions before I split.  Let's see what I remember...<BR>
<BR>
What do our crack visual effects team make?  Beats me. But hey, aren't they great?<BR>
<BR>
How did I get started in writing?  Wanted to be an actor.  Too short.  Became a writer.  Now I'm ten feet tall!  Arghhhh!  Steve smash!<BR>
<BR>
Watchmen rules.  Also love Powers.  And The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen more than lives up to its title.<BR>
<BR>
Is Xander going to die?  Hmmmm.  Well he is looking a little pale.  Oh wait, that's me.  We look so much alike.  Oh wait, that's his twin brother.  I don't look anything like him.<BR>
<BR>
That's all I got.  Hugs and pokes for the lot of you.  For those of you who haven't already, harass Boo and sign up for DeKnight's Riders.  Get the membership up to 300 and I promise to post an embarassing topless photo.  You'll laugh till your heart gives out.

<DD>Sorry about the unannounced poof.  Had to throw my pants on and grab some lunch.  Whoops!  I slipped into Fury's pants by mistake!<BR>
<BR>
Let's see if I can answer some of the questions I've scrolled here.<BR>
<BR>
Episode #20 is my last for this season (we only do 22).  Hopefully I'll be back next year to do a full spread (this year I was only around for a freelance and then an 11-week run here at the end).<BR>
<BR>
Caught that line on Dawson's Creek.  Loved it.  Don't know if they were talking about us, though.  90210 pulled pretty much the same bit.  Although Joss made it clear that Willow was opting not to go to a world class college and instead attend at Sunnydale to stay close to the gang.<BR>
<BR>
Most of us here are rabid comic book fans.  For those of you who don't read them, do yourself a favor and pick up The Dark Knight Returns or Neil Gaiman's Sandman series.  Great stuff you can find in your local book store.<BR>
<BR>
Amber rocks!  Can't wait to see her film.

<DD>Manx: Nice try, crackerjack. Luckily my Black Ops NSA training saved me from your veiled attempt at mind control. Although I am seized by the sudden desire to fly to Toronto... <BR>
<BR>
Amberlynne: Not sure if Angel or Xander are going to disrobe.  But I'm not wearing any pants, if that helps.

<DD>Isis: Hello and welcome.  Don't let your newness freak you out.  I'm freshly minted here too.<BR>
<BR>
random: Thanks for jumping into that conversation.  Saved me from having to whip out the whole Dark Knight Returns bit.  Poor government dupe Supes.  Never stood a chance.<BR>
<BR>
Mia: Schedule permitting, I'm actually planning on stopping in the Succubus studio the day after my next episode airs (#20 - sometime in May, I think).  I'll bring my special radio voice. <BR>
<BR>
Robyn:  Hello to you.  What school are you breaking free from?<BR>
<BR>

<DD>kiba rika:  Sweet.  Nothing warms up your head like a Joss is a Hottie hat.<BR>
<BR>
jono: I'll try to stop by when I get the chance.<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness: Hi right back at ya.

<DD>nails: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Thanks!  Now I've seen photographic proof that I'll never drink again.<BR>
<BR>
artemis: "Schmuck bait" is a term, I believe, used when we roll out a classic horror gonna get'cha moment.  Usually used when a trap is about to be sprung by the Big Nasties.  Our hero is the Schmuck, the trap is the bait, hence "Schmuck Bait."  On the other hand, it might also be Rebecca Kirshner's nickname for me.<BR>
<BR>
kiba rika:  Thanks for the kind words.  I would love a Joss is a Hottie hat.  Send one on over -- I'll wear it proudly the next time I slink into his office for script notes.

<DD>Any of you wonderful folks have the link to the Red Hood pic of me kissing the monkey?  Still haven't had the chance to see it.  Thanks!
