<DD>Last post...<BR>
<BR>
Hi and Bye to <b>Bruce's Mom!</b><BR>
<b>Mabb:</b>  Thanks a milion!  So glad you like it...<BR>
<b>DeMoriel:</b>  It went great, actually.  The power went out, so Brian (our gutar player) and I took matters into our own hands and played completely acoustic, sitting on the edge of the stage.  No mic, no power, just me and a guitar...it was cool, and we probably couldn't have planned it better!<BR>
<BR>
Bye, everybody!  Don't forget, if you live in the L.A. area, we will be playing an <b>18 and over</b> show at the <b>Key Club on March 19th.</b>  To get FREE TICKETS, just e-mail Jeff@velvetchain.com with your address and how many you'd like.  (up to 6)  Under 18 can get in if you have dinner there (you need reservations) and have at least one 18 year old in your group.<BR>
<BR>
If you'd like to order <b>"The Buffy E.P."</b> go to http://www.Apollointeractive.com and click on our text link.  First page.<BR>
<BR>
Bye-bye!<BR>
<BR>
Erika

Nope, that was K's Choice I believe.  A band I've actually heard of...not a little old on-the-fringes alternative band, like us.  =)  (Also, if you go to our site, you'll see I am very thin, have stick-straight black hair, nad basically look nothing like the lovely lady in last night's ep.)  They're good, though, don'tcha think?<BR>
