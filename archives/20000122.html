<DD>Anyhow ---<BR>
Some of my stuntguys called and they are getting together with me tonight at one of their parent's Chinese Restaurant.  So I'm gonna take off and go meet them.  Hope I was able to see and answer everyone who wanted to ask me a question.<BR>
<BR>
Buffyfans are the best and I enjoyed talking to you all.<BR>

<SMALL>(Sat Jan 22 18:24:53 2000 169.132.153.19)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>WillowWannabe - I used a ladder rack to drop them from the ceiling of the stage in front of a back drop made of bits of the old set that we had shot the fight in a week earlier.<BR>
<BR>
Kane - I came back fro working overseas to find that Joss was in need of a stunt coordinator who could do the st<i></i>yle he wanted.  At first he didn't want to meet me because I'd done Power Rangers and he didn't want to be associated with that show.  I finally got to meet him and show him a different way of doing the fights from what they had been doing.  After our first couple of fights together he turned to David Greenwalt and said, "We should have had him all along."  That made me feel great.  But lately I hardly get to see him and staying on the Joss course is a bit harder.  people try to play with his creation when he is not around and do the things that I know he'll hate later when he sees it.  I just keep trying.<BR>
<BR>
It's tough sometimes being stuck in the middle of many huge egos all pulling sneaky manuevers for their own reasons.  That's Hollywood though.  I've just tried to stay true to his vision and that's all I can do.  At least I can hold my head up because I know I've done what he asked me to do. The results don't lie.  Wherever BUFFY debuts the pattern is the same.  A lot of people laugh at this girl trying to fight vamps, but a few critics praise the writing attempt anyway.  Then in second season the popularity picks up and fans start talking about what a "kick ass chick" this Buffy girl is.<BR>
<BR>
First season BUFFY was rated 104 out of 107 shows.  That's horrible.  Now it's a huge hit.  And no one talks about Buffy without mentioning the great fights this character does.  So at least I know I never once let Joss down.  No matter what.  I'm proud of that.

<DD>Vox - Making a good script Great by Linda Segar is a nice one too.  Lots of practical info.<BR>
<BR>
Destiny - Did I mention that after Buffy landed on him she rode him all the way to the top yelling, "Go pony, go!"<BR>
<BR>

<DD>LadyW - Don't despair.  A couple of people that I originally met at the Bronze do now work at the ANGEL office downstairs.  I don't know how often they post.  One is a secret.  One is out in the open about it.  Both are super cool people who love the shows.  Just like you and me.  I don't think anyone has sold a script yet, but who knows?  Anything can and will happen.<BR>
<BR>
AngelLover24-7 - Chris O'Hara always loves to do crazy falls.  I just rarely have a chance to use his skill because we have no sets from which to fall during a fight.  Once I bet him that he couldn't turn over a certain number of spins (after being kicked in the face by Sophia) before hitting some crates and then the concrete below.  He did it.  It's in the episode with the big blob guy.  Kinda outrageous.

<DD>Mesuvius - Mha-ha!  I saw that same comment on the newsgroup.  They told me only to shoot them falling and NOT Buffy actually catching up to the demon.  For one thing it's a mystery.  For another there would be no time to shoot it.  I was lucky just to have a shot of them falling.  I guess the demon hit a rock on the way and Buffy landed on him, broke his neck, and held on while Riley "the fisher of men" pulled with his Commando Power.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Pointy - They haven't started shooting yet and I had originally turned them down before Christmas , so I don't know if the job is still open right now.  It does contain a beautiful babe.  It just doesn't have Martial arts in it.

<SMALL>(Sat Jan 22 17:37:14 2000 169.132.153.19)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Destiny - I like to use the room and things in fights.  But so often it's a matter of being told that we can't touch that chair, can't dent that wall, can't put your foot on that cloth, etc ... Sometimes American tv reminds me of a fashion show.  That's why the Hong Kong guys go so nuts when they first arrive and try to work under these conditions.  They are shocked by all this stuff.  We have to remember sometimes that we are here to put on a show to ENTERTAIN people.  That's the goal.  Everything else is secondary.  No entertainment value. Soon no more show.<BR>
<BR>
Malista - Sophia hates heights too.  She had to hang for many hours in the harness that day.<BR>
<BR>
Angleman - I wear all the stuff I get.  Sometimes actors rib me about it, but I don't care.  I am just amazed that anyone would give me anything.  Contrary to what you may think, I'm not really a cute blonde freshman girl.  So me getting gifts is shocking.

<DD>Stephanie - I once dropped from a helicopter as an explosion went off on the deck of a battle ship.  I had to crash through the hull of the ship and hit an air bag.  By the time I hit the bag it and and the rest of the ship was already on fire.  It was so huge that it was hard to believe that I was a real person going through all of that mess.  That one was fairly dangerous.

I'm hoping that I might get to meet some of you at the PBP if possible.  Or maybe some other event like that.  I like to meet the folks behind the names.  A couple of the Bronzers now work at Buffy too (which is pretty cool if you ask me)

<DD>X-Lander - There's a Beozoar in my pants right now actually.<BR>
<BR>
newfan - Not the stunt part (Harmony jumps in hole was Sophia and Xander thrown into post was Mark Wagner)  But the slow-mo fight could not have been anyone other than the hilarious stylings of Mr. Nick himself.  He has the art of making me laugh down perfect.  I almost shot soda out my nose.<BR>
<BR>
Vox - You are right about that.  I just try as hard as I can to answer as many people as possible (Thus my screwly typing mistakes)<BR>
So ... here's a question for everyone --<BR>
<BR>
Whatis your personal fave fight on BUFFY ?(for my own choreography notes for the future)</SMALL>

<SMALL>(Sat Jan 22 17:05:24 2000 169.132.153.19)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Mr. Pointy - I've known one of the main producers of XENA for many years now.  When he started the show he sent tape sof my work down there for them to copy.  Now he's asking me to come aboard another show of his.  Only I wouldn't get to do any Martial arts action.  Just direct like a normal human.  Could be boring, but the money's good.<BR>
<BR>
Destiny - I started in Korean and Japanese st<i></i>yles and then stared mixing and matching through the years (much as Bruce Lee did)  I use a movie version of everything that works for the screen in what I do now.  I concentrate only on the stunt fighting side of things now.<BR>
<BR>
Sophia came into the Hong Kong film world as a model and actress in Asia.  She trained with the Jackie Chan team and Yukari Oshima's team for many years as she made those movies.  If you ever see any of Yukari's films you may see her fight with Sophia or at least notice how much Yukari moves like Sophia/Buffy.

<DD>Vox - That's certainly true.  Joss does come up with certain character traits that we have to keep in mind.  We were all happy to have my friend stuntman Lee Whitaker come in to double Seth in and out of Werewolf costume.  He and Seth used to get into long discussions on animal movements and Lee even went to the Zoo to study before we put him in the suit.  They really have it down now.

<DD>Arcadia - It's a mix.  Look close and you'll see Steve's face as he spins and hits the demon.  I rigged a double wire technique to aid James in lifting and throwing the demon into the Hellmouth.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin - Sophia is in the other room right now getting a message from her last two days of slamming.  She's just trying to think of non-Buffy thoughts at the moment.<BR>
<BR>
Vox - With total freedom I usually design things into the set that are built especially  for stunts.  Much as they used to do for Jackie Chan in Hong Kong.  I like to make various stunts and fall reactions possible by creating a set for that.<BR>
<BR>
And it's true that you rarely see blood and things either.  There is a limit to what we can show and we have to be careful about it.<BR>
<BR>
Slave - I and the entire crew love every moment that Eliza is with us.  I wish she were always there.  It's like a breath of fresh air.  Please put me in her club.  Thanks.

<DD>Mr. Pointy - (hopefully you'll see this)  Karen Sheperd does Eliza's fighting.  If you ever get a chance to rent a tape of a movie called MISSION OF JUSTICE (Republic Pictures 1992)  In it Karen plays a cop and I stunt coordinate and also play a character named Sal.  That's Karen.  She also played a character on HERCULES called The Enforcer.

<SMALL>(Sat Jan 22 16:37:58 2000 169.132.153.19)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Lady Wolfbane:  Okay here's a response - <BR>
1 - Here is a spoiler about me:  If I leave the show I promise to come on here (and elsewhere) and tell all about my real behind-the-scenes life at BUFFY.  No holds barred.  How about that?  Some may get angry.  Some may laugh.  All will go into shock.  That's all I can say for now.<BR>
<BR>
2 - David loved Matrix (so did Joss and I)  So I'm sure the guys wanted to try some things.  I've done all of that before and Joss has always discouraged it on BUFFY.  He's told me that he doesn't want to get into the "flying people" thing.  He did tell me that he may have to take more control over some of the things at ANGEL to keep it from drifting too far over the top.  But we'll have to see.  I guess it'll all depend on what he thinks the story needs.  If a vamp can jump two stories in a particular script because Joss wants him to - he will.  If we get so violent that the censors decide to protest that'll be up to Joss too.  Whatever st<i></i>yle best fits what he wants in an episode is the only real rule.  We'll see what mood he wants to create in the future.<BR>
<BR>
3 - The Kip-Up<BR>
<BR>
4 - Steve Tartalia a white Hong Kong stuntman is the double for Spike most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
5 - It's happening all around us.  Pretty cool.<BR>
<BR>
6 - I'll miss the scripts most of all when I leave the show.  They really keep me going.

<DD>Kenicki - I don't do ANGEL.  But you are right in that more time and money is spent over there.  Often a second unit is able to get all the cool angles on stunts a day before the main unit arrives.  They get a paid rehearsal day.  We get a half hour before we shoot.  They get all the equipment they can use.  We are told NOT to use equipment very often (or even stop the fight to set up a stunt) becdause main unit is too far behind by the time they get to the fights and they need to shoot everything in a simplified way.  That means doing all the fights from beginning to the end.  Non-stop.  Then getting a few actor shots in before moving on to more acting scenes.  No time.  No time.  That's it.<BR>
<BR>
I miss working with a small action unit and shooting all the good stuff.  Being held back is hard to take.  I do miss the stunts I used to be able to set up.

<SMALL>(Sat Jan 22 16:14:25 2000 169.132.153.19)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Vox - One thing I've noticed among beginner writers is that they try to give too much info.  This even happens on BUFFY on occasion.  It feels weird for a writer to leave so much white.  The truth is all you have to do is hit the major story points and describe the FEELING that is behind the give and take.  Trying to choreograph a fight (as many less experienced writers do) on paper creates things that just don't work in real life and even slow things down.  Usually they are things we've all seen a hundred times, but it feels odd not to have dialogue and descriptions of moves to them.  Joss usually rewrites things and puts BIG FIGHT ENSUES or MUCH FIGHTY.  To me that means do it Joss-st<i></i>yle (i.e. brutally)<BR>
<BR>
On most movies and shows I just talk with the director to find out which  parts of the script he thinks he needs and then I choreograph every move within that framework.  The best fights are the ones where we get freedom (such as ANNE and B2 and the like) The worst ones are when we are forced to try to imitate too much of what's on the page.  Often these instructions are really jibberish and contain moves that don't exist or look horribly stiff.  The smart producers/driectors let the ones who are experts in something make them look good.

<DD>Brazenlee - It's hard to say.  I like most of them.  Some I don't care for at all.  My faves are usually the ones I got to do with Joss.  I like the way he uses camera movement in the fights.  I like the same kind of flow that he does.  I prefer it when he's there.<BR>
<BR>
Kane - PC version yes.<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane - Sorry I missed the question.  Could you ask again?  I have a hard time keeping up sometimes.<BR>
<BR>
Butthanks for all the comments re: the awards thing.  At the moment stunt people are just pawns to be used for union negotiations for the actors.  We don't often get the same kind of representation (although the average stuntman pays more in dues than the average actor ever will)</SMALL>

Angleman:  I already bask in the light of the awesome Fury scripts.  But I'd be happy to follow his club doings.  He and the writers are the most talented working in television today.<BR>

And yeah... I'm sure Joss gets tired too.  Probably much more than me.  I don't know how he can keep doing this.  I really don't know.  It's brutal.

<DD>Ed - We started working on it last weekend.  The characters look awesome.  Just like the actors.<BR>
<BR>
Vox - Mostly we just do a few close ups.  Unless the character doesn't have to be that skilled in Martial arts or something.  I'm rougher on Marc and Nick, but extremely careful with the more fragile actresses.<BR>
<BR>
Karma - Sophia did the sword fight with a broken finger (from blocking the punch of the first vamp)  She's broken fingers and is constantly covered in bruises.  Every weekend she is in the hot tub trying to heal.  She's one never ending injury all season.

<DD>Paris Angel - All smart folks are afraid of high places.  Only morons like me actually enjoy them.  I think Sophia's stomach moved up into her throat when we dropped her (all ten times)<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander - We don't get awards.  Often we are ordered to remain hidden so that the actor and director can take the glory.  So according to the head of the motion picture academy:<BR>
"Stunt work is neither creative or technical.  So how can we give an award?"  The top dogs at the Emmy Awards told a group representing stunt people that: <BR>
"We don't want to appear to condone violence.  We can't give an award for that kind of thing."<BR>
<BR>
On and on it goes.  No wonder we don't get the respect.<BR>
<BR>
Spikey - Steve Tartalia is the Spike stunt double.  He used to work with Jackie Chan in Hong Kong movies.<BR>
<BR>
KA - Sophia has been training since the 80s.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Vox - Yep that was to you.  However I like the word Vox.  Sounds like the name of a stench demon from the Hellmouth.  (Just be glad that you can't smell through the TV.  Rubber suits used over and over again often can become ... how shall I say it?  Voxy?  You know.<BR>
<BR>
The other stuff:<BR>
1)  It helps.  Except for the stunt guys who already have that vamp face.  There are some.<BR>
<BR>
2)  Yes. I choreographed every bit of the sword fight.  Joss and I did talk about maybe NOT making Buffy so good with the sword, but in the end we decided it would be cooler to have her go toe-to-toe with Angelus.

X-Lander - I dunno.  Everyone has different tastes.  I hope that you'll lkie some of the ones coming up.  I just try like crazy to stick to what Joss would want and not allow myself to stray from that no matter what.  I figure that he hired me to work on something that HE created, so I feel obligated to always keep in mind the words, "What would Joss want in this situation?"  That's really all I can do.

<DD>MyYoda - That was Sophia taking that fall as Buffy.  She does ALL of Buffy's stunts from the fights to the falls to being set on fire to being hit by a truck to sliding her Mom's car.  Sophia has done them all.<BR>
<BR>
Faith's fighting is doen by our friend Karen Sheperd.  The high fall into the back of the truck was done by Jennifer Badger (who is our Cordy stunt double)  Badger can be seen in the opeing of last week's ANGEL playing the part of the frightened victim of "evil Angel."

<DD>Kane - All I can tell you sir is that if I should ever leave this show I will be happy to come on here and answer ANY personal question you may ask about anything.  I may even write a book about my experiences on BUFFY.  I promise you will have a lot to read if I ever feel the need to do that.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Spikey.<BR>
<BR>
Dubo - It's kinda scary sometimes.  It's real hard to find someone who matches her that closely yet has the Martial arts movie background that she does.  In fact, Sophia's the only one who really fits the bill.  The rest are just what we call "flip-girls" in the stunt business.  In other words they fight like wimpy cheerleaders and flip around.  So I thank my lucky stars that we have Sophia.  Especially when I watch some of the shows trying to have a "Buffy-type" fighting girl as a major character.

<DD>David's chick - So far I've choreographed the action on BUFFY since season 2 started.  May I say that David is very lucky to have a chick like you?  Well... I think I can tell what a girl is like by her typing on a newgroup.  I feel I know you already.  You like candy don't you?  Aha!  See.<BR>

<DD>HELLO BRONZE PERSONS<BR>
<BR>
Vox - Tell Brazenlee that Sophia and Sarah look so much alike in size that it is impossible to tell them apart when they are both dressed in the SAME outfit.  What happened on that episode (and you will see happen again on another future episode) is Sophia wearing a special outfit that has wrap around pads built into it.  Usually with a Buffy jacket you won't notice the stunt pads.  But with those sheer outfits it shows up.  Plus the fact that they are not even the same col<i></i>or or material doesn't help either.<BR>
<BR>
I can't really go into all the reasons for these things happening.  All I can say is that it's not our choice.<BR>
<BR>
And thanks PhilPhuD for the nice words.  I'll tell Sophia what you said. How's the Mrs?

<BR>
Bats: I WISH my dad was Dave Thomas (then I wouldn't need two jobs!) *g* Oh, I forgot that I'm a geezer! I actually saw Van Halen with David Lee Roth (twice) in concert and Metallica with the original bassist (Cliff Burton). Not to mention my front row seat at a cool Beethoven show way back when...*g*<BR>
<BR>
Dalia: It's all political with those awards. I can live with it.<BR>
<BR>
FSM: Feb. 7th (details to come).<BR>
<BR>
David's chick: Don't mind Batra, she's <i>SLEEPY</i>! I play the guitar for Darling Violetta. We were in Faith, Hope & Trick and we do the theme to Angel. I still don't know about the famous thing, though.<BR>
<BR>
Menkhare: See you there!<BR>

Menkhare: We're playing the pre-PBP (I haven't checked the official site recently so I won't give away location...yet *g*) on the 18th. But we're playing the Dragonfly on the 7th and Spaceland (again with VC) on the 26th.<BR>
<BR>
Bats: Ditto on the sleepys. I like the roots but they'll soon take over the garden of me head...<BR>
<BR>
Dalia: Heya! Hope you're well. I too liked Shakespeare In Love but I agree on the lightweight thing. My friends and I were livid that it beat Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture...reminded me of the Jethro Tull Best Heavy Metal fiasco at the Grammys a few years back...<i>but I ramble</i>.<BR>
<BR>
FSM: Thanks! Um, Feb 26th but Dragonfly will be groovy, too!<BR>

Menkhare: Show went well! VC rocked the house, lots of me pals showed their support (y'all rock and you know who you are)! Couldn't hear a damn note that I played onstage (what else is new *g*) but I'm told it was alright in the house. <BR>

<DD>Noticed several posts regarding whether or not Buffy should have told Giles and her friends about Riley.  <BR>
<BR>
A vague notion that knowing about the Initiative would put one's life in danger was somehow... well, vague.  At least more than intended.  Just before the earthquake hit and after Buffy said she wouldn't tell a soul, Riley started to say "Good, it'll be safer for them--."  But I guess that didn't do the trick.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, the point was Buffy didn't tell the others, not out of loyalty to Riley, but to protect them.<BR>
<BR>
Hope that clears things up.
