<BR>
Angle Man - you are forgiven.  Take twice as many next year and we'll call it even.<BR>
<BR>
Charity/Toyota - thanks.  Composing tips: I am notoriously non-intellectual about my work methods.  The bit about my dog Joey giving me my ideas is just a smoke screen for the fact that I just wing it every time.  When I start to look "under the hood" to 
try to figure out what's going on in there, I draw a blank.  Nothing registers.  The honest answer as to how I compose music is pretty much mess around until it sounds cool.  So here's my advice: mess around until it sounds cool.  Then you're done.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry I can't be any more specific.  It's just a purely instinctual, unexplainable process for me.<BR>
<BR>
Cecily - no I haven't seen Shakespeare in Love, but plan to soon.  Looking forward to hearing the score.  I'm gonna sue his ass.<BR>
<BR>
samantha - oh, that.  It's Oz and Amy.<BR>
<BR>
Dirty Socks - in order'd be fine.<BR>
<BR>
FASTEDDIE - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Elizabeth - we had a big furby bonfire last week.  Why do you ask?<BR>
<BR>
Hey squireboy.  And Laurence, oh yeah, *that* nutball.<BR>
<BR>
CB - great to meet you too.  No body part autographs this year.  Next year, I will be signing ONLY body parts however.<BR>
<BR>
OK, kidding about suing Stephen Warbeck, Oz & Amy, the furby bonfire, and body parts.  Just wanted to be clear.<BR>

second-to-last post<BR>
<BR>
Sonja Marie - next year.<BR>
<BR>
gangfolles - there's no easy way to tell you this... I'm *not* your hero.  I just write the background music.  I don't write the scripts.  Being french, the word "composer" may have thrown you off...  That doesn't stop Joss from 
telling me what to do though.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, speaking of which, somewhere out there is a poster who complimented me on the music for "What's My Line" - you know who you are (don't worry it happens a lot, seeing as there have been 4 composers on this show) - and I had to tell her that was someone
else (it was Sean & Shawn).  I felt bad for her but I was rather amused.<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - yes, yes, thank you, thank you.  It's awesome.  I need a new place to put my Emmy now, since the certificate now occupies the shelf of honor.<BR>
<BR>
SlayMe - Ahh yes, I remember now.  Cool pics!  Why, how hairy I am!<BR>
<BR>
horizon - yeah, Cruel Intentions seems like a cooler movie.  Keeping my fingers crossed.<BR>
<BR>
VT- I never liked the leafs anyway.  Is Daryl Hitler still playing?  :)</SMALL>

Bruces Mom - you should be excited.  This show just keeps getting better and better.  Sometimes I watch a rough cut of an ep (like Dopplegangland last night) and just feel incredibly privileged to be working on such a great show.<BR>
<BR>
hey XG.  and hey Samantha, I see you.  re: the promo... who is whom?  (didn't see it)<BR>
<BR>
horizon - Consequences is 15, Dopple is 16 and wrapped last week.  They must be wrapping up 17, or close to it.<BR>
<BR>
OzLady - thanks for the t-shirt, and it was great meeting you too.<BR>
<BR>
LadyJack - Am I all ablur or what?<BR>
<BR>
DirySocks - I love Erika!  I love Erika!  Can I be a member?<BR>
<BR>
VT - yeah, that was a cool song they used.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - thanks.  No I didn't think to bring pics of Joey... next year.

Hey VT, the gregariousest poster I know.  Enjoy your dinner.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Pixie, I remember you.  It was nice meeting you too.  And devil too.  bec too.<BR>
<BR>
Jeff Darque - thanks.  the soundtrack won't be out for a while.  RTBS, I believe, is mistaken (but don't quote me on that).  I spoke with the head of TV music at Fox about a score album, and she said the song album had been pushed back to this fall.  There will almost certainly be no score pieces on the song album, and a score album won't be released (if at all, but several labels have expressed interest and I think it will probably happen) until 6 months or so after the song album.  See, people will get confused if the score album comes out first or at the same time and that will hurt sales of the song album.  (== Record Company logic)<BR>
<BR>
Slayed Soul - tell Missi I appreciate her efforts.<BR>
<BR>
DeM - lol.  VT and I switched bodies briefly as an experiment.<BR>
<BR>
Hey horizon, Froggie200 (what's w/ the frog names recently), Monique, AngelLover24-7 - hi and/or thanks as appropriate<BR>
<BR>
straka - for "Buffy" my influences are Bernard Hermann, Jerry Goldsmith, Danny Elfman.  My best ideas are generously donated to me by my dog Joey who softly hums to me as I sleep.  My other ideas, well, I guess they just live in my brain until I'm ready to call them up and send them into battle.<BR>
<BR>
Slayed Soul - who's your "friend"?  Can I see?<BR>
<BR>
Matt - Jane (wifie) and I had plans to see SI until everyone I know (and don't know = critics) who saw it told me how bad it sucked.  I guess bronzers are predisposed to liking SMG, but even taking that into account, the verdict seems decidedly mixed.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - Angry as hell I didn't meet you too.  The party was awesome.<BR>
<BR>
SarahW - you there?

mélanie - bonjour.<BR>
<BR>
elover - "Bad Girls" is not my favorite episode, though I must say even a so-so "Buffy" ep like "Bad Girls" still kicks ass compared to other TV shows.  Not my favorite score, either - just a lot of small noise and big noise.  Not much room for me to really play a big role in the storytelling.  "Consequences", though... that's another matter.  It is an awesome ep.  And I'm very happy with the score - much darker than usual.  (And "Dopplegangland" is amazing as well.)<BR>
<BR>
Kharisma - done.

Early for me I know, but I've got some time to kill, so here I am.<BR>

I was scrolling earlier and just wanted to say to Irish Girl - I bet you didn't know that in Canadian English the words for "mother" and "sister" are pronounced exactly the same.  So when I asked if you were Little Willow's mother, I really meant sister.  It's easy to get confused.<BR>
