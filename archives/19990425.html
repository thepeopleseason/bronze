<DD><b>*LB*</b> - did you email it to me?  I don't recall receiving any pics by email lately... or did Ron hand deliver it... that seems to ring a bell.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Hollyn</b> - well, me either.  I've been mainly work-avoiding for a couple of _years_ now.

<DD>Hey, so here's an actual Buffy topic: How many people posting to the Bronze are in the UK?  I've been getting email hits on our band website, and orders for CDs, from people in England indicating that they are watching the show.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently it airs Weds or Thurs at 6.45 p.m.<BR>
<BR>
Any Cousins out there lurking about?

<DD><b>wolfguard</b> - Okay, last thing on this thread... bas<i></i>ed on an NPR broadcast on this topic.  You want to know what the ramifications of this find are?  Think about racial politics in this country.  Now think Amerindian politics.  Put aside the genocide, think present tense, and what is the basis of any claim for special treatment by Amerindians?  <i>They were here first.</i>  The remains that you and ~ceridwen~ have been discussing <i>aren't Amerindian</i>... at least that's what the discovering archeologist claims... and all the scientists who saw the remains before they were seized by the state agreed with this conclusion.  I think the remains were, like, slavic or somethings.  Definitely wrong skull structure for Amerindians.  This is perceived as a big <i>problem</i> by some politico minded Amerindians.

<DD><b>~ceridwen~</b> - As I recall, this was less like landscaping, and more like reforestation.  With the irony being that there hadn't been a forest there to begin with.  The discovering archeologist was pretty fatalistic about the whole situation.  And of course, I'm basing all or my recollections on some, like, 20/20 piece or something, so I will drop this thread!! <br><br><BR>
<fnt size -1><i>z0mb should really be finishing his OWN dissertation, which is NOT in archeology!!!</i>

<DD><b>Wolfguard</b> - As I understood the nature and intent of the Corps of engineers actions, there was a heated debate regarding the ownership of the remains.  Part of this debate stems from Federal law, which states that Amerindians can claim ownership of all ancesteral remains.  Part of the debate also arose from the question of who owned the land from whence the remains came.  The first part of the debate is being decided by the courts (HAH!) bas<i></i>ed on a resolution of the question: are the remains Amerindian, or something <i>predating</i> Amerindians (this whole <b>issue</b> raises a host of debates in and unto itself!)  The resolution of the second question was made by an army colonel who, supposedly without orders, obliterated the site in the aforementioned way. <br><br><BR>
So, to answer your question in brief (um...) no more remains will likely be found where the originals were discovered.

<DD><b>wolfguard</b> - don't know what happend to the remains... but the Army Corps of Engineers "stabilized" the site from future "degradation" by bulldozing it, creating earthworks, and then planting poplars (i.e. trees) every three feet or so in a masking grid.  Pretty much gauranteed that no archeologist would ever be able to work the site again... or vampire (um, keeping this sorta on topic?)

<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Yes, they're not 100% sure.  They doubt I damaged my skull, so they're going to start with physical therapy and an anti-inflammatory pill, and not jump to any alarmist conclusions.  =)  Hopefully, all will be well soon in Erika-jaw-land.

<DD>Hello, everybody...just stopping by for a bit. I have a bit of a headache, so computer-monitors are not such a good idea right now.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I wanted to clarify that my birthday is actually December 7th.  Thank you so much to any and all of you who sent me nice Bday wishes!  See, what happened was the last time Justin updated my codes was around my Bday, so my code was bdaygirl.  When I typo'd it, (bdaygril), it became visible, and confusion ensued.  hehehe
