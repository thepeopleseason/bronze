<DD><aqua3615>Well, it looks like they've changed the codes, so until (if?) I get sent the new ones, I'll be posting in ecru.  =)  I actually need to get going, 'cause we do have a show tonight. (No, that's <i>not</i> self-promotion, that's my life.  You know how you guys can say, "Hey I have to go, I have a party to get to," or "I have work in the morning," or "Good news!  I got a promotion!" or "I got an A on my last exam," or anything else fun (or sad) that's happening in your life? Do people rag on you for that? Well, <i>my</i> life/job is Velvet Chain.  I'm not a VC salesman.  I just like posting here, and if someone asks me how I am, the band is always going to come up in coversation.)  <i>Anyway,</i> I hope everyone can get back to getting along, and I hope they do give Jeff his colors back, and I totally agree with <b>kim!</b> about continuing to password-protect his name.<BR>
<BR>
<b>cabin7man:</b>  Thanks, man!  =)  How about if I autograph it for ya?<BR>
<BR>
<b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  Thanks!  I'm looking forward to it!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Melody:</b>  You're very sweet.  Thank you.<BR>
<BR>
<b>KANE:</b>  That goes for you , too.  =)<BR>
<BR>
OK, I have to run.  I look forward to seeing you SoCal types tonight!  Bye!<BR>

<DD><aqua3615>Hi, everyone...<BR>
<BR>
I'd just like to say I had no idea color codes were such a big deal.  Justin - Apollo has always given them to me, and Jymm, and other band-types, (remember bellylove?) and I guess we just thought as long as we had them, and no-one had ever asked us to stop, we would use them.  I honestly like the color just cause it's easier for me to scroll!  I'm not kidding.  I don't need to "be treated like VIP."  I honestly just like posting here.  I think it's fun.  Or has been.  I haven't been involved at all with the Jeff P. discussion up to this point, (I don't fell qualified to give an opinion, since my only information has been garnered from this board), but I <i>will</i> say I think it's a foolish choice to un-highlight his name, since he has indeed worked on the show forever, and done a wonderful <i>wonderful</i> job.  If you guys want me to stop posting in color, though...I will.  Honestly.  I never intended to annoy anyone.  And again, I had no idea it was such a big deal.  I just happened to be scrolling, and saw the conversation, and my name being bandied about as an undeserving color-holder, and thought I should say something.  <BR>
<BR>
Peace<BR>
<BR>
Erika

<DD>Oops.  One more thing to leave you to think about ...<BR>
<BR>
slaygrl99 - Here's something for you:  I was walking across the lot and a voice called out to me, "Jeff look!"  I turned.  It was David B.  And He Dropped His Pants and gave me the Full Monty!<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  That was embarrassing.  Not to him.  Just to me.  And I thought, "God!  Don't any of these people use the underwear thing?"  Insane.  My left eye still hurts.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  You can think on that tonight slayergrl99.  <BR>
<BR>
I know.  eww and yay.  All over the place.  hehe<BR>

<BR>
wantoknow - I once leaped from a moving truck and shattered my ankle by stepping into a pot hole.  It was ugly.  Backwards it was.  ow.  Hurts like a chip in the head.

<DD>agSLAYER - I remember many years ago.  I was at a party thrown by the son of a famous director.  Someone introduced me to a guy that had worked on BEST OF THE BEST as an assistant prop guy.  They told me that he wanted to be an actor and asked me to keep him in mind.  I just remember how I thought that this guy really has something.  The women thought he was a real hottie.  His name turned out to be David Boreanaz.  <BR>
<BR>
So years later we met at a graveyard in Los Angeles.  He had gotten this little part on a show called BUFFY.  He was supposed to get knocked down with a shovel (in those days he couldn't fight well)and Buffy was to save him.  I said, "Hey.  You're an actor now.  Cool."  Little did we know how it would turn out.

<DD>Jewyl - briefs of course.  <BR>
And staying on that Topic a moment (and what a ground breaking one it is) James Marsters won't mind if I reveal this to you guys.  He's a cool guy.  I had to put a harness on him for the episode where Dru picks him up.  And I found that he refuses to wear underwear at all.  So I had to put this thing on him while he was in the total buff.  He just said, "Oh.  Sorry Jeff.  I never where undies."  I thought, "Man.  I'm going to not tell the guy who is wearing the harness next about this one."<BR>
<BR>
just something for the ladies to think on there<BR>
<BR>
I'll be seeing James, Eliza and some of my friends from the show in a month or so.  If you'd like to pass along a messgae then I'll surely give it to him.  He's got a lot of fans.  Me being one.

<DD>greeneyes - That was Kevin Foster doing those.  Brian had broken his leg doing a Cola spot and so Kevin has been doubling Marc since around January.<BR>
<BR>
Fog:  Yep.  And Todd makes the best margueritas in the world.  I can promise you that.<BR>
<BR>
stunt that I enjoyed doing:  Lots.  But I'd have to say that I was really pleased with the rig I set up for the "Gentlemen" to fly on in HUSH.  I flew two guys 400 feet only six or so inches off the ground.  It's very difficult to be that precise for such a huge distance.  Cost a lot to rent the cranse.  The most I ever spent.  But Joss wanted them to go from a certain place and that's how it had to be.  So we made it happen.  I was very satisfied at how it came out.

<DD>agslayer -  Frodo is right on there.  I'm very, very happy to answer any ordinary show question or something like that.  Go ahead and ask again and I'll respond.  I'm just trying to keep the other stuff addressed to me to the confines of email.  It's better for the people I care about here if I do that.  I want everyone to enjoy the show.  My work.  Sophia's work.  The cool writing.  And even the stuff that the next guy will bring in.  All good things in the BUFFY world that is.<BR>
<BR>
What was the question again about David?

<DD>Jett - Instead of being hateful on the PB to me, just email me and be as hateful as you like directly.  It's cool with me.  Or you can even talk to me and ask me anything that you may have concerns about directly, withouthaving to address it to a nice group of people whose only crime is saying they enjoyed my work on the show.<BR>
<BR>
email me instead at Jeffprui@idt.net.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone:  Please keep  giving my email addy out to anyone who is angry or wants to attack or even simply wants to drop me a line.  That way the PB can be free to discuss the story of BUFFY the show.  And not wild speculations and opinions about what goes on in my life.<BR>

<DD>... *sigh*  see what I mean.<BR>
<BR>
agslayer - email is Jeffprui@idt.net<BR>
<BR>
Allison - Because I've created HUNDREDS of action scenes which are shown around the world.  When you mention the word BUFFY you may just hear someone say, "Wow.  She really kicks butt!"  That would be me.  The show will earn some people millions for years to come and make them very, famous and wealthy.  <BR>
<BR>
I gave to the show the style of action it has.  Day in and out without fail.  Do I deserve to be called a VIP and have colors?  You better believe it.  <BR>
<BR>
again you can talk to me on your concerns about me by emailing to:<BR>
<BR>
Jeffprui@idt.net<BR>
<BR>
It really works.  Keeps me from having to post in color.  <BR>

<DD>GF and others like that - People I've never talked to before keep suddenly popping in with statements directed at me while I am not here.  Some even sound like threats to my career.  <BR>
<BR>
Here's what you and anyone else can do about it:<BR>
<BR>
I have a right to speak my mind about my own life.  I made a page about it.  I did not take up any board space with it.  Posted an url.  If anyone likes they can read it.  If not, don't. <BR>
<BR>
As far as talking to me or about me personally goes...  <BR>
<BR>
my email addy is:  Jeffprui@idt.net<BR>
<BR>
So please don't keep hounding people here about it or me and taking up space with these attacks.  Do what I did.  Make your own page.  If you want to talk to me about it, just email me.  Pass my email addy around to whomever wants to discuss it.  Just please leave the people here alone about it.  They are innocent of saying anything.  I'm the one who dared to speak out.  Take it directly to me. <BR>
<BR>
Leaving comments or questions here for me only brings me in to answer and then they start all over again with the nastiness.  I don't want that here.  So I'm trying real hard to be good under some really tough conditions.  So pass the email around.  I'll do my best to answer and put your mind at ease.  Promise.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I thank all of you for the kindness you've shown to me and if anyone has anything to say or is "confused" or "angry" or just wants to make a threat on my life or career, just give them the email addy above.  Okay?<BR>
<BR>
Take it to me.  Good deal.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Do not be offended by the words "fatherless Princess."  That means simply that a person is stepping in and trying to fill that role for his own gains.  I am the one whose Mother and Father have died while making BUFFY.  The father of the Princess is alive and well.  Just not talking to the Queen much now-a-days.  I'm sure you know how that can be. <BR>
<BR>
Love & kisses,<BR>
<BR>
Jeff <BR>
<BR>
So just keep posting the email addy whenever the latest attack comes in.  Tell them to talk to me.  And you can talk to each other about how cool the show is here.<BR>
<BR>
Alright then.<BR>

Hi Crimson, Melody, Erin, Mike-ff, Zelda, redsun, legs...<BR>

Miremba, I was hired at the start of season three.  I had my agent send in my writing samples (a produced "Ellen" and a spec "NYPD Blue") and *poof*, got the job.<BR>

Wow, Chelle, what a great compliment!  Glad we finally hit the board at the same time -- great to meet you!<BR>
<BR>
Angleman -- yes, sign me up for Dennis' fan club please... and oh, I don't remember the last line of the spell, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Kimber -- I'm a big Jonathan fan, too... I hope we'll see him next year, but I don't know for sure.<BR>
<BR>
Troll -- about my eps for next year all I know for sure is that I'm writing one Angel.  I'll probably write three Buffys, just doing the math of it, but that kind of thing just sort of works out as it works out, you know?<BR>

Hey lurkingb, my pal!<BR>
<BR>
Amelia -- hi!  thanks!  How hard is it to get into screenwriting?  Kinda a trick question -- if you live in LA, and you work to get good at it and you have a little luck, then it's not too hard... otherwise it's tough.  It's just such a strange job.<BR>
<BR>
Lamech -- ooh, lots of questions... don't know if I'll hit all of 'em.  I've done some occult research, especially for the witch-hunt episode, but I don't really think any of what I learned made it into the script.  The rest I just make up.<BR>
<BR>
Future projects?  Well, lots more Buffy eps, I hope.  Maybe features.  Maybe create a show of my own someday.  I'm a Trek fan and I'd love to do something set in space.<BR>
<BR>
Writer's block -- doesn't really happen when you're paid to write... you just have to do it, so you do!  Also, it doesn't really happen on Buffy because the stories that Joss helps us break are so much fun you can't wait to start
writing!

Didn't mean to come on so strong.  But I've been getting hammered by people that I've never heard of complaining as if I made them read something that was not posted here.   So they bug me.<BR>
<BR>
Then again, I'll bet if you've been through the shock I've been through then you just --- might --- maybe--- understand how I --could--possible--- be a tad upset.<BR>

Got lots of ideas for new stories though.  Cheap - btw.
