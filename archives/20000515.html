A quickie to Circe/PR Gal - full name is indeed "Jean-Christophe Beck" and that's how my credit used to read, but it just confused people who knew me as Chris.  So I dropped the "Jean".<BR>
<BR>
Confuses the hell out of telemarketers though when they ask for "Jean" and I say "speaking".<BR>
<BR>
OK really gone now

<BR>
devil - "devil" doesn't sound ukranian at all, what are you talking about?<BR>
<BR>
Eiddileg - I have a feeling I will *not* be riding an emu.  Or a BeMu for that matter  :)<BR>
<BR>
Polgara - sure I'll post pictures, if I ever figure out how to do that<BR>
<BR>
DeAn - Yes, that would be my brother Chilly Gonzales who charted in the UK.  You can check out his CD "Uber Alles" at amazon.com.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks SockS, and especially DarkLady for feeding my delusion...<BR>
<BR>
I'm off to spot the last Practice ep!<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Circe - but MeeB posted!<BR>
<BR>
elusio - I think it's actually Joss who chooses Giles' songs (part of the script, I'd guess), but I'm sure John King is there to tell him when he picks something ridiculously expensive.<BR>
<BR>
SarahNicole - lol, I think you've been watching too much Buffy<BR>
<BR>
Hi to ZBear<BR>
<BR>
Catherine - Well I don't *have* to attend any birthing classes, and I'm welcome to sleep in a tent in the yard if I don't, but I like it much better in the house.<BR>
<BR>
tourogal - not to dis my wife's homemaking skills (and again I do like sleeping in the house) but if any nesting instinct were to kick in it would be welcome for both of us!  She's due on October 8th.  (Used to be 9th)<BR>
<BR>
BeMu = valley girl<BR>
<BR>
ShyGirl - oh but in my case chocolate is for breakfast

Lurking Girl - please, that is a SPOILER!  You're ruining it!  And as for next season, I'm holding out hope for a musical... but that would be just, well, a crapload of work and planning.<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - no projects lined up for after vacation, but I'll have my hands full with be moving my studio to a new part of town.  Re: The Practice, I haven't made any decisions yet.  But let's put it this way - it's not necessarily a forgone conclusion that I will continue scoring The Practice.  And see below re: my frustrations with the score album.<BR>
<BR>
I think I'm sticking with "Hush" for Emmys.  "Restless" is a much more original socre ("Hush" was very much influenced by Danny Elfman), but it's very nuanced and minimalist, where "Hush" was big and showoffy.<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander - hi<BR>
<BR>
Allyson - I like persephone.

Hi to Ian, KANE, Kameko, Spacebabie<BR>
<BR>
Anais - no, not tired - just ready for some time off<BR>
<BR>
StGermain, Jasmen - Jane and baby are both great, but see below re: denial.  As far as I'm concerned this baby is going to remain a fetus in utero forever, 'cause that seems so easy.<BR>
<BR>
BeMu - Hey congrats, which part of town?<BR>
<BR>
SarahNicole - Cheer Fever is a cheerleading movie set in high school.  Not exactly the stuff of epics but a very funny movie nonetheless.

Nick - My (former) assistant Alex Kharlamov wrote the techno bit at the beginning of Beer Bad.  Right up his alley.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - Jane is doing great, thank you for asking.  As to the rest, I'm just gonna remain in denial for a little bit, I'd appreciate you bot bursting my little bubble.<BR>
<BR>
TheaterGirl - yup, going to Africa for a safari with my dad and my brother.  Jane would come but she's afraid of snakes.<BR>
<BR>
Hi to EvilSIT, Buffluv, Cosmic Bob (oatmeal? so bland)<BR>
<BR>
DeAn - the album deal is in progress and it's been frustratingly slow.  A month ago they told me they'd come to terms within a week... but still no progress.  i do know they're in continued negotiations with several record companies, and one seems to be a front-runner, but I've stopped trying to estimate when this thing is gonna happen.  OK, I'll say this:  anytime within the next two months to two years.  Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Kendra, Kenickie, Lexdra - I'm trying to be patient... but I wanna see some hippos like NOW.
