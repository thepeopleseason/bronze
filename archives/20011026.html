'Cause there's nothing to tell...<br><br><br>Tiggy:  Yeah, I'm on a tight deadline for my latest animated script.  They should start recording my first two sometime next month.  As for your e, I will sit quietly by my computer until it arrives.  Wait wait wait.  Sigh.  ;)<br><br>Lupe:  I'll see what I can do.  Oh, wait -- I have no power.  Sorry.  How about a nice balloon animal?<br><br>newt:  Always exciting to see my Buffy stuff on the TV.  Look!  Moving pictures.  Mmmm.  Pretty.<br><br>cowskunk:  Beats the holy heck out of me.

<dd>Tiggy:  Don't think you've escaped my keen discerning eye.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  You're much sweeter than I.  And hey, how about sending me a demo too?  Huh huh pretty please?<br><br>OldManFan:  Guilty as charged.  Xander, Anya, and Giles' costumes are specifically described in the script.  You can thank me later.<br><br>gaia:  Well, by day I'm a mild mannered Buffy writer.  But by night I'm Super Fantastic Pantsless Man!  I have many powers that cannot be revealed on a family board.<br><br>
