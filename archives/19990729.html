<DD>LOL...I picked 16 as a random #...guess I'm psychic.  Anyway, <b>PLEASE DO GO VOTE!</b>  I'd be really grateful for the support.  Thanks so much...and you get a FREE mp3 of Tresaon while you're there!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the link, <b>Mike-ff!</b><BR>
<BR>
Bye<BR>

RSO's to <b>Oki'LLbyte, Brittany, and 4paws!</b>  =)<BR>
<b>WitchyWoman:</b>  We were on the Trinity River, way up in Northernmost CA.<BR>
<b>Mike-ff:</b>  Well, I had a feeling that would happen.  Se, having no internet access on vacation (for 15 straight days), I was unable to drum up any more votes.  We went from being #2, to not even in the running.  These things happen.  (Although, it is still possible we'll make it in, because QUITE a few of the bands who are supposedly beating us have male lead singers, or are inelligible in other ways...so we'll see.) PLEASE keep voting, anyway.  Coming in #16 could still get us in, you know????<BR>
<BR>
OK, I'm outta here.  Bye!

<DD><b>Mabb:</b>  LOL  =)<BR>
<b>nya:</b>  Oh, there's nothing to be sorry about.  I just have been to busy to do the ENDLESS scrolling it would require to determine if we're still in the top ten.  All we need is to be in the top ten as of Sunday, and then we're judges by a panel of "experts."  So, it ain't over, you know?<BR>
<b>Angle Man:</b>  Hi!  Haven't seen you in a while.  Yes, I know about the Canadian fashion spot.  We licensed both "Don't Leave a Diva" and "Watching You" to two Canadian fashion shows:  "Fashion Television" (which airs in the States on VH1) and "Ooh La La."  Sorry "Warm" is so expensive.  Tell people to order it.  We have a SPECIAL DEAL for Canadians now, where we charge same the SAME RATE for shipping as we do within in U.S.  (To offset any exchange-rate nastiness.)  Pretty cool, eh?

<b>Mike-ff:</b>  Ah...so you're coming down for the show, right?  That's right...you requested a ticket.  D'oh.  Forgive me.  I think I sent it out to you yesterday...

<BR>
I'm doing well, thanks.  No word on Lilith Fair.  The voting closes on August 1st.  (Sunday.)  I'm not sure we're in the top ten anymore...but I still appreciate the voting you all did.  Really.<BR>
<BR>
I'm really looking forward to our gig next Friday (the 6th) at the Key Club.  It should ROCK.  Lots of new songs, etc.
