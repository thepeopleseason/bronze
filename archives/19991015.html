<DD><b>Kalika</b> - - Gee, you just don't stop with the abuse, do you?  I'm not sure what I've done to you to deserve this incessant attack, but whatever it is, I'm sorry.  I'd stick around, but my ego is a little too fragile to stand up to these non-stop verbal assaults.<BR>

<DD>Not scrolling, not lurking, just wanted to pass on Nicholas' hello to all he met at the Season Two PBP at the now defunct Planet Hollywood, the Seattle PBP at the now defunct Planet Hollywood, and to the 132 people who posted birthday greetings to him on his 11th birthday a couple years ago.  Can you believe he is 24 years old now, married, with two kids and a mortgage that keeps him up nights?  Man, they just grow up so fast.<BR>
<BR>
That's it.  Really gotta go for now.  I think it's actually Monday here in LA now, and I'm not supposed to post on school nights.  Besides, I really only came here for the VIP's and to sadly recall when I could post in col<i></i>or... and to see <b>Destructo Girl</b>... and <b>Malista</b>... and <b>MeeB</b>... and <b>Lovely Poet</b>... and to be scolded by <b>DeMoriel</b>... and biographied by <b>Angle man</b>... and scared by <b>ripley</b>... and ripped by <b>Kalika</b>... and to p*ss off everybody who posted to me who I didn't respond to.<BR>
<BR>
So... my work is done.<BR>

Okay, I have to answer the "fave scene" question.  I'd have to say in "Band Candy" where Joyce and Giles drink Kahlua and listen to his record collection.  Also the one where Giles breaks the window and they end up having sex on the police car.<BR>
And in "Earshot" I like the one in the library where Buffy hears everyone thinking.<BR>
And in "Harsh Light of Day" -- well, just look for the one where Spike is shirtless.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for all the "Earshot" praise -- much of it belongs to Joss.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm very possibly leaving now unless I see another question that draws me back in... so... bye!

<DD><b>Malista</b> and <b>DG, the Queen of Canada</b> - - I really can't stay.  I have not quite figured out how the time zone thing works here in LA, but I think it's almost 5:00 am here, and if I don't get to sleep, I'll miss Saturday morning cartoons again.  And then, I'll be cranky all weekend long.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe I'll try for L.O.S.E.R.s soon.  I really only just popped on the board to spread the word about <b>ripley</b> in a hope that it might stop the killing.<BR>
<BR>
Forgive me.  I have to call home before the boys call it a night.  Eleven hundred miles away from home is too far.<BR>

<BR>
About Earshot and the Austin clock tower... I didn't even know about that.   I don't find it too weird except that I wrote a draft of Texas Chainsaw Masscre 5 that included a reference to that tower.<BR>
<BR>
Riley versus Parker?  Hmm.  I think either boy would be easy to fall for.   Keep watching and you let me know which one you like, okay?  Or is it someone else???<BR>

Have fun watching Tuesday!

<DD><b>Jane</b> - - I want to apologize for depicting <b>ripley</b> as scary in my earlier posts.  In fact, <b>ripley</b> is the least threatening (I can't read this word)... that I know.  In fact, <b>ripley</b> is a paragon of sanity.  So again, I apologize for my earlier mischaracterizations of <b>ripley</b>.<BR>
<BR>
<b>ripley</b> - - There, I've read the whole thing exactly as you wrote it.  Now, for god's sake, let my family go.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kalika</b> - - No, you were right the first time.  Sham I am.<BR>
<BR>
Well, kids... rumor has it that the actor who played "Stevie" on a third season episode of "The Smart Guy" is going to be posting on the "The Smart Guy" posting board tonight, so I've got to hurry over there.  <BR>
<BR>
Until then... Be well.  Be swell.  Be... uh, jell.<BR>

Okay, let's try to answer some of the questions.<BR>
I don't think Angel has been given an order past the initial thirteen -- I certainly haven't heard about it, and Joss didn't say anything about it today -- it would be early for that sort of thing.<BR>
<BR>
About Spike -- you can expect to see lots of him doing all kinds of things... things you can't imagine!  Things that make me smile.  Marti is smiling too.  Also Tracey.  We're all smiling.<BR>
<BR>
About writing the cross-over that's on Tues -- it was interesting tying the stories together, but not nearly as hard as the crossover in week eight, which I also did half of, because the Angel half of that one started filming before we had even completely figured out the Buffy half... it was wild!  But it all worked out in the end.  And, may I say, wait till you see Angel ep. 8 -- it's incredible!

Someone asked about the shot from the credits with Buffy dancing.  Well, watch your Buffy closely in the very near future and you will see the origin of the shot with the mystery man.  I can't tell you if you're right, you'll have to watch.

<BR>
So now, in shame (and fear of <b>ripley</b>), and in response to an old familiar command from <b>Lovely Poet</b>, I must slink off into the night.<BR>

Yeah, that's right... my ep is on Tuesday, and the second part on Angel is by Doug Petrie... I think you'll find that the whole thing rocks!<BR>
I actually met James Marsters for the first time a couple days ago on the set where they were shooting my next ep of Buffy -- I thanked him for the great job he did on the one you'll see Tuesday... he's really amazing, wait till you see!   You'll love it where he wears the thing and does the thing...<BR>
<BR>
The next one of mine after that is Angel's "Rm w/ a Vu."  I can tell you that it's Cordilicious.  And lots of special effects!<BR>
<BR>
What am I doing tonight, you ask?  Supposedly polishing another Buffy ep, but really making popcorn with hot sauce and talking with all of you!

Ooh.  An Ellen question... unusual!  Yeah, I was there the season AFTER the coming out "puppy" episode.  It was an interesting struggle because a 35-yr-old woman who just realizes that she's gay can't really NOT date... it would make the coming out meaningless, we felt.  And, since the show had always suffered from the lack of a point of view, we took this new aspect of her life and just ran with it.  In retrospect, maybe a mistake.  But we wrote many episodes that I'm very proud of -- lots of funny, lots of truth.<BR>
And, by the way, I still maintain that episodes about her daily life with her girlfriend were no more about "gayness" than Mad About You was about "straightness."  <BR>
So anyway, an interesting season right up 'til they yanked us off the air!

<DD>  Okay, bowing out now.  But here's some fun BRENDON FACTS:  Nick Brendon is a actor on TV, he has show on that is called Bufy against the Vampires.  His hair is dark and he says the lines on the show.  I like when he is funny, he pretends to be silly and he has a violent hatred of lithuanians.  (certain facts may be false).  Well, goodnight everybody!  Have a great weekend, and remeber, we're all gonna die one day!!!<BR>

Okay, technically I'm goofing off on the computer but I'm actually in the middle of a grueling vidfest to help me get inspiration for my next ep, which will be (I humbly submit)  the most DIFFICULT and CHALLENGING and therefore potentially the SUCKIEST episode I have made to date!

<DD>can't stay long -- and the computer censor ****ed up my Diagnosis Murder joke, I spent WEEKS on that joke, dammit!  life goes on.  Good news:  The network has given Angel a FIVE YEAR pick up!  They are changing New Tuesday to Joss is the MAN day (or possible "'da man," their legal teams are working it out).  Also the network will be called Jossyland.  all executives will change their names to Joss and certain household items (Soap, ziplocks, lard) will be known as Joss as well (I was against the lard).  All this in testament to the fact that I am so humble and have not gotten a swelled head at all.  Isn't that nice?

<DD><b>Sachiel:</b>  Yay!  Glad you liked it, but what should the name be??  Please e-me, so I can fix your info, OK??<BR>
<b>Kendra:</b>  Hi, there!  I'm doing well, thanks.  And yes, I am!  I thought the last episode was really funny.  Kind of goofy, but I like goofy sometimes.<BR>
<b>slay_me:</b>  Hey!  =)  Well, there's always news...  Um, I guess the latest is that the PR firm we hired is getting pretty good interest from magazines, etc., and hopefully there'll be more articles about us in the near future.  Oh!  And we got national distribution for "The Buffy EP," so any of you guys who don't have it yet can get it at any Tower Records or bor<i></i>ders Books in the country.  (Wherehouse ordered it too, but it was a smaller order...)<BR>
<b>Carita:</b>  Hehehe...that's so cool!  I hope it was worth the wait!<BR>
<b>WatcherX:</b>  You know it!!!  Would you believe we don't get a free copy?  LOL  I have to order some from amazon.com!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Silverclouds:</b>  Hello!  <BR>
<b>X'Lander:</b>  Cool!  Glad to hear it!  FYI, the one being released nationally is different.  Two more tracks, and a slightly different cover.  <i>(Hint, hint...buy the new one...)</i>  j/k<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Hey!  I know!  Wish you could make it...  Yes I did, but as I just posted, we're now going to be in bor<i></i>ders, too, OK?  Does that help?<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  I should!  Although I drink tea...  I'm fine, thanks. You?<BR>
<b>Eiddileg:</b>  LOL!  Well, yes, I should think "Strong" is an improvement over "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood..."<BR>
<b>chi:</b>  Yes!  Busy busy busy...we should have a full-length brand new album out by March!  =)<BR>
<b>DoBoy:</b>  Yay!!!  I'm really happy you all liked it.  *blush*
