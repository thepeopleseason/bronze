<DD>Hey Kids!  That said, I am AUDI.  Gotta go have some quality wife time.  Oh, and how 'bout we try this . . . . if Labrynth comes in, and doesn't scroll, play along and say you heard I was dead.  (And if you DO scroll, Lab, I'm just going to have to punish you later.  And I don't mean in the good way.  : )

<DD>Vampyr--Dark Horse at first blew me off.  Later, though, after I went to them with the Spike & Dru thing, they kept coming back to me for more projects, which is nice.  And thanks for the compliments.

<DD>Hey ALL--see, this is what happens when Labrynth gets cold feet.  First, for those of you who saw her posts on this, let me tell you -- I'm fine.  The reason I'm fine is . . . it was a hoax.  Problem is (LABRYNTH!!) it was a bad one.  : )  See, we were kidding around about how everyone would hate her if I was in *her* care, and she got me killed.  It was funny at the time, so I said, just do it.  Tell 'em I'm dead.  I have, if you haven't guessed, a very sick sense of humor.  But she wimped out.  WIMPED OUT!  : )  Woulda been much better if she said I was dead.  Anyway, it was a hoax, and I put her up to it, and now I'm gonna have to punish her for not goin' all the way.  I know, I know, It isn't funny.  But neither is Austin Powers, and I still laugh.  : )<BR>

Carita--that's a sweet picture of Nancy, but not a great one of me.  I don't usually look that "grim".
