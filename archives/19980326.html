<dd>Michael 7770 - Crawford<br>
<br>
Rydini: hope to get new computer stuff and take a big vacation somewhere with Sophia.<br>
<br>
Angle Man - I helped design a stunt for CRUEL INVENTIONS already (although Sarah doesn't even know about it yet) I have seen the story.<br>
<br>
the heretic - I think she hated that make up the most. Just not what she had wanted.<br>
<br>
Dr. Strangepants: My buddy James Lew will be seen fighting Jet Li in LETHAL WEAPON 4 coming up soon. Check it out.<br>

<dd>XANA: We watched THE FULL MONTY tonight too.<br>
<br>
Skler: Vicadin is the word I keep hearing from Sophia.<br>
<br>
DeMorial: Kirbys move is in the show. Hope he likes the way Hong Kong stuntmen fall down and go splat.<br>
<br>
Lothos: The set is very happy. Joss is happy. David and I have been doing our "mafia boyz" accents. Everything is very Rosey. Sarah is also having a blast. The show is rocking at this time.<br>

<dd>Skler: A story about that: I was doing a fight scene one night and I joked about a "picture in red" because I always draw my storyboards with BUFFY in red and the others in other colors. Sarah got a hurt look on her face and walked away. I didn't know what was up. Sophia told me it was because Sarah didn't like what they did on the ROLLING STONES cover. I had no idea the thing even existed. I was referring to my storyboards. I went over and found Sarah sitting on a tombstone sulking and I gave her a pat on the shoulder. I told her that she looked great to me and not to worry about that cover. She just smiled and told me the story of the infamous cover shot. That's when I learned - SHE HATES THAT COVER. Never mention that thing again.<br>
<br>
end of silly story.<br>
<br>
Micheal7770: 1800 Stewart St. in Santa Monica (I forget the zip)<br>
<br>
Sparkez: Early in April the party begins. Yay!<br>

<dd>HELLO TO MR. Ty AND MR. RD<br>
<br>
... now some Buffy News Stuff ...<br>
<br>
On the topic we had going the other night regarding guest stars wish list - here is a response from two BUFFY-type guys:<br>
<br>
Joss Whedon: Lyle Lovette would be cool.<br>
Sarah Gellar: Howard Stern (followed by intense laughter) <br>
<br>
IN OTHER NEWS - <br>
Sophia went to the doctor today and got her arm put into a sling and was pumped full of muscle relaxer. Doctor advises r-e-s-t. Seems that muscles in the back swelled after the season finale' fight to cause a pinching of the nerves and thus painful throbing. Pruitt advises a nice Merlot.<br>
<br>
Joss &amp; gang sends flowers to Sophia and causes tough-chick to cry.<br>
<br>
BUFFY hiatus begins in one week! OH-My-Lord!<br>
<br>
President remains in hot water....<br>
<br>
El Nino again ...<br>
<br>
that is all.<br>
