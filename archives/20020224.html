<dd>Gotta go.  Pressing business.  As far as Firefly goes, it starts filming a week from tuesday.  I'm mind-bogglingly excited about it.  But don't think for a SECOND it's gonna lessen my involvement in th' Buf.  I've got next year so WIRED!  Angel, too.  Couldn't be more psyched.  I'll stop by when I can to give you all insights on any of the shows I can.  (though I reveal nothing...)  Of course, you just have to go to Ain't It Cool to see that Firefly is clearly a rip off of Andromeda, Farscape, Babylon Five, Dr Who, Quartermass, Imitation of Life (the one with Sandra Dee and Susan Kohner, not the black-and-White one) the Time-to-make-the-donuts ad campaign and of course, Star Trek (the board game, not the show.)  But maybe I'll tell you more soon anyway.  Oh, and a little shout to Kiba and britgirl -- if anyone sees them, tell them I said LET'S MAKE --     um, say hi.<br><br><br><br>(what is up with this computer?)<br><br>

<dd>steph, you're way too sweet. The interview was fun, you made me feel all important.  LET'S MAKE LOVE!<br><br>Uh, okay, wait... that may have been a bit much.  With hindsight.  Meanwhilst...<br><br>I really do want to apaologize to all the folk I didn't get hang with or sign for -- I guess I'm out of shape, not with the stamina.  But I appreciate each and every one of you, and when I see you again next year, LET'S MAKE LOVE!   NO!  Wait.  There's something...  I think it's my computer.  I don't mean... geez.<br><br>

<dd>I just want to say, anyone who's sitting around at a computer posting messages on a saturday night when there's all kinds of cool action happening in the world must be some horrific kind of loser.  Like a freak.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wait a minute....<br><br><br><br>Okay, this is just embarrassing.<br><br>On other fronts, The end of the season is shaping up spectacularly.  Just read a Marti script that freaked me, much with the tears and excitment, that woman rocks and also with the rolling.  Start shooting Firefly in a week, that's pretty exciting too.  So busy.  But still a freak/loser, so you'll all recognize me despite my incredibly manly beard.  Heigh ho.<br><br>

<dd>Just a flyby, but....<br><br>Speaking of John Cusack, how <br>about HIGH FIDELITY? I thought <br>that one was superb!!<br><br>By the way "Say Anything" topped <br>the list as all time best romantic <br>Comedy in Entertainment <br>Weekly recently. Apparently John <br>wasn't keen on actually holding <br>UP the boom box, but the <br>director insisted. That cautious <br>not so confident yet still defiant <br>look on his face is real, and <br>perfect.<br><br>
