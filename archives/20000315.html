<DD>I just can't stand to see anyone suffer...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Tracy:</b>  LOL!  Don't worry about it!  It's totally cool, and I've made similar mistakes myself.  Please don't be uber-embarrassed.  I am very happy you meant us, and thanks for sticking the stickers on stuff, and feel free to e-mail us anytime.  (You can always get more stickers if you send a self-addressed-stamped-envelope to us, btw.)<BR>
<BR>
Really, really, really gone, now.  Like, out the door.  Bye!

<BR>
<b>Tracy:</b>  ROTFLMAO!  Um, if you really did mean "Velvet Chain," then thanks.  If you meant "Darling Violetta," well they're a cool band, too, and I'm sure they'll be thrilled you have their stickers all over your stuff.  hehehehe<BR>
<BR>
P.S.  What do their stickers look like?  I want one, if they have some!<BR>
<BR>
Bye, all!<BR>

<DD>OK, this just BITES!  I lost that one, too.  (Server is busy...  And I hadn't saved it.  So I lost a HUGE post again.  ACK!)<BR>
<BR>
OK, lemme just say thanks and hi back to everybody, and I'm really happy you guys are looking forward to the new CD, and Yeah, if you win the lottery, and pay for me to go to the UK, you can come, too.<BR>
<BR>
<b>DreamingHawk:</b> Thanks for the compliment, I really appreciate it, and thanks for clearing it up, 'cause her voice in the 80's scares me.  But she's much much better now.  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Deadgal:</b>  No good advice.  Just picture what the show is basically about, and try and write something evocative of that feeling.<BR>
<b>sb6:</b>  Glad you like it, and we will!  =)<BR>
<BR>
OK, I really have to go.  Sorry I spazzed out.  (Kenickie!)<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and <b>EviLSIT:</b>  I really hope you can make it!  =)  It's all-ages this time, too.  So spread the word to any young friends you have!<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>

<SMALL>(Wed Mar 15 11:01:24 2000 63.208.241.168)</SMALL><br> 

<DD><b>chi:</b>  Yes, it is on both!  The slower version that's on the Buffy EP and the Soundtrack is actually off our very first demo CD, "Groovy Side."  Just FYI.<BR>
<b>Hollyn:</b>  LOL  Great idea!  Well, as I said before, there aren't any tour plans yet, but if the record does well, maybe in the fall or winter we can go!<BR>
<b>beautifulstars:</b>  You're forgiven!  ;-)  This new CD will be our 5th CD and our 3rd full length album.  However, there is some overlap between our demo "Groovy Side" and the CD "Warm."  (About 6 of the songs are the same.)  You can always order any of our music at <a href"http://www.velvetchain.com<BR>
">www.velvetchain.com</a>  (Secure server, major credit cards accepted.)<BR>
<b>Cobby:</b>  Hehehe...well thanks for the sentiment, and tell Jennie hi back for me!<BR>
<b>Greeneyes:</b>  I probably won't remember to e-mail you, but YES, you can use audio files on your site.  Just credit them to us (clearly) and make sure you link back to our site!  The files and mp3s are at velvetchain.com under "music."<BR>
<b>wiccachick:</b>  You did it perfectly, actually.  Since amazon.com has the Buffy EP in stock and also registers it's sales with soundscan, it's just fine if you order from them - even if it reduces the amount of $ we get - because it helps track our sales, which is very important if you want to impress the industry.  But YES, order "Warm" and "Moody Groove Music" from us directly.  (Rule of thumb:  If it's in stock at a major site - amazon.com towerrecords.com, cdnow - go ahead and get it there if you want.  If it's a "Special Order," order it from us!  You'll help us out and save yourself a TON of time and money.  This is especially true for overseas orders.)<BR>
<BR>
OK, round one is done...now I'll try and answer the newer posts...argh.  lol

<b>elusio:</b>  Thank you!  I wish I'd met you, too, actually.  I somehow managed to not meet anybody!  lol  (Well, a few people, but not as many as last year...)  I think it was because I purposely did <i>not</i> hang out by the VC table, being worried that it would make people feel pressured to buy something.  lol  Next time, I'll know!<BR>
<b>X-Lander:</b>  Thank you and you're very welcome!  Did the pic come out OK?<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  Bonjour!  Actually, I think "I'll Tumble For Ya" really did him in...lol<BR>
<b>KeppingFaith:</b>Well, hello!  I'm so glad you're enjoying them.  Wait til you check out the new one!  I'm so excited.  =)  I don't think we'll be touring vey soon, but it <i>is</i> a possibility that we could do it this Fall or Winter...depending on how the nw CD does, of course.  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Marty:</b>  I have no answer for your "q."  Sorry!  As for rafting, I <i>love</i> it, but can't afford to travel anywhere further than I can drive.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>faith5by5</b>  I'm OK, thanks.  Hanging in there.  =)<BR>
<b>Athena:</b>  We would LOVE to release a single in the UK, but have no means to do so, unfortunately.  Perhaps our new record (Moody Groove Music, out in the States April 11th) will help in that respect!<BR>
<b>wiccachick:</b>  Thanks for the kudos!  And hi!<BR>
<b>chi:</b>  The Amatomobile is back, and looks like new.  =)  So glad you're enjoying the CD...is this the Buffy EP you're referring to, or is it "Warm?"  And *blush* re: hummina!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  OK.

<DD><b>Kenickie</b>  I really don't know which one it is, I don't recall being told a city-location), but I have to tell you, I think it <i>may</i> be the "rival" one, because the person I've been speaking with didn't give me a firm date (i.e. "August"), but just said it would be sometime during the summer and that FSM was already committed to going.  I'm taking the whole thing with a HUGE grain of salt, though.  (Basically, we can't go unless someone flies us over there, so...I'm guessing we're not going!  lol)

<BR>
Thanksto <b>everyone</b> for their sympathy/good wishes re: my toe and the tetanus shot.  My arm <i>really</i> hurts today, let me tell ya!  Ouch!  (My toe, on the other hand, feels fine.  Ah, the irony...) ;-)</SMALL>

I gotta run!  I'll try and come back a little later, OK?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the help with the photos!  That one StG pointed me towards is OK, but I'd prefer a clearer/closer/me-less-nosey-one if I could find it.  =)<BR>

<DD>Hi, <b>Carita</b> and <b>andyourlittledogtoo!</b>  Retail is actually being kinda evil...but the album is coming out just so so SOOOOO well, I'm thrilled!  =)<BR>
<BR>
Retail-story:I went to work yesterday, and the very first thing I hear from anyone is that I personally have had over $1,000 worth of returns taken back on me.  (We work on commission, so this is baaaaad thing.)  Not 5 minutes later - about 10 minutes after I'd walked through the door - I'm putting away clothes when WHAM!  I step on a sensor-pin that was carelessly left on the floor, facing sharp-side up, and it goes all the way through my shoe, and deep into my big toe.  OWWWWWWW!  And GROSS!  I have to pull it out, and it feels really really icky and painful, and starts to bleed, and I'm bawling my eyes out (mainly due to the shock), and not <i>one</i> of the customers I pass as I limp over to a chair to take my shoe off even ask "What's the matter?"  or "Are you OK?"  Anyway, long story short:  I had to go to the urgent care provided by Bloomingdlae's worker's comp, and they gave me a big old tetanus shot, and I can't even move my arm today!  lol  <i>AND</i> they made me go straight back to work and finish my shift after they'd cleaned me up and given me the shot.  <i>AND</i> I didn't sell anything, so it was a complete waste of time. Sheesh!  (End of story...)</SMALL>

<DD>Good morning!<BR>
<BR>
Iwas wondering if you guys could do me a favor?  I'm trying to locate any good/clear photos of Seth playing with us onstage last year at the PBP 99.  Can you guys please help me out and/or spread the word?  We're really looking for ones where you can see both me and Seth in the shot.  (Even if I'm only in profile, that's OK.)  And we need them soon.  Please e-mail me above with any info...I know they're out there, 'cause I've seen them, but I forget who had them!  lol  Thanks!! =)</SMALL>
