<DD><b>Sarah W.</b> - - Actually, the woodchuck thing was a trick question.  The fact is that, even if a woodchuck <b>could</b> chuck wood, it still wouldn't chuck wood for religious reasons.  That woodchuck question always trips people up.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Angelique</b> - - Seems like we are doomed to eternal "ships passing in the night-hood."<BR>

Ooops, gotta go again.  Why won't my in-laws understand that you guys come first in my life?  WUWT... FM 95.7?<BR>

<DD>Alas, I must anon... again.  A few parting thoughts:<BR>
<BR>
<b>Angle Man</b> - - Saw my bio.  Loved it.  I think a more apt comparison than the "Ode to Joy"/Beethoven comparison is less apt than a Dr. Naismith/Michael Jordon one (I'm the doctor, you're "Air").  I may have nailed a peach basket to a lamp post long ago, but you made it into an art form.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Blackheart</b> - - I don't know what you did to get so lucky, but <b>F-b-N</b> seems like a prize.  Don't screw it up.<BR>
<BR>
<b>LadyJack</b> - - Don't know where you can go to hire imposters.  For the most part, I like to stick with pretenders.  It's a subtle difference, but one that will save you substantial coinage in the long run.  If you decide to go the pretender route, just look in the yellow pages for an outfit called "Pre-temps."  Mention my name and you get 10% off your first order.  As for the col<i></i>or thing, as Joss is my witness, I shall never go hue-y again.<BR>
<BR>
<b>DarkLady</b> - - A cross between Joss and myself, eh?  Well, I don't mean to rain on your parade, but that's not possible.  Joss and I have been trying to conceive for years, but thus far the only thing we've gotten for our efforts is great sex.<BR>
<BR>
As my uncle used to say, "Always leave 'em cringing."<BR>

<BR>
<b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, VT!<BR>

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, kim! !</b><BR>

Gosh, you two are just growing up so fast.  Seems like only yesterday you were a year younger.  Just remember: the important thing is not how old you are, but how old you feel (unless you're trying to buy alcohol, in which case the "are" thing supercedes the "feel" thing).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everyone who answered my 20 questions.  BTW, for those who question if an entire 20 questions ever <u>really </u>existed, I can assure you, they did.  Of course, about halfway through, the questions started getting pretty lame (it's obvious by my hypothetical #19 about woodchucks and wood that I was getting desperate), I did compose the full score of queries.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I should go.  This is the last day of my in-laws' visit, and I really should show my face.  After the first couple of days, the "I'm in the bathroom" excuse starts to worry and frighten them.<BR>
<BR>
Later, etc.<BR>

-- About seventeen.<BR>
--Charisma, by far.<BR>
-- With a spatula.<BR>
-- None of your damn business!<BR>

<DD>The origin comic, though I have issues with it, CAN pretty much be accepted as canonical.  They did a cool job of combining the movie script (the SCRIPT) with the series, that was nice, and using the series Merrick and not a certain OTHER thespian who shall remain hated.<BR>
<BR>
HELPLESS was directed -- beautifully -- by James Contner.  Anyone can tell you that directors are a sore spot with me -- most of them are lousy.  Spend a lot of time cleaning up after them.  But we have found a few Go  To Guys, and James is one.  I'm all over HELPLESS.  Our goal was to make an ep that was truly scary.  Think we kind of did.

<DD><b>Lauren-Alexis</b> - - I am glad it made you laugh, cry, etc., but if it didn't make you buy the products advertised in the commercials, then I have failed.  <BR>
<BR>
(And yes, I am not very good at accepting compliments.  I tend to get all blushy and make stupid jokes to mask my discomfort.  Which is just my way of saying "Thank you.)<BR>
<BR>
<b>LadyJack</b> - - No, I'm not "THE" Ty King.  I am merely one of a handful of individuals who work in eight hour shifts around to clock to create the illusion of an omnipresent Ty King.  And as for the col<i></i>or codes, I <u>have</u> them, I merely chose not to use them.  For, you see, in the past, when I posted using those codes, the others would often tease me... calling me cruel names like "col<i></i>or Lad" and "Hue Boy."  And though I would always try to act like their taunts didn't hurt me, they could easily see through my facade... to see that I was actually crying on the inside.  So, it is in an effort to spare myself that hurt that I have decided to stick to the default tan on black.  And hopefully, with the passage of time, those old psychic scars will someday heal.<BR>
<BR>
<b>VT</b> - - I <u>have</u> to go.  People are counting on me to refill the napkin holders and straw dispensers before the big lunch rush.  It <u>is</u> 39 cent cheeseburger Sunday, y'know.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, my gosh, look at the time!  I should be in bed.  Why didn't anybody say anything?<BR>

<b>Chrisa</b> - - Don't believe what you may have heard about me in here.  90% of the people who post regular are either folks to whom I owe money, or else they have been the victims of my unwanted sexual advance, so they badmouth me.  Such a bitter group.<BR>
<BR>
<b>OzLady</b> - - You're right.  I <u>must</u> be tired.  For some reason, I keep nodding off in the middle of your posts.  (Or is it the dingoes trying to gaslight me again?)<BR>

(unless this is just the damned dingoes trying to gaslight me or else one of the countless bitter and vindictive posters playing a cruel hoax)<BR>

<DD>But, before I go, I want to leave you guys with the most valuable tags of all - <b>the col<i></i>or posting codes</b>.  <BR>
<BR>
In order to make the letters appear blue, you just type a bracket, then the special code for blue, then another bracket.  In order to make the letters appear red, you just type a bracket, then the special code for red, then another bracket.  If you want to make the letters show up as yellow, you just type a bracket, then the special code for yellow, then another bracket.  I forget how to make your posts green.  Sorry.  But, the way to make your post orange is you just type a bracket, then the special code for orange, then another bracket.<BR>
<BR>
I only ask that you not abuse this secret.  Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: if you see any posts after this one from someone claiming to be me, you can be assured that it is <u>not</u> me.  That is how certain I am that I am logging off now.<BR>

<b>Intoit</b> - - Hi, back.  Ad, to answer your parenthetical question: unless my clock is wrong, it's a little after midnight here on the West Coast.  Thanks for reminding me, because I have to keep an eye on the clock since I promised myself that I'd be asleep before 2:00 AM tonight.<BR>

<b>Fly-by-Nite</b> - - Your exhortations for me to "GO TO BED" are persuasive and have convinced me to call it a night.  I'm not sure if it was the economy of phrasing, or the big ol' letters that did the trick, but this time, it's for keeps.<BR>

<b>Brad Grenz</b> - - So, you think the Vamps will inevitably evolve to reproduce, much like the Jeff Goldblum character in "Jurassic Park" (the original, not the sequel) predicted (correctly) that the dinosaurs would, eh?  Interesting thought, but your forget that "Jurassic Park" was only fiction.  And, I can't believe you didn't challenge my "'one' is infinite" line.<BR>

Well, since I said I was leaving, I guess I really should leave.  Because apparently, it's okay to lie about sex under oath, but it's not okay to lie about leaving... unless, of course, you are leaving for sex under oath, which would be a gray area, I guess.<BR>

<b>curlysue</b> - - Nice to meet you, too.  Before tonight, I was actually strongly in favor of allowing for human cloning.  However, I can now see that if such experimentation were carried out, it would only open up a can of worms as far as the whole Slayer question.  Therefor, I am officially changing my position and am now against further work toward human cloning.  Unless, of course, the Slayer bugs could be worked out, in which case I would flip flop back to the pro-cloning camp.<BR>

You say that there are "hordes" (sic) of Vampires and "only <b>one</b>" (sic) Slayer.  But, by definition, "hordes" (sic) is still a finite number while "<b>one</b>" (sic) is infinite.

<DD><b>joy</b> - - Interesting choice of phrase to say there is an "endless supply" of Slayers.  If this is true, and Slayers really are so disposable, wouldn't this perpetual bait and switch thing eventually dispirit the Vampire Brigade to the point of capitulation?  Or are they destined to be like Charlie Brown to the Watchers' Lucy with the football, forever falling for the same trick, ignorant of the fact that they are trapped in some Sisyphean parade of Slayers lined up on a cosmic Mobius strip?  Ow... headache.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Dolly</b> - - I'm jazzed about your idea for using genetic engineering to create an army of red herrings - a kind of Slayer three card monty to keep them guessing.  If the Slayer were to just hide out, it would leave a veritable hall of mirrors where every image is a reflection.  Not to mention what a good deal it would be for the Slayer if she ever needed a kidney or liver for a transplant, or just wanted to play a joke on her teachers.  And what a hoot to see the look on a Vamp's face when he brags to his Vamp buds that he just killed the Slayer, only to have them point behind him and say, "Oh, yeah... then who is <u>that</u>?"  I like this idea.    <BR>
<BR>
I really should go now.  But, let me leave you all with a word of advice in parting: if you step on a crack and it <b>doesn't</b> break your mother's back, that doesn't mean that the legend is invalid.  It could be that you just lucked out that time.  Just maybe the next time you step on a crack, the outcome will be different.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't push your luck.<BR>

<DD>Okay, I know the "four post" thing expires at midnight, but when does it rise again?<BR>
<BR>
Medical ethics question of the day: "If the technology existed to clone a Slayer, would the clone be a Slayer as well?  And, if not, wouldn't the clone's life be hell with always having to try to convince attacking Vampires that they have the wrong guy?"<BR>
<BR>
And, if the current Slayer were killed, and the next Slayer were to die at almost the same instant, would the Speaker of the House then become the Slayer?  <BR>
<BR>
Also, in the battle between Slayers and Vampires, isn't the whole "when one dies, another is chosen" thing really kind of unsportsmanlike?  I know if I were a Vampire, I would cry "foul."<BR>
<BR>
In addition, if a Vamp were impaled by a stake that had, say, four coats of a Polyurethane varnish so that no actual woodgrain came in contact with his heart, would that do the trick, or would he be the luckiest Vampire who ever lived?<BR>
<BR>
And while we're on the subject, if a Martian vampire with two hearts (hey, it could happen)caught a wooden stake through only one of his hearts, would the Slayer get credit for a kill on her scorecard, or would she have to stake the other heart to pick up the spare?<BR>
<BR>
These are the questions that keep me up at night.<BR>

Oh, and I would miss the Dodgers.<BR>

<DD><b>Sonja Marie</b> - - Oh, and I forgot that I would feel bad for the people in East Asia would would be hit by the giant tsunami that would be generated by the slide of L.A. into the Ocean.  I'd also feel sorry for any kids who were just about to finish up school geography projects that consisted of complex topographical maps of the U.S. made out of clay, because they would have to start all over.  And I'd feel bad for Kevin Costner, because he would die under the tragic circumstances of having "The Postman" be his last movie.<BR>
<BR>
But that's it.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Malista</b> - - As for the older Slayer question, I think the image of a fifty year old woman named "Buffy" would just be too much to handle.  And they would have to rewrite the little speech to be "In every generation, only one is chosen... except for Buffy, who continues to bogart the crown."<BR>
<BR>
<b>valMichael</b> - - Howdy, stranger.  So, which is it: "NO" or "TWO"?<BR>

<DD><b>joy</b> - - Leakage bothered me a lot when I was a "Buffy" writer.  Oddly, it bothers me even more now as a viewer.  Now, when Oz and Cordelia kiss next week, I won't be surprised.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Malista</b> - - Even if it were true that you are only as old as you feel, I would still be too old to be a Slayer.  I'd be the pathetic old "Chosen One" sitting on my front porch shouting, "Hey, hey... you Vampires get off my lawn!"<BR>
<BR>
<b>Sonja Marie</b> - - I don't mean to rag on L.A. so much.  It's just that Los Angeles let me down, broke my heart and ate the last piece of cheesecake I was saving in the refrigerator.  My feeling is that if a massive earthquake hit L.A. tomorrow, and the entire city slid into the Pacific Ocean, I wouldn't lose a minute's sleep...  <BR>
<BR>
I would be a little bummed about the loss of the Indian restaurants, though (which is the same reason I still miss the lost continent of Atlantis, BTW)...<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and I'd feel bad about the sea creatures that would be harmed by the resultant oil slick...<BR>
<BR>
But, that's it.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, yeah, <u>and</u> Uncle Hoggly Woggly's barbecue just east of the I-5 on Sepulveda Boulevard (almost forgot about that)...<BR>

<b>Mike-ff</b> - - There is no such thing as a "pointless" study of Arabic grammar.  Any time you spend in this pursuit will come back to you tenfold in the form of blessings.  (Just remember that "mu'lak" is the same in the singular declarative case as it is in the accusative plural, and you will be alright.)<BR>

<BR>
<b>Sonja Marie</b> - - I am only saying that Los Angeles will suck the life out of you, steal your soul, crush your dreams and leave just the shell of whatever contented being you used to be.  On the plus side, it does have some good Indian restaurants, though.<BR>

<DD>Another reason to turn down the Slayer gig: my paralyzing fear of wood and my tendency to respond to any sign of danger by wetting myself and passing out.  Besides, I'm really not a night person.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Xana</b> - - Thanks, but my "rock"ing years are long behind me.  I have, however, been know to still roll on occasion... if you get enough drinks in me.<BR>

<b>Ms. Alucard</b> - - Okay, so I'll be the one with the visible bra straps and you'll be dressed like Faith.  Call me Pollyanna, but I think this is gonna be the best darned Honest Cowards' Ball ever!<BR>

<DD><b>Brad Grenz</b> and <b>Alex</b> - - Okay, maybe it is unfair to question others' answers the Hypothetical #1 just because I'm a coward.  I just know that if I answered the call myself, it would be "Ty the Vampire Supper."  I would, however, sign up for Giles' job in a heartbeat.  But that's only because I like to Watch.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Alex</b> - - You're right; a normal season's episode order is twenty-two... except in a leap year.  And, by the way, please call me Ty.  "Colour Lad" is my father.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kazza</b> - - Aww, so sweet with your answer to #13.  You do realize, however, that if I were writing it, there'd be a whole lotta Hanson each week.  And as for hanging around Joss too much, that's all changed since he got the court order.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Okay, <b>Alex</b>, I'll make it a little more difficult: Three seasons of "Angel" or one more season of "Buffy", featuring the arrival of new recurring villains who call themselves "The Triad."<BR>
<BR>
Oh, did I mention that "The Triad" are played by Hanson...<BR>
<BR>
...and that the series would end in the final episode when the Brothers Hanson off the Slayer...<BR>

...without breaking a sweat...<BR>

<DD>BTW, kudos to <b>Ms. Alucard</b> for being the first to answer question #1 honestly.  I agree, but mostly because I look sad in Go-Go boots and a micro-mini skirt (although I can carry off the visible bra strap thing).  Looks like it'll be just you and me at the Honest Cowards' Ball.  (Look for me.  I'll be the one with the visible bra straps.)<BR>

<DD><b>Kazza</b> - - Good answers, except I lean more toward Sporty as the Slayer for obvious reasons, with Scary being an almost "separated at birth" with Kendra, and Posh being a terrific Cordelia.  I can see th Child Counselor - oftentimes those who survive incredible youthful horrors choose to go into a field where they can help others in similar circumstances.<BR>

<DD><b>TWENTY QUESTIONS <small> OR AS MANY AS THE DINGOES WILL ALLOW</small></b><BR>
<BR>
I know that most of these questions have probably already been posited, but I plead absence...<BR>
<BR>
<b>#1 </b> A hypothetical: A Watcher shows up at your front door tomorrow with the news that you are the next "chosen guy", but that if you choose to turn down the Slayer gig, the equally qualified first runner up will assume your duties with no hard feelings.  Knowing what havoc Slayerhood can do to your life expectancy, your family and friends' life expectancy, and your odds of ever having a relationship of the non-doomed variety, would you accept or decline the invitation?  <BR>
A) ACCEPT<BR>
B) DECLINE<BR>
C) ACCEPT IF THE WATCHER WERE GILES, DECLINE IF HE WERE MERRICK<BR>
<i>NOTE: Honesty counts more than political correctness here </i><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>#2</b>  If Buffy were to somehow rid the earth of all the nasties and slam the door shut on future Hellmouth type eruptions, thereby consigning the job of Slayer to the scrapheap, what would she chose for a career (that is, want to be when she grew up?)<BR>
<BR>
<b>#3</b>  Another hypothetical: You know that a band of ten vampires is headed toward your house intent on doing harm to you and your loved ones tonight.  Would you rather have your line of defense consist of Buffy alone (i.e. no Scooby Gangsters) or the two person team of Faith and Kendra?<BR>
<BR>
<b>#4</b>  What other WB show would you most like to see a demon spitting Hellmouth erupt beneath?<BR>
<BR>
<b>#5 </b> Which Spice Girl would make the best Slayer?  The worst?<BR>
<BR>
<b>#6</b>  If Ms. Calendar had not betrayed Buffy and Angel (or been killed by that b*st*rd, Angel), and Giles had decided to go for happiness in his life and marry Ms. Calendar, but the marriage were contingent upon Rupert's retiring from Watcherhood, would Buffy give the union her blessing if Giles asked for it?<BR>
<BR>
<b>#7</b>  Upon her death, would Buffy wish a call as the next Slayer on Willow, or want the honor/curse of the job to pass to someone far away?<BR>
