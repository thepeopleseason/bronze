<dd>Annie:  Thanks!  And sure you can have my baby.  I didn’t really care for the little guy anyway.<br><br>Abt:  You got it, sucka.<br><br>Hostile 17:  Thanks.  I also loves the evil sexy Spike.  Were they having sex up there?  Sure looked like it to me.<br><br>Dust’em:  I’ll try to keep it up.  The writing.  Really.<br><br>Genrefan:  Thanks! <br><br>Kaseyk:  Yeah huh what?<br><br>Spikeme:  Thanks.  And cool name.  There’s always more to Spike than anyone thinks.  He’s a twisted little nut to crack.<br><br>Leather Jacket: I believe you owe me something.<br><br>NumfarGirl:  Michelle did a great job.  What a sweetie.<br><br>Cashmere:  One of us… one of us… one of us…<br><br>JKSWONDER:  It’s the apocalypse!  Run for your lives!  But before you do, thanks for the kind words.<br><br>Fred:  I’m a slippery one.  It’s all that soap.<br><br>Undead:  Ah, yes.  All the Way.  I wish I could go back and change a few things there.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t.  But Michelle is great, as usual.<br><br>Tiggy:  The monkey ref was just for you.  Perv.<br><br>Paradox:  Nice catch. We did re-shoot Spike getting bloodied.  In the original, we completely demolished his face.  It was really brutal.  UPN, to their credit, didn’t have a problem with it, but Joss felt it was so horrific that it took away from the emotion of the scene.  And he was right.<br><br>Scourage:  Thanks.  Dead Things is muuuuch better.  Hope you like it.<br><br>Allyson:  That’s great.  I saw the beautiful stake in the box.  Man, that’s so nice I kinda want to bid on it.  But no – must leave something for the fans.<br><br>Little Willow:  Thanks so much.  Glad you liked it.  It was a labor of perverted love.<br><br>Archiac:  My time is never free,  You’ll be receiving a bill in the post.  Please remit promptly.<br><br>Natasha: Meat!  I already have an eye patch and a spy outfit.  I went to Shane Black’s Halloween party last year dressed as Nick Fury.  Cause, you know – nerd.<br><br>Paradox:  JM and SMG are totally professional about the sex scenes.  No problem there.<br><br>Puckles:  It’s all clear to me now.  And thanks for the free range.  Now I can run free!  Sweet!<br><br>Raindeer:  Visions of handcuffs in your head?  My job is done.  <br><br>Tralf:  Thanks.  The chanting put me into a deep meditative state.<br><br>Lilyana:  Thank you.  Now if I can only find the right woman to beat the crap out of me…<br><br>Jenkins:  Now who would want to kill Xander?  Hmm…<br><br><br>Gotta float.  Lunch time!<br><br>*poof*<br><br>

<dd>Neonate:  I appreciate your honesty.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I respect that.  But I won’t engage anyone in an argument over the merits of my work.  Down that path lies madness and intestinal distress.<br><br>Newt:  Yeah, here’s what happened in Mulholland Drive:  Lynch shot a pilot for TV series that the network didn’t like.  So he shot a half-hour more of some crap that had pretty much nothing to with the pilot, slapped it together, and suckered a bunch of saps like us into coughing up 8 bucks to see it.  As for the costumes on Buffy, I have so nothing to do with them.  But the green shirt didn’t bother me.  Eh, what do I know about fashion.  I don’t even wear pants.<br><br>Bdbdb:  Thanks!  I wanted to make Dead Things a musical, but that damn Whedon character won’t let me  near his piano.  It’s just plain selfish, I tells ya!<br><br>Natasha:  Hey super spy!  Thanks for the defense.  I have one more response to Neonate:  you think writing pornography is easy?!  It takes forever to do that stuff.  You write a few lines, get distracted, then you need a nap.  Took me three days to get through that balcony scene.  My legs still hurt.<br><br>Bullseye:  If I drop ‘em at the PBP, that’ll be my last official act as a Buffy writer.  You’ll just have to remove the offending trousers in Photoshop.<br><br>Phil PhuD:  Alas!  When I join the writing staff the Tales of the Slayer project was already divided up and being written.  Sniff.  Sob.  As for The League, I’ve heard very disturbing things about the script.  Something about including Tom Sawyer?  Shudder!<br><br>Cashmere:  Spike’s a very complicated man.  And a big part of him is still evil.  Evil, I tells ya!  Evil!<br><br>Tiggy:  Thanks.  Hey – I dreamed about the luncheon too.  Mmm… chicken salad.<br><br>Fred:  We really don’t use CUT TO’s: in our scripts.  Takes up too much space.  The wonky time scene was written out under one scene heading:  EXT. WOODS – NIGHT.  Within that, I explained all the various shifts in time.  Then the goddess that is Lisa Lassek worked some serious magic in editing.<br><br>Aly Willow:  Thanks.  And yes – any day is a good time to shed those pants.<br><br>Deadboy:  Thanks.  And yeah – I wished I had changed a bit of the post-mortem stuff.  I had planned to, but ran out of time.  Ah!  It’s always something.  <br><br>Angel Rain: Honestly, all the big story stuff spills out of Joss’ head.  He knows where he wants to go and how he wants to get there, and he’s not going to change that for anyone.  Personally, I agree with him.  If we start trying to change things to please all the fans, we’ll get a watered down vanilla show.  As for the sex – it’s a big part of Buffy’s troubles this season.  To short change that would do the story a disservice.  And a lot of it is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable.  Just like Buffy.<br><br>Leather Jacket:  All part of the demon temporal confusion. Plus, do you really think the Trio would plant a stone cold body for Buffy to find?  We debated adding a scene to explain all of that, but it just slowed the action down to a crawl.  Ah!  The Devil on one side and Hell on the other.<br><br>Ergoshakes:  I’ll let you go this time.  Grrr.  Don’t let it happen again, missy.<br><br><br>One more round, then I gotta fly.<br><br>

<dd>Paradox:  Thanks for the kind words.  The music in the graveyard scene was picked by the amazing editor for that episode, Lisa Lassek.  Keep an eye out for that name.  She’s going be huge.<br><br>Newt: Twisted?  Evil?  Heartbreaking?  Why, that’s me in a nutshell.  Thanks.<br><br>Lumily:  Thanks.  And big thanks to Joss and Marti for giving me such a juicy storyline.<br><br>Jenkins:  Xander will get what he deserves.  Trust me.<br><br>ShyGirl:  Woo woo woo right back at ya.<br><br>Noetic Concordance:  That’s right!  No pants!  End the tyranny of the trousers!<br><br>ReallyEnglish:  I like the soapy.  Keeps me squeaky-clean.<br><br>Paksennarion:  No.  The crappy Powers That Be are making me wear pants.  Boo!   Boo, I say, boo!<br><br>Raindeer: Thanks!  I’d love to have help, but that meddlesome Writers Guild might have something to say about that.  Kill Xander and make him a vamp?  Hmmm.  Interesting.<br><br>Cahsmere:  Kinky sex?  You guys think THAT was kinky?  Jeez.  I thought that was pretty tame.  Maybe the doctor’s right.  I am a perv.<br><br>Del:  Thanks for the kind words.  And yes please – call your friends.  Tell ‘em Steve says hi!<br><br>Carrots:  Creepy Steve thanks you.<br><br>Kestra Troi:  Poke poke!<br><br>Puckless:  Thanks.  As for ep, 19, it’s not really a dark ep. (honest), but I’ll do my best to creep it up for ya.<br><br>OldManFan:  See you at the PBP.  Whoo and hoo!<br><br>Kwinakian:  Thanks.  Can always use more slaves.  Start peeling those bananas, you saucy little monkey!<br><br>Greeneyes: You’re welcome.  Here’s a hanky.<br><br>Tiggy!:  Always an honor.  I’m keeping EVERYTHING I have crossed.  Right now, it looks like I’ll make it.  I’ll keep you posted.  Make sure you e me a number I can reach you at in LA.  And the rest of you rabble – SEND SWEET TIGGY YOUR PICS FOR HER WEBSITE.  Don’t make me bust you up, sucka!<br><br>NumfarGal:  Thanks.  See you ate the PBP.  I’ll be the one with horns and a tail.  <br><br><br>Speaking of the PBP, I just donated the original Writer’s 2nd Draft of Dead Things (with my notes written inside) for the auction.  One of a kind item, with a slightly different dream sequence that’s, um, a bit more shall we say disturbing.  Toss some money at it for Make A Wish.<br><br>

<dd>Ah ha!  The big switch up!  I'm going to be off writing episode 19 tomorrow, so I thought I'd drop in for a little pre-pantsless Friday fun.  Start the giggles, baby!<br><br>
