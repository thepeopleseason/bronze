<DD><b>OzLover:</b>  Hmmm...you didn't quite answer my question, sweetie.  =)  To where did you "send off for it?"  To LAMA?  To Freak Productions?  To Velvet Chain?  I personally oversee all our orders (I know, it's hard to believe!), and I am sure that if you ordered it back in November, even with the backorder problem we experienced, you would've been all set by Jan 10th.  So, what I need you to do, if you did indeed send a check to either Velvet Chain or LAMA, is to find out whether or not it's been cashed yet.  If it hasn't, that means it must've gotten lost in the mail.  (icky)  My e-mail is on this post.  Please feel free to contact me about your order.  (Of course, if you sent away for it to anywhere other than either LAMA or Velvet Chain/Freak Productions, I can't help you.)<BR>
<b>NuPhalanx:</b>  They were quite good, thanks!<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  Talk to you soon, then!<BR>
<b>Neophyte:</b>  no, I really have no specific time...I stop by pretty regularly, though!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Llewellyn:</b>  We haven't played in NYC since we toured last year.  Hopefully, we'll be able to scrape together the finances to do another tour this Fall.<BR>
<b>TheVaedus:</b>  Oh, my!!!  Well, that's quite a compliment, to be sure.  Thank you!

<DD><b>Neophyte:</b> Well, hello; nice to meet you...and thank you very much!  =)  Have you been to our site?<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Always true; never tiring; there he is:  my Knight.  I<BR>
am well, and how are you?<BR>
<b>Ozman:</b>  Well, if we haven't alked before, we're doing it now.  hehehe.  I'm OK, thanks.  A bit tired, so I'm probably gonna leave pretty soon.<BR>
<b>princess daria:</b>  Hi, there!<BR>
<b>CharlieX:</b>  Ah, well...it's the thought that counts.  ;-)<BR>
<b>Llewellyn:</b>  Sorry to hear that.  Are you British, by the way?  Or just an Anglophile??<BR>

<b>Jasmen:</b>  Hi, there!  You enjoy your evening, too, K?<BR>
<b>Natalie:</b>  Howdy!<BR>
<b>OzLover:</b>  Hmmmmmmmm....that is NOT normal.  From whom did you order it???  If you order any of our CD's from us, you usually receive them within a week to ten days of placing the order.  (Sometimes it's even faster than that.)<BR>
<b>WaxTadpole:</b>  Hi, there, sweetling.  Go ahead and post 'em.  I think they're a riot...but only if you know the song really well.  hehehe
