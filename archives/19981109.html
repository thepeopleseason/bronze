<b>Sanguineus:</b>I swear I wasn't there.  Maybe it was a picture of me from somewhere else?  Or it was an imposter?  (Or, more likely, just someone who looked like me...)</SMALL>

<DD><b>?:</b>  Well, I guess I'd like to say that I deserve the award this month for my tireless singing-into-submission of both errant tags and bezoars alike.  I am not a very violent type, so I prefer to subdue the creatures with music.  A vot for me is the compassionate vote!!  (LOL)  No really, I'll ram a spear through'em if I have to, but I can usually get'em with more wiley methods...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Shtein:</b>  Hello!  I e-mailed you.  did you get it?  I got a mailer-daemon massage from all my e-mails to hotmail addresses...anyway, the answer is yes, I'll send them to Israel.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Ali/Briolette:</b>  Oh, about a week or so.  Depending on the post office.
