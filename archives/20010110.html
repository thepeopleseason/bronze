<DD> Sorry guys!  Got a phone call and now I have to bail.  Thanks, thanks, thanks for all your support and for watching Buffy!

<DD>  Wow!  lots of questions...<BR>
<BR>
1:  Ummmm.  Bruce Campbell...  He's dreamy.  Still, I'd have to say my dream guest is Eddie Izzard.  I would follow him to the ends of the earth.<BR>
<BR>
2:  Yeah - I got married.  It's wonderful and I'm very happy.  Only Eddie Izzard could come between us.<BR>
<BR>
3:  Something big is coming up for Xander - but if I told you, what fun would that be?<BR>
<BR>
4:  What we mean by breaking story is that we break down each script by each individual scene and decide what happens, step by step.  It's a long, sometimes painful process - but when he get it, it feels great.  Some shows are easier than others, and sometimes we never quite nail it - but sometimes we have the magic ones, the ones that feel like something special.  And that's the stuff that you dream about.<BR>
<BR>
5:  Sarah is excited about the GG's.  I'll wish her well from ya'll.<BR>
<BR>
6:  Flamey - I came upon the idea for that scene because of your flamey brilliance.

<DD>  Hat!  Sweater!  Knock it off or I'll have to unravel  you two!  <BR>
<BR>
Yes - crossovers a'comin'.  <BR>
<BR>
And I guess I will be doing a seminar at UCLA in Feb (thanks for reminding me.)  They want me to do some smart talkin' - so I better bone up on that now.  "The inverse of the Buffy paradigm is based in a semiotic breakdown of patriarchal mythology - blah, blah, blah... Me...  Blah, blah, blah, Me... "

<DD>  Thanks, everyone, for nice words about our words.  Warms me up on a cold, rainy day (and yes, I love it...)<BR>
<BR>
I think Riley couldn't hear Buffy.  I think he was hoping she'd show.  Bad timing, huh?<BR>
<BR>
And - btw- Oh, boy - we've got some cool stuff in store for you guys coming up.

<DD> As for the fates of Oz and Faith - we love them as much as you do.  But here's the down side of good casting - when you put cool people on TV, then other people know they're cool and want them in their movies and stuff.  Which sucks.  Unless you go to the movies.  Then it's better.  And hey, popcorn.  Seriously, we'll keep trying to get them back when stories work with them - and we'll see.<BR>
<BR>
And please - sweater, hat - don't make me choose.  You're both so intriguing.

<DD>  Will's really silly hat will be back, rest assured.  And I actually think you would have liked what we had in mind for the pop tart.  We were sad not to get her, because Joss came up with a cool idea.

<DD><yellow 1295>  Hey.  Just lurking.  I never get a chance to drop by anymore.  Britney will NOT appear on BTVS as once planned - she's too busy right now.  Also - thanks Angela for your christmas card.  I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to reply.  It was a crazy time.  Hope you're well and that we'll get to say hi at the posting board party.  Are there two this year?  When are they?  What's the deal with the new, two party system?
