<dd>Bbob:  Plenty of wit there, my friend.  You’re Santa’s good list now.<br><br>Lester “Creep” Crawley:  You ain’t kidding.  I just want to be free to ride my machine without being hassled by the man.  Is that too much to ask for?<br><br>The Partyman:  Thanks buddy.  And yes – my middle name is now “fun and lighthearted.” No, wait, that’s Drew.   I’m always getting us confused.<br><br>Abt:  Yes, strangely I got ep. 13 last year too.  <br><br>Megdalen:  I like seeing green too.  Could you spare a twenty till payday?<br><br>Allyson:  Nope.  I’m keeping it in a jar on my desk.  I love the way it pulsates when it’s agitated.<br><br>Tiggy:  I’lle you tonight.  Poke me if I forget.  Haven’t seen my ep. Cut together yet, but I loved what I saw down on the set.<br><br>CYMru:  Having a problem coming up with a five-letter word that fits your description.  But I trust it’s appropriately disturbing.<br><br><br>And that’s all the Steve that’s fit to print.  I’ll try to stop back in next Friday.   Love you all like – well, you know how much.<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Cashmere!:  Spoliers are bad!  Have you learned nothing?!  Two weeks in the hospital, sucka!  POW!<br><br>Abt:  Yeah.  Most of the time when fans start complaining about something, we just shrug it off ‘cause we know we’re planning on explaining things down the road.  In many ways, each season of Buffy is one big episode.  Some people just can’t wait for act three.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  I’m doing much better now that you’re here.  How are things in Deutschland?   A wee chilly?<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Can’t wait to see the pics.  You frighten me – and I LOVE a good scare.<br><br>Tiggy:  It’s all clear to me now.  I thought it meant Middle Earth.  Speaking of which, if you all haven’t seen Lord of the Rings yet – what are you waiting for?  It’s amazing.  Can’t believe such a beautiful film cost less than 100 mil.  Hats off to Peter Jackson.<br><br>Elizabethdarcy:  Now that’s a cool name.  And hey – you read my mind about LOTR.  No idea when the soundtrack for the BTVS musical will be out.  The suits have taken over, so I’m hoping it hits the stores by 2005.<br><br>The Partyman:  Where the hell’s my highball?  <br><br>Ergoshakes:  I’d ask to see them, but I don’t want John Law coming down on me.  Maybe a pic instead.  Aw crap.  I hear the feds knocking.<br><br>Snuzeggy:  Hi right back at you, chief.<br><br><br>Okay, one more round then I gotta fly to see Ali.<br><br>

<dd>Allyson:  Petrie’s always on a platter.  We can’t get him down.<br><br>Newt:  We just like the S-E-X over at B-T-V-S.  Shhh.  Don’t tell U-P-N.<br><br>abt:  Ask that Vespucci fellow.  He probably has a nifty answer.<br><br>Spikeme:  Chicago?  Let me know the one day it’s not too hot or too cold and I’ll swing by.<br><br>Tiggy3233:  Hello, sunshine.  Yes, e received.  I’m of two minds on the subject.  I’ll get back to you soon.<br><br>Ergoshakes:  In my best James Earl Jones:  “Sister!  You were wise to hide her from me.”<br><br>Single Malt:  Keep drinking there, punchy.  I’ll knit you two weeks in the hospital, sucka!  Whoops, sorry.  My street creds fell out.<br><br>Huggybuff.:  Thanks.  I’d love to swing by Sacramento, but John Law has it out for me there.  Don’t ask.<br><br>

<dd>Abt: You’re too kind.  If you liked that, my next episode’ll kill ya.<br><br>Whim:  M.E.?  Spell it out for me, I’m a little slow before the first highball.<br><br>Old One:  We got a nice bottle of something or another.  I put it in the fridge next to the other network gifts.  When they fire me I’ll have a bender on their dime.<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  If this is true, send Tiggy a pic.  If it isn’t, make one, breathe life into it with your magicks, and put it to work writing my next ep.<br><br>Petrona:  Don’t know who’s writing the last ep yet.  All depends if Joss is busy shooting the pilot for Firefly.<br><br>Raithen: Send me a sweater.  It gets chilly at night.<br><br>Genrefan:  Joss isn’t big on time travel stories.  Really hard to come up with a new angle for those.  Plus Star Trek’s done them to death.  But we are considering a neat storyline where the holodeck malfunctions, creating a life-threatening situation for the scoobies.<br><br>

<dd>Ergoshakes:  What's shaking?  You, baby.  You. ;)<br><br>Newt:  My next manwich should air the first Tuesday in February.  It’ll be a real laugh riot.<br><br>Spikeme:  The cuckoo flies at midnight.<br><br>Intrigued:  My day goes swimmingly.  Off to see “Ali” soon.  Wanna see if he still beats Liston after all these years.<br><br>Leather Jacket:  What’s that about my shoulders?  Let me tell you – they’re massive.  Like a couple of cantaloupes trolling for trouble.  Ka-pow!  Ka-pow!<br><br>Genevieve’s Lucie:  Gone is amazing.  Yeah Big Daddy Fury.<br><br>The Stage:  Mmm.  Spanky pants.<br><br>

<dd>Miko:  Vamp Willow already has her own show.  It plays in my head every night.  Yikes!  I've revealed too much!  Look away!  Look away!<br><br>

<dd>Lilyana:  Yeah, yeah.  I suck.  Tell me something I don't know.  This year I'll try to keep my Friday visits more regular.  Time permitting, of course.  It's a lot of work gearing up to kill Xan - uh, I mean my knitting lessons are taking up a lot of my free time.  Knitting, yeah, that's it.<br><br>
