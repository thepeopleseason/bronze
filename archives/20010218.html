<b>ED1_faith:</b>  Hey!  I was there all night...I was wearing a gold (extremely shiny) top...I'm surprised you missed me!  (Bummer!)  But yes, I had a very nice time, thanks.  I think everybody did!  =)<BR>
<BR>
OK, I am just an exhausted mess, so I'm gonna go.  Bye!<BR>

<DD><b>dog:</b>  Hi!  Yep, I plan on seeing you there!<BR>
<b>DeAn:</b>  LOL...good!  No more butt shots, please!<BR>
<b>Alaric:</b>  Yes, I see that.  That's cool, though, 'cause I really need to go to bed, anyway. (I have such a full day tomorrow!)<BR>
<b>Amberlynne:</b>  Hehehe...actually, I didn't even talk to him last night.  He was always swamped with people, you know?  I've talked to hime on a few occasions before, though.  He's cool.  But I've had no luck on getting him to join the band...yet.  ;-)

<DD><b>EviLSIT:</b> Hi, girlie!  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I had a four-hour rehearsal for Macbeth today, (which involoves fight choreography and singing and dance, in addition to acting), then I went out to dinner with a friend, and I just got home, and I have to work tomorrow, plus rehearse for the jazz gig I'm doing in Vegas, plus rehearsal for Macbeth again.  So I'm tired, too.  ;-)  great to see you last night...we'll see you at the Baked Potato gig in April!<BR>
<b>DeAn:</b>  Hey!  It was great meeting you last night.  And yeah, I remember about the opening slot for the UK tour.  hehehe<BR>
<b>Amberlynne:</b>  Hi there!  I hope someone grabbed a pen for you.  If not, I'll mail one to you, OK?  And yep, I had fun.
