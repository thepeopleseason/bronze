<DD>Pulp fiction? oh, right shoot em up, and you gots great emotional payoff... not. sorry sweetie but i think you just bought into the fad that was Tarrantino.  you know it's like nose rings, hip, then not.  bell buttoms, in and out.  tattoos, show or no show.  same same.<BR>
I agree with the Truman show statement.... was nicely shot, but didn't payoff. and if you haven't noticed i replaced your copy of "my best friends wedding" with the "best of jerry falwell."<BR>

<DD>Circe: it's like variety see... i'm watching the slow moving but great Godfather, but now i want some comedy, then some action, not another slow moving drama like Chinatown.... it's great i'll admit that... i'm just no drama fan.  I like sci fi/ fantasy, action, mystery, comedy, blood and guts. my life is too much of a drama itself, so for escape i want fantasy.
