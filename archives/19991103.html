<DD>Gotta fly.  <BR>
<BR>
I'll work on getting James, David and Nick to remove more clothing (though I, personally, feel my time would be better spent getting Charisma and Sarah into a teddy.  But what do I know?)<BR>
<BR>
Good day.

<DD>Alaric - Yes.  But I couldn't personally tell you when.  It should be any day now.<BR>
<BR>
Slay me - Frankly, none of them are hard to write (a testament to how vividly their voices were developed by Joss).  If I was forced to choose, I'd say Oz, since he's the most stoic.  You want to give hime more to say, but it's not right for Oz to be verbose.  Favorite character?  Probably Xander, since he's the most like me.

<DD> Narrator - Don't I get any points for putting Xander in a Speedo?

<DD> A word to all of you wringing your hands about certain characters and their mopiness, bufooneryness and loserness...<BR>
<BR>
Patience.  <BR>
<BR>
There are GREAT things in store for your beloved characters throughout this and next season.  Much surprises to satisfy the lot of you.  So, relax and enjoy.  <BR>
<BR>
You people worry too much.*g*
