<DD>the watcher - I'd like to try the idea of the producers hiring me a 90-piece orchestra.  Beyond that, I don't really plan ahead for the sounds & ideas in episodes I've not yet seen; I let watching the episode give me ideas.<BR>
<BR>
Theatergirl - I heard Tom went to Berlin or something.  Maybe that was a while ago?  No plans as of yet for a score album, but I'm working on it.<BR>
<BR>
Arsinoe - postproduction can be finished as late as the day before airing.  But typically it's a couple of weeks.  I think they're filming 11 now, which probably doesn't air until well into the new year.<BR>
<BR>
OK and bye!

<DD>second to last post...<BR>
<BR>
Blackheart - Not usually.  There is typically a 2-3 week period in between my final delivery of the score and airing.  When things get tight, though, it gets a little hairy.  I don't deliver the xmas episode until 6 days before it airs, for example.<BR>
<BR>
RyanH - addy above, but lookin for spoilers is gonna get you nowhere.<BR>
<BR>
noni - It's not joyful to know spoilers.  In fact it's a curse.  I'm terrible with secrets.  And I usually get 6-7 days to do each show.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - don't know about J or F, but the huge Z makes a stunning return!

<DD>Maverick - I actually never saw Days of Heaven - perhaps I should.<BR>
<BR>
Arsinoe - I have a subscription to the LA phil.  We probably don't go to the same concerts because I unfortunately do not share your fondness for Sibelius...<BR>
<BR>
Squiggy - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Theatergirl - I went to Yale undergrad.  And BONGG Tom Schauber was in all my classes.  Though he preferred the pseudonym "Tom Sacks" when he wrote film music.  I guess he didn't want to tarnish his pristinge academic reputation :)  The other guy in my class you might know is Doug Garrett.

<DD>Kara, you are forgiven.  No, it wasn't Seth.  It was George Doering, a studio guitarist here in L.A.  I heard Seth can play a little guitar, though...<BR>
<BR>
RyanH - Darlene, Buffy's blonde boss from the diner in <u>Anne</u>, does not make an appearance in <u>The Wish</u>.  Sorry to dissapoint you.<BR>
<BR>
the watcher - I've been composing in one form or another since I was 11 or so.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - thanks.  I do indeed love ep 9.  Though it does not top 8 for me, or 10 for that matter.  <BR>
<BR>
Aurorastar - thanks.  You should have heard my first version - sweeping, orhestral, and grand - in fact it was all a little <u>too</u> big.  The smaller, intimate piece that's in there now works much better.  (credit Joss for that)<BR>
<BR>
PhilPhud - Wasn't me and I don't know who picked the Cream song.  I agree it was perfect.  Probably one of the editors?<BR>
<BR>
Arsinoe - I've heard Seth is fair to middling on guitar, from a very reliable source.

<DD>AngleMan: The score is definitely different.  I used some new sounds & textures for the show, to mirror the warpedness of the Wish universe.  Parts of the score sound more like X-Files (with thanks to Mark Snow) than Buffy.  And the last scene is definitely off the beaten Buffy path.<BR>
<BR>
RJ - Thanks<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - thank your brother for me<BR>
<BR>
aurorastar, Mike-ff: hey there<BR>
<BR>
Arsinoe - I've never received a better compliment.

<DD>Sarah W. - I'd like to look at Medusa and turn to stone.<BR>
<BR>
Hey madrigal aka theatergirl - ya, I got the letter.  It was very cool to receive.  And it wasn't at all cheesy.<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel - When I was a kid, the first record I remember getting really into was some Elvis record.  Then I was the world's biggest <i>Styx</i> fan.  For Buffy music I guess Stravisnky, Bernard Herrman, Jerry Goldsmith.  I didn't really pay attention (oddly enough) to film or TV music until I started trying to do it myself.<BR>
<BR>
And I will most likely be at the PBP.<BR>
<BR>
Hey there fax1.<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - The air schedule was determined well before ep 10 was delayed.  There was extra time available so they took it.<BR>
<BR>
noni - thanks & hi<BR>
<BR>
Angelus7 - Without getting specific - I believe the xmas eppy was delayed because a scene needed to be recut on WB's request.

<DD>Hey Bronzers.  Just finished "The Wish" and now I get a short break.  (Xmas eppy delayed by a week...)<BR>
<BR>
Turkey was good.
