<DD>I really should be going...<BR>

<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hmmm...I can only surmise he is embarrasd by his costume.  The scene we shot was the final scene of the video - basically the band playing a gig on a spaceship.  Everyone was pretty wacky looking.  We're planning on providing a free copy of the video to all the particiapnts, but it will not be finished for a long time yet.<BR>
<b>Yooper:</b>  I would assume he means because of ownership and royalty issues.  Perhaps the WB or Fox Music owns the rights to the theme.  Also, I know that it was co-written with someone who is not a member of the band, so perhaps that plays into it as well.  But I am only guessing.<BR>
<b>Eirinn:</b>  Hehehe...thanks!  =)<BR>
<b>newt:</b>  No money for a European tour, unfortunately.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>cabin7dad:</b>Responded to you on the TPB, but typed your name totally incorrectly, like the moron I am.  Sorry!  And you're welcome.<BR>
<b>Aethelaf:</b>  Too true.<BR>
<b>Luv2Bbit:</b>  Oh, I totally remember you!  How are ya?<BR>
<b>BlackSheep:</b>  We formed in 1994, with Jeff Stacy and me as the main members.  The current band line-up has been with us just over a year.  High school was interesting...I was always a bit on the outside.  Kind of a freak, but not quite.  I was respected for my talent, but ridiculed for my uncontrolled creative outbursts.  (I was quite a spaz, I must say...)  Anyway, I was never in a rock band before Velvet Chain, but I've been a singer all my life, as well as an actress, and I had my first paid recording gig at age 11.

<DD><b>Spike 14</b>  Thank you!  =)  We would <i>love</i> to go on the show again, but there are no plans for that to happen as of yet.  But you never know...<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Yep, I'm looking forward to it, too!  Just remember:  I'm not the best conversationalist <i>before</i> I sing, mainly for voice-preservation reasons.  You know how it is.  But I'm planning on partying afterwards!  =)<BR>
<b>Jeanie TTF:</b>  Hey, hi!  Nice to see you, and thanks.<BR>
<b>LilBuf Buf:</b>  I know!  I just left NJ yesterday evening, in the middle of the snowstorm.  (Gotta love having to wait while your plane is de-iced...)  It was glacial the whole time I was home.  Now that I'm gone, I'm sure it'll warm up.  =)</SMALL>

<DD>Thanks, <b>newt!</b>  =)  Nice to meet you.<BR>
<b>SarahNicole:</b>  I'm not sure...how long ago?  Send it again, why don't you?<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  What do you mean?  We shot some scenes for the video for "Beyond Time" just before I left for NJ with some very cool fans who volunteered to be extras...is that what you mean?

<b>FSM CDMan:</b>  Cool!  I'll look forward to seeing you there!<BR>
<b>Raelynn aka Willow</b>:  Hi!  I'm fine, thanks.  Well-rested for once...which I'm sure will be a very short-lived feeling.  hehe<BR>
<b>Destiny:</b>  Yeah, you maight as well wait the extra couple of weeks.  ;-)  Should be a blast!<BR>

<DD><b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Hi, there!  yeah, we're playing 45 minute sets...but we are FULLY capable of doing Diva that entire time, as I'm sure you're aware.  LOL!  Can't wait for Feb!<BR>
<b>Buggo:</b>  Hi!  I'm good, thanks.  I'll stop by your site shortly!<BR>
<b>KAT in the dark:</b>  Howdy!  You know what?  I <i>did</i> get the e-mail, but the word search wouldn't open for me!  If you want to send me a URL instead, I'll print it from there!  Thanks for the good-vibes for the performance tonight.  I will endeavor to rock the house mightily!

<DD><b>FSM CDMan:</b>  Hey, there!  You gonna make it to the show tonight?  I just got back from NJ, so I'm pretty tired, but I'm resting up and looking forward to singing tonight.  (Seems like a great way to end my vacation before I have to go back to retail hell....)
