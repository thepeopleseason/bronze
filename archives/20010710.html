<DD> Hey everybody ... So hard to leave on this, the "last" day.  All the big love from the Bronzers, it's like a drug.  Only legal.  And good for you.  So I guess it's more like a puppy in that regard.  And it doesn't pee on the furniture.  So, there: Bronze Love is BETTER than a puppy.  Dig that.  AjO, hope you're feeling better.  And did I mention Crazy Joss Whedon's letting me direct an episode this season?  Amazing what a guy'll do for you when you get him good 'n likkered up.  Fabulous Jane Espenson's writing it now.  Now, as we speak.  Spooky.  And Fury's directing too.  And Marti'll return to the director's chair later in the season.  So dig it: Season Six: "The Lunatics Run the Asylum."  BIG LOVE ... Doug.

Also, we thought you should know that Doug Petrie is NOT a poopyhead, no matter what Rebecca says.  For the love of GOD, Steve, put your pants back on.

<DD> Hey Bronzers!  It's Doug Petrie, here to say don't worry that WB corporate weasels are pulling the plug - it ain't over until WE decide it is!  Angel died once, and look how well his hair holds up - smooth, gelled, I'd kill for hair like that.  Buffy died, and she's ... well she's dead.  Game over, man.  Gee.  This isn't as turning out as reassuringly as I originally intended.  Huh.  I kind of suck.  But ... big LOVE and PROPS to all bronzers.  We'll see you all again real soon!  Promise.

(I'm so ashamed.)<BR>
<BR>
Willow's gimp - Thanks a lot. Glad you liked FI.  And the chicken comes before the egg.<BR>
<BR>
I mean, it depends.  In that case, once we knew it was an ep about fear, the metaphor became clear and infused the story.  But we come at every ep. differently.  <BR>
<BR>
Okay, Cosmic Bob's right.  (And congrats to you, btw, on the little one.)  I do have to get back to work on nekkid Darla.  <BR>

So, take care, all of you.  See you on the other side.<BR>

What?<BR>
<BR>
Oh, have they?<BR>

I see.<BR>
<BR>
Well, anyhow, buck up, friends.  Like our move to UPN, things will be exactly the same as they've always been, just have to punch in a different web address, that's all.<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure the new address will have more floor space, a couple more bathrooms, on a big lot with room enough for a pool and guest house.<BR>
<BR>
Just think of the housewarming party we'll have over there.<BR>
<BR>

<SMALL>(Tue Jul 10 12:15:07 2001 216.186.192.200)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>back in the fall of 1997, i harbored a dirty little secret:  i was addicted to this show called (of all the humiliating things) "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".  i struggled valiantly to repress my deep-seated need to analyze, adore, and deconstruct every episode in its minutiae, but alas, i was just as hooked as your average crack ho.  luckily, my dealer had this on-line shop where i could (for the relatively small price of eye-strain and carpal-tunnel) indulge my soul-quaking lust with impunity -- moreover, i could bond with other addicts across the globe.  and now...<BR>
<BR>
well, you know the story.  i've gone from passive crack ho to dealing the stuff myself -- a journey that has had its ups and downs, its twists and turns, but ultimately was so rewarding and worthy that the aches and pains seem to POOF right into dustage.  i'll always remember The Bronze as my starting place, my own personal Genesis <small>[sans Phil Collins]</small>, the Big Bang that created my universe as i know it today, and to even contemplate that it could've happened otherwise is to stare into the Hellmouth itself.<BR>
<BR>
i know there will be another Bronze, somewhere, sometime -- and yet, my heart belongs to the original.  i will always consider <i>this</i> Bronze to be my first home, and though i might move away, dye my hair a freaky shade of purple, join a commune, get a job as an investment banker, or any of the other wacky things people do when they grow up, i know that i've come from a good place.  a loving, supportive place.  and i will always be thankful.<BR>
<BR>
i was, am, and always will be...<BR>

<DD> I just spent the last weekend moving to a new apartment.  As we all know, moving is just one giant pain in the ass.  But now that I'm in my new place and settling in, things are much like they were before.  I bet it'll be much the same with the New Bronze, wherever it ends up being.  Remember: it's not the building that makes the home.  It's the people in the building that makes a home.  I'll look forward to your new place and will remain grateful that I got in on the tail-end of the Bronze Mark I Era.  Let me know where the new digs are and I'll be sure to stop by.  (Hopefully, I'll even have an episode to discuss by then!)  Thanks again for all the generous support and we'll talk again soon!  Can't wait to see your new place!

<DD>  Howdy.  Dru had such a strong arc on Angel last year, it didn't quite fit to have her show up in Buffy-land, or so we thought at the time.  And, I've never heard that Steven King is a big Buffy fan, although we certainly admire his stuff and talk about it often.  Pet Semetary (sp?) is one of my favorites, as is Thinner.  The Shining, or course.  And then there's Carrie, and Christine and...  Oh my God, he's cool.<BR>

Tiggy:  Hugs and tissues all around.  Look forward to your e as always.  And hey you Bronzers, don't forget to send Tiggy your pics for the DeKnight sister site.  I need a full record for the police when the stalking starts up.<BR>
<BR>
Willow's Poker Face:  Only one person on the Buffy writing staff smokes.  Rest of us don't care for it.  But Spike is at his core evilly vampire guy, and he smokes evil cigs.  Don't see that changing anytime soon.<BR>

Uhp!  Gotta fly.  Somebody's gotta write those scripts.  I'll catch you guys in the next incarnation of the mighty Bronze.<BR>

<DD>Oz Lady  - Really?  It's the middle of the night here in LA.  I got in late and heard the news about the "real" Bronze going down, so I just had to pop in on its last night up.  The PR folks really did a great thing when they put this up.  I have to say that the WB's constant drive to make people take BUFFY seriously as a show (in spite of its name) is really one of the number one things that helped it to succeed.<BR>
<BR>
Meteor  -  Yeah.  I recall that too.  I even brought over some of the Power Ranger fans that had grown too old for that show over to BUFFY and the PB.  Believe me, I got a lot of the same kind of flack at work for going to the PB to chat as some of you did.  And those were the people who were making BUFFY!

<BR>
Villa  -  It was in a classroom on a blackboard behind Willow's head.  I think it was one of the Zombie episodes from second season.  I know that David Greenwalt was directing it.<BR>
<BR>
I did put the letters "PB" on a blackboard once on Sheena and also had it carved on the side of a wood crate during a fight in which Sheena smashes my own face through it.  I shot it both fast and slow.  You could read it in slo-mo, but I liked the fast version better so we went with that one.  Maybe I'll do it again sometime and I'll let everyone know it's coming.  Just for the heck of it.

<DD>Meteor - That would be cool.  Yeah.  I remember how it was.  The first PBP was just going to be a small gathering of some of us from the board.  Only Todd and myself planned on actually going out to meet the Bronzers.  Then I started trying to talk to the actors and other crew members about it and when RD talked to publicity that's when it turned into a gimmick for the show and sort of got out of hand a little.  But it was a great way to make a lot of people happy (by getting the actors to show up for the official publicity outing) and it was good for the show.  I'll never forget the shocked expressions on mine and Joss' faces that first time.  That was when we knew the show was taking off at last.

<DD>AKA Becker - Yep.  That is exactly the show that I mentioned to you over a year ago.  I wound up getting everything I wanted - including full-time DGA pay on top of the stunt coordinating pay and my own action unit with two cameras.  I was sitting on the fence about doing it and then all that mess happened at BUFFY and the choice was made.  <BR>
<BR>
It all has turned out to be the best thing that could have happened for me.  I always have to get pushed into making a next step or else I'll just keep working like a slave for someone.   Joss was right when he said, "on to loftier things."  That's just how it's worked out;)

<DD>Meteor - Good to see you again on this final night of Bronzing.<BR>
<BR>
Tiamat - I love the NW.  Hope I get to shoot up there sometime too.  <BR>
<BR>
Lexdra - Hey thanks.  Even though Sheena doesn't do Martial arts per se, I did an episode recently (all these will air after September) that has Martial arts in it.  Now one of the producers has asked me to shoot a pilot presentation for a new series about a female Martial arts expert who is some kind of spy.  Who knows?  If that pans out maybe I'll get to do some more Buffy-like stuff with Sophia.

<DD>Roman Around - Yep.  Because he's the only director I've ever seen who keeps trying to give stunt people credit for his own success.   He's really secure about himself and what he does and very grateful to the stunt community.  I'd give him the shirt off my back any day.  He really tries hard.

<DD>Villa - Sorry.  I have been unable to watch this past season due to the hectic work schedule.  I think I only saw a couple of them---Now all the prior ones I could probably help you with.  <BR>
<BR>
All I know is that it usually goes like this:  1) There's a BIG evil coming at the end of the season that will destroy life as we know it.<BR>
<BR>
2)  Someone will fall in love with someone who won't love them back.<BR>
<BR>
3)  And the sit-com jokes will be peppered throughout.<BR>
<BR>
4)  There should also be lots of beat-up time and hopefully a few direct lifts of scenes from successful movies.<BR>
<BR>
That sort of sums up every season I know about.  And in the end Buffy will either die or walk off in the sunset alone and her friends will worry much and say words with "-age) tacked onto the end of them.<BR>
<BR>
There ya go.  Wrapped in a bow ;p

<DD>Roman Around  -  You know what?  I think I'd get a kick out of going back in time and doing a fight with Bruce on "Enter the Dragon."  That'd do me.

<DD>St George - Yeah.  When I first started showing up here it was just me, Todd, Ty and sometimes Marti.  Joss was afraid that nobody would be in here at first, so we kinda hung out and stirred things up a bit.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Just as I once put a SO to the PB on a black board on BUFFY, I did the same thing on SHEENA one day.  Just for the heck of it.  But it's during a fight scene, so it goes by too fast to really see.  Hey, it's the thought that counts - right?

<DD>thanks Tiamat.<BR>
<BR>
Whoa.  Look... there's Demorial and NuPhalanx and Zeus and Bruce's Mom and Mrs. Pointy...<BR>
I had heard that none of the old  timers still showed up here.  Yet... there they are.  Good to see you all.<BR>
<BR>
Xana - That movie Sophia was in will be out next month.  Van Damme went to a screening of it and asked her to be in his next flick.  It's silly, but good fights in it.  She also has been stunt doubling everone under the sun (even Madonna for that BMW thing).  She also co-starred on a SHEENA ep too.<BR>
<BR>
For some reason SHEENA has been doing well without any marketing at all, so the studio has ordered two more seasons to be shot back-to-back.  They are just trying to sqeeze out as many as they can.  Starting in October they have ordered another 35.  I hate to be away from home for so long, but the money is just too huge for me to turn down.

<DD>Big sister corina:   I guess you can't.  Especially since I have a new email addy now.  (Man!  And I just got on the fast broadband cable for ultra-mouthy online chatter too)  ;)

<DD>Xana:  I was there for the rehearsal (and put together that little fight while I was there).  They wanted me to stay and do a fight with Sophia myself, but I had to get back to work.  I was only in Key West for a few hours just to see my girl.<BR>
<BR>
Thumper:  Well... The producers of the Scooby Doo Movie called us.  They asked if we would sneak Sophia down under and have her do a kung fu wire fight for Sarah.  That may be where that rumor started.  Sophia wouldn't do it unless youu-know-who was going to be nice about it.  So.... she stayed in the USA stunt doubled another slayer instead (Eliza in JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK).

<DD>gazoo:  I just got back online after being away in Orlando for the past year shooting two seasons worth of shows back to back for SHEENA.  As soon as I get back online the very first thing I hear is that the old Bronze in no more.  Man!  Sophia started BUFFY in '96 and I followed her shortly after and went on the Bronze almost right away.  It's hard to believe this thing has gone on for this long.  Oh well.  It was fun.

<DD>Large shout to my old friend Motorcycle au pair boy (and everyone else too)<BR>
<BR>
I just got back into town and now I hear that this is the end for the ol' Bronze.  Wow.  Seems like only yesterday.
