<dd><b>halfrek:</b>  Well, thank you!  I really appreciate that.<br><b>Mrs. Pointy:</b>  I know!  It's been <i>ages</i>!  Well, things have been going remarkably well.  The upcoming Velvet Chain album is coming together really amazingly - I mean, it's probably the coolest thing we've ever done.  I've been acting a lot.  Mostly in musicals.  I've discovered I can make money doing that, instead of having to sell clothes at Bloomingdale's. Sooooo, I've been "day-job-free" since November.  I'm currently in rehearsals for a musical called "Nine," in which I play the female lead, Luisa.  That opens next week.  It doesn't pay (well, I get a stipend if I can get a certain amount of people to the show), but I was doing it in order to get more leads on my resume.  (Most of the paid work I was doing were supporting roles in bigger musicals.)  Then, about a week ago, I found out I was cast as Maria in "the Sound of Music" in one of the bigger houses out here, and I'm going to be joining Equity in order to do the role.  (In case you're unfamiliar, Equity is the acting union for live theater.)  I'd been avoiding joining (even though I could, through SAG), because I wasn't sure I had the credits to back it up. You know, would I be able to beat out other Equity actors for leads.  Well, I guess I can, because I did.  =)  So, from now on, I'm in with the big boys.  hehehe<br><b>Miko:</b>  LOL!<br><b>Oblivia:</b>  Why, thank you!  Part of that was my toning it down for the camera - they didn't want me to upstage anybody - but you're right...I am definitely a much different performer than I was 6 years ago!  I thank you very much for noticing, and yay that you want a VC VD!  =)  Just go to our website if you want any stuff!<br><b>Old One:</b>  hey!  So nice to see you, and thanks!<br><br>Wow...I really should get going....<br><br>

<dd><b>Squirrel:</b>  *blush*  Thank you!  And I'm glad everybody's doing OK.  =)<br><b>Miko:</b>  Hello!  Well, there's always a chance, but it all comes down to money.  Of which we have none.  hehehe  So, if it were a deal similar to Creepcon, where our travel expenses were taken care of, then yes, we would definitely come to Pittsburgh!  But unless something like that pops up, it'll probably be at least another 6 months to a year before we can tour the country and end up over on the East coast.<br><b>Freaking Amazing Witch:</b>  Well, sorry to hear that, but everybody has to deal with winter sometime, right?  You'll be fine.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>halfrek:</b>  Oh, that's great!  I'm so glad you're happy with the CD choice.  And thanks so much for spreading the word about us!  You rock!  And it was a really fun weekend for us, too. Yay!<br><b>Freaking Amazing Witch:</b>  Well, I'm fine, too. I was fighting a cold, but I seem to be winning.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>EverDawn:</b>  Hi, there!  No, I haven't seen her post, but she did e-mail to let me know she was going to do it.  She's the BEST!  =)  Sorry you can't make it, but thanks for the vibes, and I'm glad you enoyed me on WBSM!  ;-)<br><br>
