<DD>M.W. - to call the size of group I work with on Buffy an "ensemble" would be a gross overstatement.  I use samplers to create most of the score, and I sweeten these with two or three players (who come in to my studio one at a time, I might add, lest anyone be thinking "trio").

<DD>Gates - Well, actually, I *did* send off CD after CD.  For me, USC was more of a kick start in my interest in pursuing composing.  The people who hire composers don't really care about degrees...<BR>
<BR>
AngleMan - If Joss kills me dead it's your fault OK?  The titles are...<BR>
ep#5 - "Homecoming"<BR>
ep#6 - "Band Candy"<BR>
ep#7 - "This one is actually the slightest bit descriptive so I don't think I'm telling"<BR>
<BR>
Addict no. 1 - thanks.  Passion is one of my faves too.

<DD>Hey RD.  So it looks like VIPs come up in white when I post in blue.  Hmmm.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - No, "picture locked" means the editors' work is finished.  At that point, the music, and sound work (including foley) begins.  This usually occurs during the week or so before the final mix.

<DD>Angle Man - Sorry can't give plot spoilers.  But the music has some violins in it!  Oh, and re: putting me in the next edition of the <i>Watcher's Guide</i>, well I should think so!  As compensation for zero mentions this year I want a cover photo on next years, along with a posessory credit (is that what they call it?) - e.g. <i>Chris Beck IS the Watcher's Guide</i>.<BR>
<BR>
M.W. - At one point the production guys were sending me scripts every week, and I asked them to stop because I was never reading them.  So much is dictated by the shooting and editing of a scene - pacing, nuances in performance, atmosphere - that is not evident in the script, it wouldn't be terribly productive to do too much work from a script.  Besides which I'm incredibly lazy, and anything I can put off until next week, I will.<BR>
<BR>
Re: ep 8, my deadlines coincide with the start of the final mix of the show, where they mix together the music, dialogue, and all the sound FX.  This happens typically two weeks before air.  And re: starting on ep 8 now, see above re: laziness.

<DD>WOW.  An embarrassment of Calvin-Ball-explaining riches - I guess I spoke too soon in my last post.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - I work from a finished (what they call "picture-locked") version of the show.  The music is very tightly timed to the visual so I wouldn't be very productive to score a script, or an unfinished cut.<BR>
<BR>
Gates - There's a longer answer to this, of course, but here it is: I came to L.A. to do the USC Film Scoring Program (a one year graduate music program) more or less on a lark (I had been set to get a Master's composing "serious music").  I found out a) I liked it and b) I seemed to be good at it, so I stuck around.  My first job was ghostwriting for a little-known low-budget kids' show, and everything else progressed from there...

<DD>Cosmic Bob - Not working.  Not going to Vegas either, tho...<BR>
belmont- I'll just watch the game for now.  I bruise easily.  (Assuming the game is the still-unexplained-to-me Calvin Ball))</SMALL>

<DD>AngleMan - Just finished ep 7 and now I'm actually getting a week off from Buffy.  So no work, and no wife (she's in Taiwan) - to the Posing Board, I say! ...  But otherwise your "avoiding work" guess would be right on the money.  Nothing is as fun as procrastination!
