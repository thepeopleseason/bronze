<dd><b>Amarra</b>: totally kosher.  just means you'll be enjoying first-runs when everyone in the states is screaming about repeats...<br><br><b>Cashmere</b>: listen to me very carefully, 'cause i'm only gonna say this once:<br><br><center><h1><b>STOP. READING. SPOILERS.<br>STOP THAT.<br>I MEAN IT.</b></h1></center><br><br>trust me.  i beg of you.  it'll be worth it.<br><br><b>Holden</b>: of course i remember, you dope. you'll always be <b>Holden</b> to me... <small> just to clarify: not that you'll always be "beholden" to me. just that you'll always BE... never mind.</small><br><br><b>Mar</b>: not sure of the skedooly at the mo', lotta shootin' and writin' coming up -- but thanks for the invite!  and i hereby dub your fifth: <b>Orpheus</b>.  this will make sense later.<br><br><b>Jaan Quidam</b>: for the love of god will you PLEASE tell me how to pronounce your name?  i've <i>always</i> wanted to ask.<br><br><b>abt</b>: it's okay that you didn't like Manny.  he was sorta s'posed to be annoying. annoyingly <i>endearing</i>, but hey, maybe i'll get it next time.<br><br><b>Bullseye</b>: i'll definitely be at the PBP -- though glam poses have never been my forte. glum poses, sure.  even glad poses.  but glam? notsomuch.<br><br><b>princessfantastico</b>: don't worry about it. i can never spell "judgement". or "judgment". or however the hell you spell it. and i think "geniusie" is a great word. <small>especially when you apply it to ME! ME ME ME!</small><br><br>i need my Thorazine.  where's <b>Muffy</b>?<br><br><b>The Great One</b>: nice to meet you, too. so technically, really, who IS the Great One these days? is it still Jackie Gleason? <small>and why am i so old?</small><br><br><b>greeneyes</b>: i have NO idea what i'm gonna wear.  with my work schedule lately, my dress is gonna end up being constructed of McDonald's bags and some duct tape.<br><br><b>Nikka</b>: um, well... whattaya want? i don't have anything of value, and if i sign anything, it'll just depreciate... but hey! i could forge Joss's autograph!<br><br><b>Tamz</b>: i think you're right. there <i>should</i> be a bitty <b>tralf</b>.  <br><br><b>tralf</b>! make a bitty you!<br><br><b>DeM</b>: no shock, no?<br><br><b>Dunlin</b>: thanks! i was a long time on the net sorting out the Egyptian mythology stuff. made up two of the names, but used the rest pretty much accurately.  i always like lacing "real" mythology <small>(there's an oxymoron)</small> with imaginary. gives it a flavor of authenticity.<br><br><br><b>KAM</b>: the Beast knocking on the door... i just thought it was funny. <br><br>okay, folks.  gotta jet or i'm gonna be lost in the notes session.  <br><br><small>smoochy pie hi's to fen, jen, cyn, aaron, and bookster!</small><br>-mere-<br>sigJTT<br><br>
