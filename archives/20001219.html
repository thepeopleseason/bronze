<DD>>>Can you give us some minutely spoilerish, maddeningly vague hints as to where Angel's retreat into the darkness is going to lead?<<<BR>
<BR>
Nick, we were thinking... well... into darkness, really.

<DD>>>As I recall, he told that demon to "Take them all." He said more less the same thing to Drusilla and Darla just now. Time is a circle, and history repeats. Or does it?<<<BR>
<BR>
I don't know about history, but writers sure do repeat.

<DD>Well I don't know the new code these days, so while there will be doubts to my identity, trust me on this one...esp since it is my one and only post.  <BR>
I must say that although there were times I didn't have many of you as fans, and for the most part still don't :), I do want to say thanks.  The show was such a wonderful experience for me--both as a person and actor.  The cast and crew are among the best in the business, and I am proud to say that I left with many new friends.  And while it took a while to really find Riley, for both myself and the writers, I love where the character ended.  I have only read a few posts, but agree that tonight was one of the best of all time, which thrills me of course.  It was sad leaving the show, and oddly enough, I find it sad typing this.  It started as such an overwhelming experience, coming here to the bronze--esp given how I wasn't a crowd favorite.  But as time wore on, I realized how much I enjoyed every aspect of it.  It made my experience that much more special and unique--what other show has this kind of foloowing and commitment?  OK this is getting way too long...the point being this...you all have truly made this one of the most memorable experiences of my life--thank you.  I'd say enjoy the rest of the year--but I know you will.  Have a great holiday...my best,<BR>
