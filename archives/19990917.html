<DD>Blackheart -- well done.  That's the first sensible argument I've heard against gun control.  Ever.  However, even conceding the point, I can't imagine why we'd need automatic weapons of any sort, or why anyone would complain of a background check before being allowed to purchase a gun.  I still feel they should all be outlawed, but I can certainly appreciate your very intelligent position.

<BR>
Polgara -- Huh?  Where?<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius -- going great, thanks.  You?<BR>

<DD>Strawberries -- guess I missed a few, sorry about that.  Y'know, I seem to recall at some point, either in a script or on the show, Angel was referred to as the scourge of Europe.  I don't remember more than that, I'm sorry to say.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus, if you're still there, the Monster Book is exactly that, all the monsters from the show, conversations with the writers and producers on their inspirations, and then lengthy folklore and pop culture histories of the archetypes for those monsters.

<DD>This should be interesting.  I've never gotten up on a soapbox before.<BR>
<BR>
Sinclair & M. Ganfield -- Guns are not the root of the problems in our society, that's true.  We must raise our children to be better and more responsible people and parents.  We all must take that responsibility.  That said, however . . . unless you are in the military or on the police force, you do not need a gun.  The right to bear arms was invented in a time when having a firearm was a necessity in this country.  That is no longer true.  I'm not here to start a conversation, a debate or an argument, merely to state my firm opinion -- without guns, so many people who have been killed just this year, at Columbine, in Atlanta, at that church this week, would still be alive today.<BR>
<BR>
yes, people kill people . . . with guns.

<DD>'stina -- always!<BR>
<BR>
Loki -- soon, I hope.  I'll keep you posted.<BR>
<BR>
Chi -- David's too big a guy to play Cyclops, I think.  Anyway, James Marsden got the role.

thanks to KENDRA, ELUSIO and KRISTEN.<BR>
<BR>
Ripley -- wrong Chris.<BR>
<BR>
'stina -- I was for Angela Bassett, myself.<BR>
<BR>
Meteor -- no plans for New Zealand unless some convention brings me over or something.<BR>

POLGARA -- Hey!!!  Nah, just thought I'd spend an hour bein' sociable.

<DD>SarahNicole -- Okay, I REALLY wanted Russell Crowe for Wolverine, but ya can't win em all.<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic BOb -- Thanks, but sorry, no Minnesota signings.  Just New England and probably New York for now.<BR>
<BR>
Willa -- sigh.  Thanks so much.  It's very frustrating.  For instance, you don't want to hear about the nightmare of trying to get a signing in NYC now that B&N has pretty much forced all the little stores out.

<BR>
Corvus -- hey.  Well, actually, scheduling conflicts have forced me to drop out of the WG2.  Nancy's doing that one for next fall.  Meanwhile, I'm doing BtVS: the Monster Book for next year also.

<BR>
St. G. -- aarghh.  Although I have to say, that guy isn't the rep for Strangewood.  Still, though, he should've been pushing Body of Evidence also.  Sigh.

<DD>SarahNicole -- don't just the x-film so quickly.  GREAT director.  Script polish by Joss.  Patrick Stewart.  And I don't mind Halle or Dougray enough not to give them a chance.  Open minds.<BR>
<BR>
Cabin7man -- Can I add some philosophy to your list in your tag?  It's from RENT.  "The opposite of war isn't peace.  It's creation."<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

Angelgazer -- *blush* thanks.  I hope you like the new one, STRANGEWOOD, as much.<BR>
<BR>
Leather Jacket -- e-mail me through my site, www.christophergolden.com, if you want to talk about the book.<BR>
<BR>
Meteor -- thank you very much.<BR>
<BR>
Carita -- hey darlin'.  Where are you?  I have a TON of signings coming up from now through November.  And I agree about the comics.  I think we've all been much happier with the art of late.  And there's a lot more where that came from.
