Hello and thanks!  I've seen a lot of talk about us "going overboard" with the nazi "metaphor."  I'd say they were less metaphors and more, well, *nazis*, frankly.  They were there to dramatize Doyle's inner conflict, his own thematic conflict.  At least that's how I see it.  <BR>

My next ep is in fact Somnambulist and all I can tell you is that sometimes people have been known to do interesting and even horrible things in their sleep.  Even those who might sleep in the day.

I'm starting to get the feeling Harrison Emmet didn't like it.  Gee.
