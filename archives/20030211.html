<dd>Okay... gotta run away now!<br><br>For those attending the PBP --I will see you there!  In fact, I understand you can bid to have lunch with me!  And if you don't bid, I think they *force* you to have lunch with me!<br><br>

<dd>Princess of Darkness -- I don't think that's a dancing monkey -- I think it's supposed to be a picture of DeKnight -- the confusion is understandable.<br><br>

<dd>Denise --<br><br>My post to Sunburst was a joke -- Doug Petrie promised me all the money in hiw wallet if I'd do it -- then it turned out he only had $21.  So I learned my lesson.<br><br>

<dd>Okay.  I'm calm now.  Hello everyone!  Hope you enjoy the eppy tonight -- and, heads up -- there's another Espesode on it's way to you in just a couple weeks!<br><br>abt -- I certainly didn't think Dawn's paralysis would be upsetting to anyone.  Fact is, on our show, people are injured and affected in various ways -- Giles has been blind, Buffy has also been paralyzed, and Spike has a soul.  These have all been played for comic effect, and none were intended to give offense.  Especially in this case, since Dawn's paralysis was clearly portrayed as the result of demon fingernails, not traumatic insult to the spinal column.  If we were ever to give Dawn a permanent physical challenege, we would do it with sympathy, courage and realism.  This however, was Gnarl-caused posable-ness, and I decided I'd rather make America laugh than squirm with concern.  Because, you know, it's funnier that way and I'm a comedy writer!  Sincerely, I hope you weren't too upset.<br><br>Jane<br><br>

<dd>Hellloooo!<br><br>I think this is how you do spoilers, right?<br><br><br><br>Xander wasn't tied up over the seal yet when he texted Willow!  Because *obviously* he can't text her *after* he's tied, so, clearly, he must have done it *after* she betrayed her intent, and *before* he was tied!  Ergo... I would imagine that our observant viewers will realize that there must have been an appropriate moemnt -- for example, he regained consciousness in the back of her car and realized he was in trouble!!!.<br><br>!!!<br><br>
