OK... confused.  Either my brain is doing flips or a post of mine disappeared.<BR>
<BR>
Angus - if you're serious - I'd be happy to give you the name of one or two people who might be interested... but for zero dollars up front you may have some trouble.<BR>
<BR>
Ok buggo, just visited... count me in.<BR>

<DD>second-to-last post<BR>
<BR>
SpookyMagoo - I have an otiginal working vintage Space Invaders ****tail game in my studio.  (OK *mostly* working).  I run, among others, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, Frogger, Defender, Tron, Star Wars on my iMac every once in a while.  It would be hard to pick a favorite.<BR>
<BR>
Hehe.  I just remembered the reason I got Space Invaders was my wife Jane suggested it because she played it in Taiwan as a kid.  So when she sees it for the first time she says "that's not Space Invaders".  Turns out she was playing Galaxian, only they called it Space Invaders in Taiwan.  Either that or she was too embarrassed to admit she got the two mixed up.

<DD>Lady Wolfsbane - bas<i></i>ed on the rather surprising description of my music as "funky" I'm gonna guess your limb just broke.  I write all the (non-funky, at least to my ears) instrumental background music.  John King, music coordinator for the show, helps choose the songs, so I'll pass the thanks on to him.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie - Haven't heard it but I think it fell into the "cheesy for sure" compartment in my brain and it'll take accidental exposure to remove it.  Hope I didn't just unfairly trash you favorite record...<BR>
<BR>

<DD>longtimelurker - hey that was nice.  thanks<BR>
<BR>
thanks angus<BR>
<BR>
Matt - you can't put a price on making you wanna cry<BR>
<BR>
AjO - yes... but I ain't sayin more.<BR>
<BR>
buggo - but what if I can't stand Oz & Willow?<BR>
<BR>
hi Willow-<BR>
<BR>
amy_carella (OK, and Matt too) - currently only the Buffy soundtrack (one track only) and the soundtrack to "Guinevere" (five tracks) are available in stores.  There will likely be a score-only album sometime in the next few months.<BR>
<BR>
MAPB - I'll just hum along wordlessly<BR>
<BR>
buggo - OK I'll join your club.  I don't hate Oz & Willow really.

<DD>lurking b. - thanks.  I always think "OK now tell us what it was REALLY like" when I hear someone else say this sort of stuff -- Sarah was incredibly easy to work with and she was a pleasure to be around.  There's a wonderful quality to her voice, despite (or because of) her lack of training.  <BR>
<BR>
Beldin - the music from Earshot will not likely become available - sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Slave2Faith, AjO - hey<BR>
<BR>
Krysten - the only code that matters is the one in the "Your Name" field... and I already get too much credit.<BR>
<BR>
LW - Heya, and that was actually Robert Kral's music (see item re: credit above), but thanks, and I'll tell him
