<DD>OK rage, I'm willing to concede that it ultimately comes down to taste.  I guess I feel that that much virtuosity and time-signature-hopping can actually get in the way of my personal music-enjoying experience.  My problem is that you seem to equate virtuosity with talent.  It would have been one thing for you to come on the board last night and say "boy, those Bronze bands only play medium speed at fastest, and doesn't that suck".  It's quite another for you to proclaim a near-complete talent void.

<DD>rage - I understand what you're saying.  It just sounds like you're placing musicianship over creativity and I don't agree with that.  As more of a programmer/composer than a virtuoso musician myself, I'm certainly biased, but I would say truly satisfying music comes more from the soul than the fingers.<BR>
<BR>
Lisa - see below - I agree with you - and I <i>certainly</i> don't feel underappreciated.  Especially here.

<DD><b>rage:</b>  Well, know I have to eat a bit of crow, because I didn't read the posts myself, I only heard a rendition of it from a third party.  So, that's fine, and as I said before, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you'd listen to Treason (they used that song, albeit briefly, on the show) you'll notice that the musical arrangement and the chord progrssions are anything BUT "lowest-common-denominator."  It's such a bizarre song, musically - the chorus, in particular - that many "thory-heads" as I call them think it's an atrocity.  Oh, and i WISH we were more "pop" in a way...unfortunately, most of the labels we've encountered have said we're "exceptionally talented, but not commercial enough."  Ah, well.<BR>

Danne - On the contrary, I place a high value on that particular ramble.  In all seriousness, I agree with you that film music shouldn't call attention to itself.  And thanks for the kind words.<BR>
<BR>
drdan - I compose the background music.  Like what you hear when Buffy's in a big fight, or in a love scene.

Well, I won't bother trying to defend myself, as everyone's taste in music is different, <b>rage,</b> but Cibo Matto, Nerf Herder, Sarah McLachlan, et al have had PLENTY of success on their own merits, so I doubt you can unequivocally say they "suck."<BR>

<DD>Shadowslayer - That's kind of you to say...<BR>
RJ - It was the same tune with a different orchestration.  That particular tune functions as a love theme for Buffy & Angel.  I first used it in "Surprise".<BR>
drdan - If you hurry, and you live in one of 8 or so cities in the US, you can catch "The Alarmist" (Stanlet Tucci & David Arquette & Kate Capshaw star) which I did the music for.  I've scored a number of indie films which will be released over the next year or two...<BR>

The last time I was in a band was in college; we were called <as I cringe> "The Manics".  The first time I was in a band was in junior high; we were <as I doubly cringe> "Chris and the Cupcakes".  Really.<BR>
Not currently in need of drummers for the score, sorry...<BR>
(AndI just reread your question, and I think you meant "do you get to use a real orchestra", and the answer is no, I do it mostly with synthesizers and samplers with a couple of live players)</SMALL>

Shadowslayer - I wasn't expressing fear for a lack of defense so much as lamenting the fact that fewer people listen to (and as a result slam) the score than they do the songs.  I want to be slamworthy just like Erika!
