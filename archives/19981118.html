<DD>Oops!  forgot my col-or on that last post...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hey, I am typo-queen!  It's a common mistake, though, so I thought maybe you'd want to know.  Sorry if I insulted you!  =)  Really!<BR>
<b>Aiglos:</b>  As I just mentioned above, I am a typo-disaster!  Poor Apollo  has had to change my code at least 6 or 7 times cause I typo'd it.  Anyway, the point is, I know and love the word "cult," and would never misspell it.  Just a typo.<BR>

<DD><b>bluelight:</b>  Thank you!  Goodnight.  =)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>Well, thank you very much!  Yes, Jeff writes the majority of the music, although there are several songs on the album that I contributed co-wrote.  The lyrics are all Jeff, though.  (Except for Frenchie...which came from an answering machine message I left one day.)  Just a little music/spelling lesson:  the musical instrument is spelled "bass."  =)</SMALL>

<DD>Hiya, <b>LadyBathory!</b>  =)<BR>
<b>Clutjam:</b>Well, not to sound jaded, but it wasn't all that important.  And we have lots of great things happening for us!  Besides, even though it's just this little awards-ceremony, it was an honor to be one of the five nominees.  I mean, there are literally thousands of bands in L.A.  Could be worse.  =)  (I'm sick...my thoughts are jumbled.  Sorry.)</SMALL>

<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  I'm so pleased!!  By all means, go there.  =)<BR>
<b>Jade:</b>  Hi!  How are you?<BR>
<b>Bruce's Mom:</b>  Well, hello.  =)  The band's doing just fine, thanks.  In a less-playing-gigs, more-writing-and-recording mode right now.

<DD><b>blueronin:</b>  Hey, and G'night to you, too.<BR>
<b>kim!:</b>  Um..y'know, I don't think so.  If you can, it's not one of the col-or-code options I'm aware of.  And Hi!<BR>
<b>Aiglos:</b>Yeah, the Spikeness is of the major good.  (Of course, if I ever get the chance to meet James now, he's going to think I'm some crazy obsessed chick.  LOL  Honestly, I just dig the character!!)</SMALL>

<DD>Joss:  If you're scrolling, Hi!  And great work this season!  I can't wait to see Spike back in Sunnydale next week!  (yay!)  Oh, and please say hi to Kai for me.  =)

<DD>Well, that's all i've got time for.  I'm knackered -- this has been the hardest season yet.  I turned in the script for 10 two days AFTER I started shooting it.  That was a trip.  But i wanted to say hi, check in.  I think all viewpoints regarding X/W are valid, glad to see I could cause some pain and dissention.  I'll check in again sometime soon. ------j----

<DD>Yup, Eliza's from Boston, so we made Faith from there.  We always figured to make Faith from wherever the actress we cast was from -- no imposing fake accents on people (we all know how that goes).  As for spike's hair, it will never change.  The platinum brings out the shape of his face better than brown (I am not joking).  Besides, that's just who spike is.

<DD>I'm just excited about the X/W thing cuz it's the one secret I've actually been able to keep!  And it felt so right -- give her what she's always wanted just when it will make her miserable!  That's the JossY way.  Purr.

<DD>As for Spike, I think James Marsters delivers an Emmy caliber performance.  His big scene with Willow is astonishing from both of them.  Sadly, no Dru, but Spike sans Dru is so intense that it works.<BR>
You know, scrolling down, I see a number of people taking exception to my complete lack of maths and sciences.  Something about lightning behaving wrong.  Okay, I guess lightning is always drawn to the HIGHEST mystical power glove or something.  My bad.  As for demon dimensions, the one Buffy was in was NOT the one angel was in, time moves differently in each, and can somebody please lighten up?  Not that I'm bitter.

<DD>well, my computer's been down for a few weeks.  Much has happened.  We finished ep 9, which I suspect will generate MUCH fanfic (both adult and otherwise), and ep 10, which was christmassy.  But most important, I never got to see reactions to the scandalous Xander/Willow affair!  So speak out, postifers!  For or against?  (Not that this will change anything -- I just want to know).
