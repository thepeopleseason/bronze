<DD>Okay, here it is... THE LAST POST post post post....<BR>
<BR>
Forgive my missing anyone's question. Here goes:<BR>
<BR>
SpikeNip - Joss has all the ideas he needs for his musical episode.  As for yours... The Coughing Chorus!  (I have no idea what that means; as I indicated, I'm asleep right now.)<BR>
<BR>
Ophelia's twin - Glad you liked it. I hope to work in a classic piece of literature into all my scripts from now on.  For instance, my next one will have Anya reading that book... by that guy... You know, with the friend... Yes, it's nice to be well-read.<BR>
<BR>
Shpadoinkle - Yes, LMM was a reference to Dawn.  I tried to underline that in REAL ME when the crazy sees her and says "I know who you are... curds and whey..."<BR>
<BR>
There was much foreshadowing in RESTLESS.<BR>
<BR>
And yes, Buffy's gift was to the world.<BR>
<BR>
And I'm sorry you're shocked to see me here.  I won't let it happen again.<BR>
<BR>
bzengo - no comment.<BR>
<BR>
imnuts56 - Yes, you are, my friend.  But thanks for watching.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, must away now.  Good night and God bless...

<DD>Impaler General -  Thanks for the suggestions.  We'll do our meager best.<BR>
<BR>
And I'll pass on your instructions to Tim and David G., as well.<BR>
<BR>
fergusmum - Wellll, let me tell you, if you had any idea who I was, you'd be a swwonin' like a... you know, a swooning thing thing.  (That's just a small taste of my quick wit and razor sharp writing that's made me the envy of... that guy, you know... on that tv show.  Ah, forget it.)<BR>
<BR>
As for the GILES series... By the grace of Joss, I hope to.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson - I think you've been spoiled enough, young lady.<BR>
<BR>
And LenS... Let's see how you look in a speedo. ;-)<BR>
<BR>
Warning... This will be my next to last post, as I've been unconscious for the last six minutes.

<DD>Voila!  Yes, of course.  Stupid me.  Thanks, Shpadoinkle.<BR>
<BR>
And yes, vamps can eat some food.  While they usually don't enjoy it, once in a while some semblence of flavor comes through.  Or they just like the texture.  Hard to be on a perpetual liquid diet, you know.<BR>
<BR>
bzengo - We're always working on deratting the poor girl.  Then we get distracted by shiny objects.<BR>
<BR>
Miss Kitty will return!  (probably)<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob - I'm on it.<BR>
<BR>
DeAn - I wrote a piece for a graphic novel all the writers (and Amber) are involved with.  TALES OF THE SLAYER.  COming out this December.

<DD>Ophelia's twin - The Hunchback thing was my personal philosophy regarding the Spike/Buffy relationship.  The clever little idea of Buffy sitting in the outline was not mine, but of the director, Dan Attias, who knew nothing of our plans to kill her.  He just thought it was funny.<BR>
<BR>
Hello, swttmptation.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson, get up!<BR>
<BR>
Red Crayon - My pants were off way before DeKnight's.  <BR>
<BR>
Hey, banana.<BR>
<BR>
chalkdusty - I'll do my best.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, slayerdaddy.  Gamble at your own risk.

<DD>DeAn - Oh, I'll mock Joss all right.  He loves a good mocking.  Followed by the ritual firing.<BR>
<BR>
white wings - Oh, yes.  More fun than laughing.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy - Congrats on the bluing of the Christian.<BR>
<BR>
chalkdusty - Get up off the floor before somebody sees you.  My god, how embarrassing.

<DD>Red Crayon - What was the deal with Riley's suck jobs, you ask?<BR>
<BR>
The boy was messed up.  It was a taste of the darkside.  Something Buffy's experienced and he hasn't.  Was it a drug metaphor?  Sure.  Sex?  The twisted unromantic kind that makes you feel dirty.  It was a fascinating place to take clean cut boy before he flew off.<BR>
<BR>
And Spike vamped out in CRUSH.  He keep vamping when the occasion calls for it.  But domesticated Spike's hard to get worked up into a good vampface.

<DD>Evening, all.<BR>
<BR>
I've gotten some e-rumblings suggesting I haven't posted in a while, so...<BR>
<BR>
Joila!  (Or however you spell that.)
