<dd>Okay, really am leaving but . ..<br><br>Beldin, just saw your post and as it's Jenna related, I wanted to respond.  All of the strange phenomena in those books have at least SOME grounding in reality.  Bizarre as it may seem, all I've done is elaborated on existing documentation.  Of course, I've made it much crazier, but that's why it's fiction.  :)  If you like the Jenna Blake series, btw, you'll be happy to know that, at long last, it does seem as though there will be more.<br><br>Okay.  Really gone now.  *poof*<br><br>

<dd>dogtrot, my Buffy books or my original books.  Of the latter, I'd say try THE FERRYMAN.<br><br>OMF and dogtrot, of my Buffy novels (that I've written solo), I'm partial to THE WISDOM OF WAR and SPIKE & DRU: PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW.<br><br>Thoin, I'll do my best.<br><br>Kathypg, glad you liked it.  If, theoretically, there were a second one and if, theoretically, I was involved with it, I'd predict, theoretically, that it would be even cooler than the first one.  :)  Theoretically.<br><br>

<dd>Thoin, I'll think about the SG party, but I don't even know when PBP is.  :)  As for a Lorne novel, go for it.  Try "Buffy Editor" at Pocket Books.<br><br>KathyPG--it isn't as though I'm abandoning the book series.  I've done just a couple of these things now.  :)  I never said I wouldn't do any more, only that given how busy I am with other projects, MONSTER ISLAND may well end up being the last one.  That said, I'm currently writing "Voodoo Lounge," a novella that's a sequel to my Spike & Dru novel, only without Spike & Dru.  ;)<br><br>OMF--things are going well.  The above is the most recent news.<br><br>
