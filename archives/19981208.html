<DD>Damn!  One more thing.  Pguy, why not send a copy of said song to the show, care of me?  We'd listen.  Can't guarantee we'd post about it, but worth a shot.<BR>
<BR>
That's it.

<DD>I actually gotta bail.  But SOOO happy people dug the ep, which I thought was landmark.  (I don't know.  Things feel different now).  How 'bout those dusting effects?  And why no Darla -- it would have taken the edge off the Xander/Willow thing.  (Same reason why no Jesse).  Someone asked for quote about posting board:  "The posting board is... uh, the people are.. typing, and there is, they communicate from the typing.... my head is swollen".  I think that is succinct and neat.  I mean really, the posting board has become so much a community that it has engendered marriages, fierce fights, and several dozen clubs.  Not to mention provided a second (okay, third) home for me.  But I think my quote is really the thing to use, not that blather I just wrote there.<BR>

Good night to all, and to all a good night.     j o s s .

<DD>So, a lot of people upset that nobody learned anything in this episode.  But you know what I thought was cool?  Nobody learned anything in this episode!  For Cordy to cause such a hideous disaster and be totally unaware of it and not learn anything just totally makes me laff.  On the other hand, the audience learned (to be pedantic) the importance of Buffy's support group, so it's not like everything is the same.  Meanwhilst, Willow in leather.  Everyone seemed to have the same reaction I did to THAT.

<DD>By the by, here's the part I hate.  My ep is next.  No way it holds up to this one.  That sux.  (Note to self: kill Greenwalt.)  (and Noxon.)  (give self raise.)  (Bathe ferret.)

<DD>So, some people have seen the WISH, and they seem to share my opinion of it.  Aly   and David Greenwalt and Marti and RD are here with me, lovin' the response.<BR>
Aly sez: "hi".  (she spent a long time thinking that up)<BR>
David G. sez: "Marti and Joss came to me with this idea, I said 'What if in the new world, things were really nice and people were doing their homework and holding hands and stuff and the brave new world was all soft and gooey and good.  And, okay, had a chewy nougat center.  and then like, people would be happy, and they only thing they'd want to do is watch the new Angel show, coming this fall on the WB".  And then Joss looked at me in that way he has {not that lustful way, the other one. --ed.} and he either said, "Wow, why didn't I think of that/" or else he hit me in the head really hard with acomputer keyboard, I can't remember which.  {seriuos part:}I had the best time of my life directing the show.
