<DD>Hit and run opinion...  WITH SPOILER-LEVEL THOUGHTS<BR>
<BR>
Seems to me that "Helpless", with Giles' surprise dismissal, was another terrific example of how Joss and Co. treat complacency as a dirty word.  While other series find a comfortable groove and run in circles in it until the tigers turn to butter, Joss seems to realize that a show is like a snow globe - it's most interesting when you turn it upside down and shake things up every minute or so.<BR>
<BR>
That's it.<BR>
<BR>
Later...?<BR>

<b>Mudpuppy:</b>  Well, that kinda surprises me, since they gave me close-ups and everything.  Hmm...well, I guess I'm not all that memorable.  hehe.  (I was the chick in the black and white leopard dress in the Bronze.  I'm the only singer.  The band was behind me, on stage.)  Anyway, no tour.  Not for a while, at least.<BR>
<BR>
OK, I really have to go!  Bye!

<DD><b>Zeus</b> - - Hey, one of the characters in one of the scripts I'm working on is named "Zeus"!  Any relation?  As for being introverted, there used to be this girl in my neighborhood who was so introverted and quiet that we called her "Chatty Cathy" all the time just to tease her and try to get a rise out of her.  But she never gave us the satisfaction of getting upset at our taunts, which often made us just redouble our efforts.  I know it sounds cruel, but the story has a happy ending.  It turned out that she wasn't introverted, she was autistic.  See, the happy part is that she probably never even noticed our name calling... although she probably did still notice the cigarette burns.  Remind me some time to tell you the story about the kid we used to tease because he was so darned lazy, only it turned out he was actually in a coma.  (Boy, the joke was on us)<BR>
<BR>
Dreams of the Sweet variety, <b>Li'l Wil</b>.<BR>
<BR>
<b>"Spunky"</b> - - The sad truth is no one wins in a pun-off.  Everyone emerges poorer for the experience in the end.  (For the record, you whupped me, though)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Masquerade</b> - - Got it.  Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Blackheart</b> - - That is the best compliment I have ever gotten.  Thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Oops, little hand's on the three.  Gotta run.<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight, L.O.S.E.R.s...<BR>
<BR>
And goodnight, Seattle.  Wherever you are.<BR>

<DD><b>Masquerade</b> - - (through clenched teeth) For the last time, I am <u>not</u> a VIP.  Oh, BTW, I am so not the net boy.  Somehow the bookmark to your site that I thought I had captured, didn't work.  I am anxious to read your SAR thoughts.  You couldn't have disliked it more than me... not possible.  Can you give me the site name or whatever again?  Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
<b>L'il Wil</b> - - I heard rumors there was a vault somewhere where my posts were being stockpiled.  Ack!  That should finally expose me for the fraud that I am.<BR>
<BR>
<b>ANT</b> - - Oops, sorry about that.  Are my decades showing?<BR>
<BR>
<b>gazoo</b> - - It's not just the <b>jk</b> thing... take a look at the pattern: <b>SAR</b>, then <b>Passion</b>.  That means the next one should be another <b>SAR</b>.  Ahhhh!  On the bright side, it should leave all of the major characters still standing at the end.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Tiamat</b> - - Joss doesn't buy the flowers for the show.  He actually grows them all himself in a little flower garden he keeps in a plot of land behind the soundstage, where he toils for hours a day getting them just right.  He also keeps a loom in his outer office to make the cloth for all the costumes (including Willow's hat).  He is something of a micromanager when it comes to all aspects of the show.<BR>
<BR>
<b>"Spunky"</b> - - LOL... But, now I'm pun-ch drunk.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Monique</b> - - Hi, back.  And I agree with all of your "Helpless" observations except the ones that are just wacked out stupid.  No, on second thought, I agree with those, too.<BR>
<BR>
Gotta say, now that Giles has betrayed Buffy like that, there is no choice but to kill him off.  Maybe I just have an extreme view, but I think that any character who betrays Buffy should have his or he neck snapped.  Just my two centavos worth.<BR>

<DD><b>gazoo</b> - - Well, I figure if I ever wrote another episode, <b>jk</b> would have to add another category.  That's the main reason I haven't written another... it's not fair to make <b>jk</b> do all that work.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Brad Grenz</b> - - Yep, found my character map.  You never know now when I might go bilingual on you guys.<BR>
<BR>
<b>ANT</b> - - "In the house"?  You kids with your nutty lingo.  I can never keep up.<BR>
<BR>
<b>"Spunky"</b> - - Please tell <b>Mircalla</b> I dare her to say that to my face.<BR>

<DD>Hey, I made #3 on both lists of <b>Epitaphs of the Undead</b>!  I am both honored and crushed.<BR>
<BR>
<b>devil</b> - - Uh, who <u>is </u>Keyser Soze anyway?  I have no idea because Ive never seen The Usual Suspects.  Any relation to Sammy Soze, the home run hitter?<BR>
<BR>
Announcement: In response to a flood of e-mail on the subject, I will make an effort to keep all my post of the G-rated sort.<BR>
<BR>
<b>-mere- </b> - - You read my pome aloud in the production office of a network television show.  Nice job of getting back at me for posting your verse... and for making certain I <u>never</u> find work in Hollywood again.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, I finally went out and bought a French Computer, complete with Fenêtres 98, just so I could do this... <b>mélanie</b>.  Hope that worked, or else I am going to Concordé back over there and demand my Euros back.<BR>
<BR>
<b>L'il Tree</b> - - Appreciate the hot tub offer, but the lovely and delightful <b>Mrs. King</b> has threatened to rain bloody death on me should she ever catch me tubbing with another.  Sorry, but my Mom can be so possessive that way.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Ccool</b> - - Hey, lady!  I saw 'e from you in my box.  Paralyzing dread has prevented my peaking inside.  Is that dread warranted?<BR>
<BR>
Hi to the <b>VTbrat Squad</b> from the <b>Jenny Killer</b>.<BR>
<BR>
And I wanted to say that, contrary to what I posted to <b>Goddess Minerva</b> on Monday, I did <u>not</u> write last night's "Buffy".  I realized that about halfway through the episode.  But it does explain why I never got paid for it.<BR>
<BR>
<b>KAM</b> - - That's it... just "<b>KAM</b>".<BR>
<BR>
<b>Little Willow</b> - - Do you have any idea what time it is, Young Lady?<BR>
<BR>
And, tonight's ep... still mulling.<BR>
<BR>
Later,<BR>
Ty<BR>
