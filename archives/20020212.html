<dd>SPIKMEISTER: I’m an idiot, you guys haven’t figured that out by now??!?  :)<br><br>Net Slayerette: My taste is pretty basic disaffected ‘80s youth... U2, REM, Peter Gabriel, Tori Amos, Pet Shop Boys... and let’s just say my hope of somehow working Les McCann into Ep 18 ain’t gonna fly.<br><br>Twilight, Natasha, LifesaShow: Clearly, you guys have excellent taste.  Seriously, thanks.<br><br>Invincor: We devoted to EVERYTHING Mr. Head does, so you can bet we’re excited about it, too.  Long as he’s ready to jump back in to Ripper when it goes!  <br><br>DaLilBit: Write, write, write.  When you get home at night, when you get up in the morning, whenever you can, just keep writing, don’t stop, amass for yourself a bit of a library of specs you think are just right, then start giving them out to everyone you know who works in the industry.  Or, you know... be independently wealthy.  That works, too.<br><br>And hey, I'm gonna go out on a limb and leave you guys with a challenge... There’s a pretty big and none-too-subtle hint in tonight’s ep about the title, at least in terms of where it came from... the trick is gonna be going to the source and figuring out what it means and what it refers to... it’ll take some work for anyone interested, but I promise it’ll be worth it.  For anyone who’s up for it.<br><br>And that’s it, I’m out... thanks for the kind welcome, everyone, hope you enjoy tonight, can’t wait to see those of you able to make it on Sat.  Take care!<br><br>*poof-a-rama*<br><br>

<dd>Otts: No one does exquisite hurt like DeKnight, I would never be so presumptuous as to try, it would be folly.  And not the good kind of folly, the bad kind.  So I’m just trying my best not to screw up.<br><br>Algerina: I think the world is ready for Owen, I really do.  I think he was married to Amy the Rat on TNT’s Bull...<br><br>Marcee: Because I’m so good at it!!<br><br>Lilyana:  Zoinks!  We’re gonna hafta bring out the Sunnydale Fire Marshall!!<br><br>Cashmere: Now, where’s the dramatic fun in slack??!?  Besides, you shouldn’t feel too bad for Spike, things aren’t gonna be all bad for him.  He might have one or two things to look forward to.  Before we stake him.  Oh, wait, don’t tell anyone about that part.<br><br>Xanderella: Thank you for the generous compliments!  I loved the ending of Smashed to, our own Thomas Wanker did the music for the final sequence, and I, too, thought it was hauntingly beautiful.  I was sitting in the editing bay with Joss and Marti and Marilyn (the ep’s editor), and when we heard the music track for the first time, I almost got a little misty... luckily I carry those little travel packs of tissues with me everywhere I go. <br><br>Willoschicken_f: You haven’t seen the last of Halfrek, I’ll tell you that.  She’s not done with our crew yet.<br><br>Judydh: Yes, one more step in the evolution of the characters’ interaction, glad you picked up on it.  Before the staking.  Darn it, there I go again.<br><br>OK, sweetums, one more round, then I’m off to the set!!<br><br>

<dd>ShyGirl: Egg creams all around, I say!!  (Of course, it’s in my contract that my egg cream has to be bigger than everyone else’s, but pay no never mind to that, just a detail, just a detail...)<br><br>Lady Wolfsbane:  Thanks!  Is that a Canadian thing?  I [heart] Canada.  And not just for the Tylenol with codeine.<br><br>Cori: Hey, just finished writing 18 which is shooting now, so that’s next up for me.  And, hey, I got my popcorn popper set up, too... DeKnight!  I said POPCORN popper, cut that out!  <br><br>Winkerbean: Nice to be here, and nice to feel welcome, thanks.<br><br>Lilyana: I think we had the best performance at the Bronze in some time LAST week... how could we top THAT??!?<br><br>Spikemeister: I know, I’m not kidding about the egg cream thing.  And I’m NOT going through caffeine withdrawal, I really have no excuse...<br><br>Net Slayerette: I wish I know, I have a space cleared in the “B” section of my CD rack, too... I figure the thing should be rushed out by 2008, 2009 at the latest.<br><br>MS. Rufus:  Quelle embarrassment!  My bad.  It’s just... you know... the Rufus Wainwright thing... gads.  After E.T. came out and Drew suddenly became a girl’s name, I swore to my little pre-adolescent self that I would NEVER make that mistake with anyone else... good golly, I failed.  I hate myself.<br><br>

<dd>Slayerdaddy:  Ooooh, a belt-sander, my belt HAS been kinda rough lately... wait a second... that’s not what you meant at ALL, is it...<br><br>G’s Lucie:  Thanks for the kind thoughts!  Hints about Spike?  Spike’s road is only gonna get more frustrating... it ain’t easy livin’ with that dang chip in his head all the time.  Metal detectors at the airport alone would drive a man to distraction.  So, who knows, it’s only gonna get more interesting, I promise you that.<br><br>Hello, Mr. Rufus.  I appreciate polite more than you know.<br><br>Cashmere:  Mmmm, hot pokemans... wait a second... that’s not what you meant at ALL, is it...<br><br>JustLiza: I know, I was a little a-feared when I realized that’d be the case.  What if suddenly everyone is out to get me, and not in a good way??!?<br><br>Lilyana: Thanks for the sugar... glad I could bring you outta the woodwork!  I’m here trying to hold up the wall, myself.<br><br>

<dd>Lyndsay: I will indeed be there, I'm looking forward to it, though, I must admit, I'm a little nervous, it being my first time and all... I hope you guys are gentle with me.  DeKnight said something about chocolate syrup being involved for new guys, but I think he was talking about egg creams.<br><br>Petrona: I wasn’t aiming for “wonderful” as much as I was for “workmanlike.”  And light-hearted?  I dunno.  Light-HEADED... yes.  Oh, wait, that’s me, not the ep.  Yeah, I think light-hearted is pretty fair.  It was a fun, fun, fun episode to write, I got to do a teensy bit of comedy, some really neat personal interaction stuff, a smidge of scary (something I ALWAYS wanted to do and now finally can)... besides, I think I’m officially giving up on serious, because DeKnight proved last week that he is the BEST, and I would only suffer in comparison... my only hope is that I can sit at his knee and learn something... DeKnight, I said your KNEE, cut that out!!<br><br>Leather Jacket: I would LOVE to do a Buffy comic book, I’m hoping that the schedule will open up soon so’s I can.  Faith would be cool, but, let’s be honest, isn’t everyone clamoring for a story All About Owen the Poet?  Come on, who’s with me?  Anyone?  Hello?  Is this thing on??<br><br>Willowschicken_f: Why isn’t UPN showing it where you are?  What ELSE could be more important than BUFFY??  Listen, I’ll just describe it to you... see, we start with this big death scene... oh, wait, that’s not this one.  My bad.<br><br>

<dd>Hello, my little sweetniks.  Just wanted to pop in and say hi and see if everyone had their knives sharpened for tonight's ep... can you believe they let that Greenberg guy have a go at a second episode?  Good gracious, what were they thinking??<br><br>
