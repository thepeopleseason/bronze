<DD>Great fan club names all, people.  Might I also suggest "The Minear-keteers."  Long, obnoxious, and a little hard to say.  It's perfect!  If only Tim would show an interest...

<DD>  I have a plan so cunning you could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel... May I suggest "The Official Harrison Ford Fan Club"?  Now, I know you think you're spotting the flaw there, but honest, we'll get members this way.  Anyway, I'm off. Thanks for all good things.  See ya.

<DD> Thanks for liking it, Nu.  The last scene between Cordy and Angel at the end was pretty easy, actually.  A lot of thought?  Nevah!<BR>
<BR>
B/A crossovers?  One would expect.

<DD>Let's found a fan club for Tim... How about Tim's Toadies?  No...  Wait... Tim's Teetsuckers?  (That's awful)  Minear's Minions?  (No, Marti has "minions")  <BR>
<BR>
Ah, the hell with it.

<DD>  yes, Kitty, I know what's going to happen with Faith, and she will live or die.  <BR>
<BR>
Tim Minear Fan, is the screen name a happy coincidence?  Make me a damn fan club.  Fury struts around, all, "it's www.Fury.com, in case you were wondering."  It's so galling.

<DD>  for the the nice comments, thanks again.  I don't want to keep refreshing and thanking... but you keep praising and I just might.  But if you praised, assume I saw and approved.  God that sounds evil... as to the next ep, it will be ep 16, I believe.
