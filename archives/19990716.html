<DD>Oh one quick thing:<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man:  Yeah.  One of my stunt guys from BUFFY doubles Brad Pitt in that movie.  He kept coming to our set and telling me aobut it.  It sounds wild.  I wojn't spoil the ending for you.  But it's creepy:)<BR>
<BR>
Corvus:  Yah.  If stina sends me the info on the party I'll try to show you some behind the scenes video of the stunts there.  Although we have been shooting every Halloween so far. (Maybe if it is on the weekend)<BR>
<BR>
okay - take care now - bye<BR>

<DD>Green Falcon:  I did get to see some of the BLAIR WITCH a long time ago when those guys first made it and took it to a film festival.  I do plan on going to see it soon.  there is another one similar to it called THE LAST BROADCAST that is pretty good too.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway... I gotta go purchase some new crash pads for the new season.  I hope to catch you guys later on.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

<DD>Ozfan:  I did that flip up using a wire technique.  I also had a little ramp built that was wider than the stair rail so that Sophia could run up faster without having to watch where she stepped.<BR>
<BR>
I was actually surprised when Joss wanted to do that one.  I told him it would be slightly Xena-ish, but he said to do it.  I'm glad you liked it.  I plan on asking him to let me do some more things in a similar vein.  We'll see whether he thinks it fits or not.

<DD><Vpink>Polgara:  No.  That was Brad Martin that time.  Mike is the regular guy who does most of the stuff though.  <BR>
<BR>
You can actually Mike fighting Brad (as a bad guy vamp) on the dock in SURPRISE.

<DD>Wolvie:  Just whatever Joss feels like seeing in the episode.  No particular st<i></i>yle.  Whatever fits the mood.<BR>
<BR>
stina:  I don't know anything about it.

<DD>Brad G:  It was the white guy who does all the stunt hiring on MartiAL LAW.  He has sent left to back to that show since it was not canceled as everyone first thought.  Another guy is coming soon.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus:  Sophia did play a vamp once when Sarah had to be out of town doing Saturday Night Live.  It was when Buffy turned into a rat.

<DD>Mysty Mage:  No.  He's no longer around.  He's out there somewhere, but he stays far away from Sophia now.<BR>
<BR>
Brewster VK:  Yeah.  Mike Massa is his name.  He is a stunt buddy of mine from Florida.  He is the student with the flame thrower in that same scene.*<BR>
<BR>
also the Asian teacher with the goat-tee is also a vamp/ The blonde guy who gets slammed into the wall is the Oz double/ and the female vamp is the Kendra double.<BR>
<BR>
There were alot of people beating themselves up in that scene since I could only have 10 stunt people.

<DD>Corvus:  Average of 6 I suppose.  Sometimes as many as 20.  It all depends.  We have had as few as three though.<BR>
<BR>
Narrator:  It went well.  Twenty minutes later they talked to Todd too.  They say the BUFFY issue may be out in Sept. when the new shows air.

<DD> KAM:  Cool.  I hereby donate a cheap bit of cloth wrapped in duct tape to the cause.  It also contains a tiny bit of old Sophia/Karen sweat too.  YaY and rah!  (unless that is just a little toooo gross)<BR>

<DD>Misty Mage: I still have those handcuffs we used for the stunt action.  Only the close ups used real ones.  The rest was done using some cloth wrapped in duct tape.  <BR>
<BR>
Maybe I can give those away at the next posting board party or something.

<DD>This is pretty much a driveby.  i am blurry from lack of sleep and angry about more or less everything.  If I ever get my wits about me, expect LAFFS APLENTY when the new season of Buffy hits the airwaves -- all sorts of high jinks as our audience wonders if they'll EVER get off that island!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
i am very tiny.

<DD>Did someone mention Finola Hughes?  Oh, the love!  Anna Devane, deep college experience.  Gen Ho with my buds, senior year it was religion.  On a lighter note, there will be no more Buffy episodes.  I've forgotten how to write.  Sorry, but there's plenty of Gilligan reruns on TVland, and when you boil it down they're pretty much exactly the same show.
