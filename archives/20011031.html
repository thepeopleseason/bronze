<dd>Quick stop in. Saw a Q and yes, the musical ep isgoing to
be a few minutes longer, maybe run over by about six. So
set your VCR's accordingly, particularly since Tuesday
night is the ONLY TIME the show will be broadcast in its
entirety. It will run again but deep cuts will have to be
made -- UPN are gods for letting us run (a total of eight
minutes) long, but they can't do it on the rerun too. So
Watch! PS, has anyone seen the bills posted in LA (and
amybe NY?) I designed (with much help from the masterful
Jeph Loeb) a classic old style musical poster and the
brilliant Adam Hughes (He does covers for Wonder Woman
comics) painted it. It's something to see. Boy, after all
this effort, I sure hope you don't all hate the thundering
crap out of the show. That'd be oops. <br><br>
And yes, my name is still a virgin. It has yet to know the
love of another name. <br><br>
Naked, gay, goats, etc.... joss.

<dd>Forgot to mention: The guys a UPN said they'd get a linear
board up by the time the ep airs so I can check in and see
what people thought. But keep the pressure on! Just in
case. Also, soundtrack... we're definitely going to put one
out, but it may take a while cuz of contract bull$@&%, MAN
it's been a nightmare trying to set that up. I'm hoping to
have place at Buffupn for people to log on and click if
they're interested in buying it. If we set it up, click
away! (but if you do, just once, so we can get an accurate
number). I guess some execs didn't think there'd be much
interest, but I'm not looking to go platinum, just some
streaks or highlights.... sorry. Hair secrets. Not looking
for a hit record, just want those who want it to be able to
get it. But every step has been painful and insane and
pretty much shaken my faith in humanity. I also don't trust
Caribou anymore. They're out there, on the tundra,
waiting... Something's going down. I'm right about this.

<dd>Melida:  Steve's a real louse, isn't he?  And a deadbeat.  He still owes me $5 from college.<br><br>But hey, being his ghost does have its advantages.  Like just the other day I was hovering over him doing my boo thing when he was watching a rough cut of the musical.  I know the trailers on UPN look good, but let me be honest -- its a million times better.  So good it's gonna kill you.  Run!  Run for your lives!<br><br>- The Artist Formerly Known as The Ghost of Steve DeKnight<br><br>

<dd>The Ghost of Steve DeKnight (not the actual Steve DeKnight, who is currently suffering the ill effects of too much jolly jolly)would like to thank you all for watching this evening.  Once his frozen pineapple of a head thaws out, he'll pop by for an extended chat.  Hmm.  Smells like Friday to me, if cartoon Buffy isn't kicking my animated monkey butt.<br><br>
