<DD>Dark Angel - One of my favorites just did X-MEN.  (I forgot to tell Joss last time I saw him about this.  Maybe he'll read it here though)  Anyway, the boyfriend of the director of the X-MEN movie came to the set while we were shooting the opening fight of BEER BAD.  He said that they wanted to see how we really made those fights because they wanted a girl in the movie to fight like that.   They wound up hiring one of my favorite Hong Kong director/stunt coordinators to go in and choreograph and shoot the big fight for them.  His name is Cory Yuen Kwai.  So if you see anything cool in it, it probably came from him ;)<BR>
<BR>
Also they bought a special flying harness I designed to use in the movie too.  It's the first movie it's ever been used in.<BR>
<BR>
I do know that they are copying a fight from a Hong Kong movie that took place on the Statue of Liberty.  They broke the arm off the statue in the HK film.  I wonder if they'll do that on the X-MEN too?  <BR>
<BR>
All I know is that I want to see Rebecca Stamos and I'll be happy.

<DD>Dark Angel - Oh, and congrates on your new series too.  Even though I still support my people at Buffy & Angel, I do plan on watching DARK ANGEL this fall.  I think they are sinking a lot of bucks into it and it sounds really similar to the sci-fi script that Sophia and I have for her to do.  Hope you kick some ass this fall.  And don't let James Cameron wear you out too much ;)

<DD>Dark Angel - Thanks for that.  I've had some offers, but I have not bothered to do anything about it yet.  I'm hoping to take the time off I have for the moment and work on some personal projects.  Sophia and I always wanted to do our own low budget Martial arts thing, so we plan on shooting a trailer for it to raise money at the AFM this Feb.  Providing nothing else comes up and prevents us from spending the time on it.  That's what has prevented us from doing it for the past four years.  I've not taken a single week off until now.  I've been a bit burned out recently.  So time for a rest.<BR>
<BR>
Faithgirl - Yes I did choreograph that sword fight.  Thanks.  We are planning a sword fight between Sophia and the stunt double of the lead actress in this new movie.  It should rock (if Sophia is able to move her back that is)<BR>
<BR>
It was a gradual progression of getting them to listen to me over the years at BUFFY.  You can actually see the changes in the way we shot as we went along.  It was tough and I had to do it bit by bit.  I don't think they will ever go back to the way it was in first season again.  So it should  still be cool.  I never really got to do the ultimate though.  That will have to come later on another project.  I hope anyway.

<DD>Lil Pia - Yep.  That's what does it.  All those hits to grave stones and benches and poles and pavement and cars.  It all takes a toll.  <BR>
<BR>
One time I was taking the Jackie Chan Stunt Team to the airport and we stopped off in the bathroom.  Johnny Chung (the guy who really does most of the brutal falls) stood next to me at the urinal.  I noticed that the water in his urinal started turning red.  I was alarmed to say the least.  He just shrugged and said, "Sometimes Hong Kong stuntman pee red.  Too many kidney hit."  He's been with Jackie longer than any other guy and he stills does it.  I don't know if he's really human or what.  He just keeps going.  He makes me feel lucky.  My urine is still normal. hehe Whew.

<DD>jamie marsters - Yes.  All last season I used a caucasion Hong Kong stuntman named Steve Tartalia.  In previous seasons I had lots of other guys (including myself) doing the job.  None of us really looked enough like him until I got Steve.<BR>
<BR>
It's hard on him because he had to dye his hair and hang around waiting for a call from me that Spike was going to do some fighting.  Half the time he walked around with what we called the "skunk head."  That's when he'd find himself in between Spikeness with half brown and half beached hair.<BR>
<BR>
He's a great stuntman though.  He even put on a soldier suit, threw some temp black dye on his hair, and did that back-dive on the steel stairs stunt in PRIMEVIL.  He was just bored after doing his Spike duty and wanted to join in the action.  Nice work.  Knocked the crap out of him too. ;)

<DD>Mambo - I was only on one episode of INVISIBLE MAN as a stuntman.<BR>
<BR>
The Playstation Game will have lots of cool new monsters and we did a ton of wire stunts for it too.  They had us wear spandex suits with tiny sensors all over them to capture our motion.  I played Angel, Spike and some baddies and I had another couple of my stunt guys come in to play other characters too.  It was fun.  I got to play an early version of it.  I'm looking forward to the finished product very much.  It's just very time consuming to create.

<DD>ducky - I think that Sophia's back will be okay.  She just needs rest and therapy.  Right now they have two girls to double Buffy for the first episode.  One for gymnastics and one for fighting.  I'm sure neither of them will have to get slammed over and over onto concrete for four years for the show, however.  <BR>
The doctor was amazed when he saw her back X-Rays.  It was sort of like the time Buster Keaton's doctor said to him, "Hey, when did you break your neck?"  And he went, "Huh?"  He had no idea that his own neck had been broken during a stunt years before.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Her neck cartledge was destroyed during that infamous net fx gag back in second season.  So they are going to do some work on that too.  <BR>
<BR>
Well... nobody ever said that being Buffy would be easy.  Being a 100 lb. girl and fighting big guys everyday is not the easiest thing.

<DD>jamie marsters - You're welcome.  Sophia's foot still hurts a little, but it is getting better (she tore a tendon during the Playstation Game shoot for those who don't know what we are talking about)  Like I say, you know how she is.  It's hard to make her slow down and rest the injuries.  And when she gets back we want to shoot a special trailer for the AFM.  It will depend on what kind of shape she's in and what her doctor says once she finishes the film.

<DD>AJO - I've worked on THE INVISIBLE MAN (for sci fi channel) plus some pilot material  and we did the BUFFY Playstation thing too.  <BR>
<BR>
Sophia is supposed to start work on the new movie on the 14th now, but she just found out that she has had 5 fractures of the spine while working on BUFFY and one has become a "disc bulge" now.  So that is really bugging her.  I'm going to take her to therapy every day until she has to start the film.  She's just worried that she won't be able to do all the fighting and stunts that she wants to do on the project.  We'll have to see how it goes.  You know how she is though.  She'll tough it out one way or another.  She's just like that.

<BR>
Yes, I was just driving by and stopping to say howdy.

<DD>Stephen Weick - Hi.  Having the courage to speak out regarding injustice, despite threats from powerful people, is not small in any way.  In fact, it takes a great deal of courage to stand up in such a situation and dare to speak out.  Not many can do it.  Most simply fold under that kind of pressure and run.  I see it all the time.  Going along with whatever is popular or safe for oneself is easy.  Daring to tell the truth  can sometimes take a great deal of courage.  You may never really know what I am talking about.  If you are lucky.  <BR>
<BR>
Now ... if you or David Mello would like to talk about anything  that concerns the subject of myself or Sophia, then I invite you to email me at jeffprui@idt.net.  It seems to me that you and I used to talk quite a bit on the PB in the past.  I'll be just as honest with you as I always was.  I'll be happy to speak to you anytime,  but Joss and I both agreed to try to keep any of that stuff off the PB for the good of the show. And that's what I am trying to do.  If you will allow me to.<BR>
<BR>
Since you brought it up, I can only suggest you talk directly to me about it.  Maybe I can clear up a few misconceptions for you.<BR>
<BR>
As far as everyone else goes:  How's it going?  Hope you are all good.<BR>
<BR>
And thank you Sarah's Carl for putting my email out there whenever someone feels a need to speak to me about anything.
