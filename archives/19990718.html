<DD>Sultress - <Vpurple> I've heard that theater owners are real nervous right now.  They wnat congress to stay out of their business so they are trying to show that they are making a real effort to check id's.  <BR>

<DD>Sultress -  I''m going to be on BUFFY full time.  ANGEL has to be shot off of our studio lot now due to the fact that BUFFY is taking up all of the space.  It's just impossible for me to be in two places at once.

<DD>Paris Angel - I think the acting takes more of a toll on the emotions for the actors.  Often in the stunts they are unsure just what has happened in the fight.  We are moving so fast that we often have the fights shot before they are out of make-up and then I just show them the things we need them to do on the spot.  They know what happens to the characters, but they often don't know what kind of choreography has gone on.  Those goodbye scenes (and others such as the Buffy/Giles scene outside in "Passion") are the ones that really seem to take alot out of them.  Things like that.

<DD>Angle Man - One time I did the Hong Kong spin over and over onto the concrete in a movie until my elbow started bleeding on the inside of my skin.  The Asian stunt guys gave me some of their special med creme.  Only the stuff was really supposed to be for bringing blood INTO the area of sore muscles.  It caused my arm to swell up to twice its normal size.  People on the street were gagging at the sight of me. (I know what else is new)  I finally had to go to the hospital.  That was the ugliest thing any of us have ever seen.  (Except for those backwards feet things - which I will spare you the details of at this time ):0

<DD>Angle Man - You know what?  That has happened.  We have noticed people giving me the evil eye whenever Sophia shows up with visible bruises.  Sometimes I try to make her just stay in the car and not go in the grocery store.  I feel like shouting out, "Hey!  It's not me.  It's the vampires man!"<BR>

<DD>And btw - In case anyone brings up the Angel/Kendra fight again.  She got the drop on him and he was trying not to hurt her.  (He was good Angel - remember?)  That was just enough to give her the advantage she needed to force him into the cage.  Only then what he in serious touble.  (We also had the added disadvantage of having to have the Giles stunt double fill in for the Angel stunt double that day.  Thus the extreme high angle I requested.  It all worked very well and was just what the boss/Joss ordered)<BR>
<BR>
And per Joss orders Drusilla DID NOT perform Martial arts in her little fight with Kendra.  She moved EXACTLY the way Joss wanted her to.  We did have to simplify the fight due to the fact that we didn't have our Kendra double that day and had to rely on another girl who was not as proficient and we had to make the actresses try to do most of the fight.  This made it difficult to do what we really wanted and it took twice as long.<BR>
<BR>
And also --- bears eat kids too, but that doesn't mean that they can't fight.<BR>
<BR>
And --- Just because a wise guy makes a crack about an Uzi doesn't mean he knows anything about automatic firearms anymore than a guy who bombastically bellows his bile about "shoulda dones and I would've dones" when it comes to fights means he knows anything about that either.<BR>
<BR>
Trick had the drop on the slayers.  He crushed Buffy with a huge crate so that he could enjoy choking the life out of her (which fits right in with what his character keeps saying about his feelings towards her).  The other vamps were supposed to handle that Faith.  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>Kev - Karen Sheperd is the girl who does the stunt fighting for Faith.  She and Sophia have beaten each other black and blue so much this past season that it took over a month for them to heal up after we went on hiatus.<BR>
<BR>
Moriah - There is a site called "Shirleys World" that has a page on me and one on Sophia too.  I don't have one of my own yet.  Maybe one day I'll get around to that.

<DD>Rum Spike - Did you know that Jackie Chan has added one white guy to his stunt team now?  He's a guy from Austalia and he's one of the best at Martial arts stunts I've ever seen.<BR>
<BR>
Just thought you'd like to know that there's a guy from down under who's doing awesome stuff out there.

<DD>Thanks.  And guess what else?  Joss will have new characters showing up this season and he will write some very specific things that he will tell me that he wants to have happen.  Just as he did with the handcuffs, or how Buffy wipes up the floor with a whole group of wimpy aardvarkish vamps and then has trouble with a single vamp who has tons of fighting skills.  Just as it is in real life.  Some can do it and others just write about it on posting boards.<BR>
<BR>
He's just mad cause I came on and yanked a knot in his self righteous tail.  So he tries even harder by coming on here when he thinks I'm not around to try and trash me.  Well... guess again.  Here I am and I won't just turn off the board the way the others do.  I'll be more than happy to come on here anytime day or night and tell aardy what a jack-ass I think he is.<BR>
<BR>
Of course... that's just my opinion as a fan.  I have the deepest respect for what he does;)</SMALL>

<DD>Hi.<BR>
<BR>
Just popped in to once again say that aardvark is an idiot.<BR>
<BR>
Joss had very good reasons for wanting each of those fights to go the way they did and for the characters to behave the way that they did in those scenes.  If aardy were not such a self important little dweeb sitting there with his little feelings all stirred up and lashing out the only way he can at the world (through the keyboard of the computer his mommy bought him) then he would at least make some sense and ask some questions about it instead of behaving like a whining dumb-ass who got mad because someone dared to set him straight when he attacked them.<BR>
<BR>
aardwolfe ... there's one on every newsgroup and posting board.  Usually two or three.  They lure people in by pretending to be fans of a show and then try to make themselves look bright by writing long essays on things they are completely unqualified to speak on.  <BR>
<BR>
And God help the one who dares to slam him back.  'Cause those aardvarks live for that.  They'll spend an inordinate amount of time dedicating themselves to dispensing their special poison.   The fun is in suckering others into thinking that it is all an "intellectual discussion."  Maybe that's the only thing they have inside them.  When others start to catch onto that sick game and begin to bust his chops on a regular basis he suddenly will become "Mr. Misunderstood."    Doesn't work on me though.  When I see an aardvark crossing my road I plan on aiming my 4 wheeler right at it.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Did I mention that he's a moron?
