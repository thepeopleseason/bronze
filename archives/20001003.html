<DD>miremba: hi there! I guess I better check my mail!<BR>
<BR>
ProphetS: thanks! What bands do I like? Queen, STING, ELO, Aussies like John Farnham, Jimmy Barnes, Icehouse, Hunteres & Collecters ETC. As for film music in case that's what you were asking, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Christopher Young, James Newton Howard.<BR>
<BR>
Mabb: the year is shaping up great. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the next batch of Angel epps you will get absolutely ROCK!<BR>
<BR>
Zelda: thanks, very nice compliment indeed. I didn't get to see or tape Dark Angel, maybe next week. <BR>
<BR>
Sushi, thankyou.No Bellhop theme, but Tim Minnear keeps asking for trumpets blasting over quiet love scenes, and flapping shutter sound fx in the distance. If he appears on Bronze you might ask him about that!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks all, gotta run.

<DD> Hi Bronzers! Hope you enjoyed tonight's Angel. I think Tim Minear did a fantastic job: it's one of my alltime favorite episodes.

<DD><aqau531>Thanks, Misty.   But one last thing.  I prefer fans under the age of 18 to call me MR. Fury.  <BR>
<BR>
Or Uncle Davie, whichever you're more comfortable with.<BR>
<BR>
But never, and I repeat NEVER call me Hackboy!  (It makes me cry.)

<DD>And since one or two of you asked, I'll plug my episode of Buffy tonight...<BR>
<BR>
It's the best BUFFY episode this week!!!<BR>
<BR>
(unless, of course, there's reruns on somewhere.)<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I think it's about time Buffy's lil sis got her own episode, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
Okay, going back to work now...  Bye.

<DD>greetings and salutations, Bronzers and Bronzitas...<BR>
<BR>
wanted to mention that tonight's episode of "Angel" (written by Tim Minear) is freakin' <b>FABULOUS</b>. frankly, i think it's the best work we've ever done. <small>and don't call me Frankly.</small> production value through the roof, great acting, and... oh yeah.  the script doesn't suck, either.<BR>
<BR>
can't wait to check back in here tomorrow!<BR>

<DD>Hello, Bronzers...<BR>
<BR>
I just wanted you to know, with all your viewing options this evening, that you are in for the most BRILLIANT, AMAZING,  EMMY-WORTHY ANGEL episode ever, written by my friend and colleague... Tim something.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I'd blow off any overhyped, ill-conceived, so-called adventure shows on other networks at that time if I were you.<BR>
<BR>
And remember, come election time, vote for the candidate you hate least.<BR>
<BR>
Just a friendly public service reminder.
