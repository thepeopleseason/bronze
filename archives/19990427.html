Hey Danny, I have the same problem when I use Explorer.  Use Netscape if you have it.

<DD><b>KAM:</b>  Hi!  Yep, lot of cool tunes are swirling around over here!  =)<BR>
<b>Opus & Cosmic Bob:</b>  Well, her iMac is having a problem getting into the site!  I even tried to help her with it, and it just locks up.  Very weird.  But she's coming by here tomorrow, and we'll check it out then, OK?  And her birthday is in November.  I'm not sure about the exact date.  But you've got a while, don't worry!  lol<BR>
<b>TMorel:</b>  Hehehe....*blush*<BR>
<b>FanUK:</b>  Eek.  I'm sorry you're freaking.  =(<BR>
<b>M.W.:</b>  Why, thank you very much!  Glad you like it.  As for the injury, I'm staring physical therapy in a few weeks.<BR>
<b>Wolfshadow:</b>  Hiya.

<DD><b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Yes, I got your e-mail this morning...I'm honored to be one of the few CDs you purchase a year!  =) My stereo's not even set up right now, 'cause Jeff's using it down at our rehearsal space, but if it were, I'd probably be listening to Cake.  Or maybe Radiohead.  I just had a headache this weekend, but I think what you heard about is my ongoing struggle with my jaw.  (From when I hit my head, passing out in the ER)<BR>
<b>Basia:</b>  I wish!!!  I'd love to attend.  I'm from NJ, you know.  I'd love to come back for that, but I just can't.  =(<BR>
Hi to <b>FASTEDDIE, Vamp1, & TV James!</b><BR>
<b>StG:</b>Things are pretty nice out here right now!  =)</SMALL>

<DD>Hello...<BR>
<BR>
I saw that <b>AjO, Cosmic Bob, Basia, Lovely Poet, Closet Buffaholic, StG, and deadboy</b> were here, so I thought I'd say hi.
