last post, noodle call<BR>
<BR>
VT - Takeyourirontakeyourirontakeyouriron and you'll be all giddy again!<BR>
<BR>
WierdArchives - ummm... wha?  Ohh, do you mean is there a CD out there of some non-Buffy stuff of mine?  No, not yet... "Guinevere" will have 4 (count em) score pieces on an otherwise jazz-heavy CD when the movie comes out in Sept.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Demoriel (Bye Demoriel)<BR>
<BR>
tallgirl - yup<BR>
<BR>
Nicky - As far as I know the Buffy folks are always on the lookout for new and/or unsigned talent.  Assuming a Bronze-like college gathering place I can't see why this won't continue.  But it's not my department, sorry.  (e me)<BR>
<BR>
Oh and you can write to Patricia Joseph at TVT Records, 23 4th Street, New York, NY 10003 if you want TVT to put a score piece or two on the song CD.<BR>
<BR>
David Fan - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Bye everyone.  I probably won't be back for a few weeks so take care.

Claddagh - thanks, actually it's Berlin first (brother visitage) then Spain<BR>
<BR>
Carita - No, Alex won't be the other "Angel" composer.  That will be Robert Kral, a very talented composer who actually sounds a bit like me..<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx - see below.  Agreed re: cocoa puffs.<BR>
<BR>
Fatima - LOL!  My first movie score ever.  Thanks but... the score sounds like a first score.  Can't hear it without cringing.  Then again some of the Buffy season 2 stuff is starting to make me cringe.  But I cringe more at Crossworlds.<BR>
<BR>
BeMu - hi.  And I'd much rather have VT slightly out-of-control, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
Hi Angle Man<BR>

VT - Sympathy waaaaa's aplenty over here.  Take it easy OK?  (You're still coming to LA right?)<BR>
<BR>
hi Ajo - see post below re: my utter lack of busyness<BR>
<BR>
QueenC - happy birthday.  And I don't know when I go back to work.  I leave for Spain on Manday, get back two weeks later.  They just wrapped ep 1 of "Angel".  Hopefully it'll be all nice 'n ready for rock 'n roll when I get back from Spain.<BR>
<BR>
loki - Thanks.  "Guinevere" opens *the same day* as another movie I just finished "Dog Park" (which BTW opens on 700 screens, my biggest release ever).  I think Sept 24 of this year.  It'll be a big weekend for me.<BR>
<BR>
AngelLover 24-7 - Yup I'm doing at least the first bunch of "Angel" episodes (right before I collapse another composer will take over)<BR>
<BR>
WeirdArchives - for silly marketing reasons Fox won't allow an instrumental soundtrack until at least six months after the song CD is released.  So I guess it's stuck in traffic too only six months behind!<BR>
<BR>
bye LadyJack, thanks for the welcome

Carita - Happy Canadaday back atcha.  And actually I've been (pronounced "bean" for Carita) completely un-busy.  Just hired myself a new assistant (Alex from Russia, don't mess with him, he's got connections) and showing him the ropes.<BR>
<BR>
hey Missi, thanks for the largefontedness<BR>
<BR>
hi Hollyn<BR>
<BR>
Hey Sarah W., great job as per usual on the CBCC site.  Did I see you were going on vacation...

Cosmic Bob - can't remember if I mentioned this already but Peanut Butter Crunch was highly recommended to me by a Bronzer some time back... and I must say I give it mixed reviews.  Kinda combines the worst qualities of both, the result being a vaguely annoying hint of peanut cap'nishness instead of the waterfalls of delicious I was expecting.  I have an unopened box of Apple Jacks with the new green apple pieces... looks yummy.<BR>
