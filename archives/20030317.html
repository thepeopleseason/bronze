<dd>MAJOR WIGGINS - John King, the music supervisor for they show, selects all the music.  He'll watch a scene where the producers want to place a song and John finds one that fits the mood and tone of the scene.  Ultimately the producers make the final decisions.<br><br>I'm the script coordinator, so I essentially proofread all of the writers' scripts.<br><br>

<dd>We're sort of a '70s punk throw back.  We play high energy rock 'n roll.  (i.e. Ramones, New York Dolls, Donnas, Dead Kennedy's)  We're pretty fun.<br><br>
