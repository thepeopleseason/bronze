<DD>Before I go, I wanna answer <BR>
Nick:<BR>
<BR>
"Bring It On" had about 28 <BR>
minutes of score in it.  <BR>
Unfortunately very little of it <BR>
was of any note... nature of the <BR>
beast (high school comedies).<BR>
<BR>
I did the opening cheer / <BR>
dream sequence (but none of <BR>
the other cheer routines), all <BR>
the mushy love stuff, the big <BR>
slo-mo montage at the <BR>
nationals, and a bunch of <BR>
more transitiony / underscory <BR>
things, mostly with an <BR>
aggressive techno bent.<BR>
