<DD>Hi.  This is Nancy Holder, one of <BR>
the Buffy book authors.  I'm <BR>
trying to get in contact with <BR>
"Little Willow" AKA AC.  If you <BR>
have her home phone number, <BR>
please email me asap.  I was <BR>
supposed to call her as soon as <BR>
Angel was over, and I've lost her <BR>
number.

<DD>Well, i should <BR>
probably start the process of <BR>
actually getting up.  Yes, I am <BR>
on a mac, though not for much <BR>
longer I suspect.  And yes, the <BR>
run of actual new eps begins <BR>
tonight if I'm not mistaken, and <BR>
it's buff-tastic!  And I swear on <BR>
my like never again to use the <BR>
term buff-tastic! as there is <BR>
something just inherently wrong <BR>
there.  Be good, and remember our <BR>
Marching song:<BR>
<BR>
SPLATTY-BOY<BR>
HE'S SO ALLURING<BR>
SPLATTY-BOY<BR>
DRIVING IN HIS AUTOMOBILE<BR>
SPLATTY-BOY<BR>
FRIEND TO THE SQUIRREL<BR>
AND TO YOU AND ME<BR>
<BR>
(DRIVE DRIVE SPATTY<BR>
DRIVE TO THE SEA IN THE AUTO....)<BR>
<BR>
Until after now....<BR>

<DD>Calypso, i'll give you <BR>
one hint:  It's the portrait of <BR>
Lady Agnew of Lochnaw by John <BR>
Sargent.  See if you can figure <BR>
it out.  (You know how you love a <BR>
band and you wish evereyone loved <BR>
it and then they do and you get <BR>
grouchy and you're all, "well I <BR>
liked them first"?  That's me <BR>
with Sargent.  I fell in love <BR>
with his work in highschool, now <BR>
he's all the rage and I'm gettin' <BR>
NO credit.  Bitter.  Bitter, <BR>
bitter Splatty.)<BR>

<DD>Okay, I complain about <BR>
AOL, but we have something like <BR>
Internet Explorer at work and the <BR>
windows are so small you can't <BR>
see a whole post all at once.  So <BR>
AOL still in front for me, <BR>
despite.<BR>
<BR>
As for being here at 7:30, crazy <BR>
little thing called jetlag.<BR>

<DD>Yes, I did see Tony <BR>
while I was in England, had a <BR>
lovely lunch, he is a gentleman <BR>
and a scholar and a freemason and <BR>
a haberdasher.<BR>
<BR>
Am very much wanting to see <BR>
Scotland again, suspect it may be <BR>
the most beautiful place on <BR>
Earth, want to see if I'm right, <BR>
also there is a painting in the <BR>
Edinburgh Gallery that I went <BR>
steady with for a year and a <BR>
half, want to see if she's still <BR>
hanging.<BR>
<BR>
Oh and speaking of my cast, also <BR>
saw Aly   race before I left.  She <BR>
was great, edged out Ashly Judd <BR>
in the last lap, she's a <BR>
speed-demon and I swelled with <BR>
pride.<BR>

<DD>I see mention of the <BR>
whole "paying for autigraphs" <BR>
thing.  Want to speak up in <BR>
defense of David and my actors:  <BR>
Stores and events will often pay <BR>
an actor or fly them somehwere <BR>
nice to do a signing.  The store <BR>
gets publicity, business and can <BR>
charge for the autographs, but <BR>
the actors aren't getting that, <BR>
they're not charging people for <BR>
their signature.  We didn't even <BR>
know that's how it worked unitl <BR>
Aly and Tony went to Santa <BR>
Barbara to sign at a comic store.  <BR>
One little girl was sad that she <BR>
could only have Aly   sign one <BR>
thing -- of course Aly   grabbed <BR>
the other thing and signed it as <BR>
well -- and the store was a <BR>
little confused when I dropped by <BR>
becasue I signed a few things for <BR>
free and threw their plan off.  <BR>
(actually, I stopped by David's <BR>
signing and they were very nice, <BR>
asked me if I wanted to sit and <BR>
sign but I suddenly felt like Sam <BR>
Rockwell in Galaxy Quest and ran <BR>
out of their instantly.)  Truth <BR>
is, some actors DO need a little <BR>
extra money over hiatus <BR>
sometimes, but they're not out <BR>
there gouging little kids.  Had <BR>
to speak on't.<BR>
<BR>
In other hatred, why can't AOL <BR>
4.0 print my whole post?  Why do <BR>
they hate me?  Why am I so <BR>
homely?  Why are there people <BR>
like Frank?<BR>

<DD>Hullo!  Hullo all!  <BR>
Cheerie-bye!  Cup a' tea!  Hullo!<BR>
<BR>
Can you not see how british I am?  <BR>
Is it not CHARMING?  I'm back, <BR>
I'm lagged, I'm posatively STICKY <BR>
with charm.  England my England.<BR>
<BR>
Well, not technically MINE, but <BR>
true blue AMERICAN though I am, i <BR>
still have this fantasy wherein I <BR>
am knighted for my cool dance <BR>
moves and become known as SIR <BR>
Joss Whedon, or possibly just <BR>
SPLATTY-BOY.<BR>
<BR>
David B saved my life: a true <BR>
story.  Had no idea he was in <BR>
town.  When I watched the Big <BR>
Breakfast I was mortified, for <BR>
they are wacky and hyper and full <BR>
of CRAZY FUN and I thought it <BR>
would be nice to die rather than <BR>
have to appear wacky and full of <BR>
anything besides bile.  But David <BR>
is there, a bud to talk to, to <BR>
hide behind; he was graciously <BR>
wacky and put me at ease, what a <BR>
sweetie.  And everyone was very <BR>
nice.  <BR>
<BR>
And, Oh, nice fans outsdie, <BR>
giving me an ever-so-thoughtful <BR>
pair of undies.  Large white <BR>
men's undies.  Gosh.  Yes.  <BR>
lovely.  With the, the men's... <BR>
yeah.  It's all about dignity.<BR>
<BR>
But London is a dream, I'm never <BR>
happier than when I'm there.  But <BR>
it's back to work, have to finish <BR>
editing, start breaking new <BR>
stories.  That's nice too.<BR>
<BR>
London.....<BR>
<BR>
The oddest thing.  See here the <BR>
talk of doing the show with <BR>
Eliza, saw the article in TV <BR>
Guide online, and just list night <BR>
I dreamed Marti and I had written <BR>
the pilot for Faith's spin-off!  <BR>
(It was too Angel-heavy, so we <BR>
decided to make it an ep of Angel <BR>
and write a whole new pilot).  <BR>
Now, must stress, Show called <BR>
Buffy, love to make show with the <BR>
Sarah, not changing show now.  <BR>
But coincidence, no?  Wish I HAD <BR>
TIME to do another show.<BR>
<BR>
And Rolling Stone.  Very happy <BR>
about that, particularly the <BR>
caption under my picture that <BR>
said "THE MAN", lovely way to be <BR>
described, only wish it had said <BR>
"SPLATTY BOY" as well.<BR>
<BR>
Was anybody else disturbed by my <BR>
