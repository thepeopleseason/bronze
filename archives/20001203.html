<DD>OK, I've got to run...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Morella:</b>  Thanks!  As for seeing us live, that's why the new CD is an ENHANCED CD!  SO you people far far away can get a chance to see a live show.  (Well, sort of.)  See, the CD has a 20 minute concert video (QuickTime movie) plus a Flash photo gallery and stuff.  So, it's a live CD with a video of the performance that was recorded for the album!  Cool, huh?  ;-)  And no, it isn't being distibuted anywhere other than via the internet.  (Or by mail order.)  Check out the site!  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<b>amorphia:</b>  Thank you very much, and I would <i>love</i> to come play the UK sometime.  It's just a matter of funds, you know?<BR>
<b>CharlieX:</b>  Hi, there!  I haven't been on for almost 2 months, myself, so I know what you mean.  Nice to see you!<BR>
<b>Coyote:</b>  Thanks, it was nice to meet you too, and think about getting the new CD if you wanna see us "live."  =) <BR>
<b>motorcylce au pair boy:</b>  LOL<BR>
<b>Elly:</b>  You're welcome, and you rock, too!<BR>
<BR>
OK, I have to go.  See you all soon!<BR>

<DD><b>greeneyes</b>No worries.  =)  I hope to meet you (and a whole bunch of other fabu people) this Feb, too!<BR>
<b>Mrs. Pointy:</b>  Yes, we have our CD release party for the new LIVE ALBUM tonight!  I'm reallt looking forward to it.  =)<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Hey!  Yes, we did!  And we got your note, as well.  =)  As for "Why Can't You Behave," we were <i>going</i> to play that tonight, but Brian (the main guitar player on that song) has been very sick, and hasn't been able to rehearse with us, so we're not going to be able to do that one.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>joe the owl:</b>  Happy Holidays to you, too.  Yes, I (along with my band) was on the episode "Never Kill A Boy on the First Date."  Just singing.  No lines or anything...but it was very cool!<BR>
<b>Lioness:</b>  Hello!<BR>
<b>TickleBunny:</b>  I see......  *ahem*

<DD><b>Beldin:</b>  LOL!  You have no idea!  (I'm posting, then stuffing envelopes, then posting again, then stuffing more envelopes...)  I managed to get all the autographs done last night, though, at least.  *phew!*  ;-)<BR>
<b>Morella:</b>  Yes, it is, thanks.  Very busy trying to get the pre-orders for our new live CD out to the waiting fabulous fans, and we also have a CD release party/concert this evening, but this kind of busy-ness is of the good, no?  ;-)<BR>
<b>Narrator:</b>  LOL!<BR>
<b>Coyote:</b>  Hi, nice to meet you, and thanks!  =)

<DD><b>Kenickie:</b>Hey - nice to see again!  ;-)<BR>
<b>TickelBunny:</b>  What?  Really?  Why?  And thank you for the good wishes...<BR>
<b>Willow's Gimp:</b>  Yes, well...I was letting that part slide as "artistic license" or something, but spelling is spelling, you know what I mean?  hehehe  As for the Velvet Underground, I have to admit I'm not overly familiar with their stuff, (and what I've heard kinda wigs me out), but from what I do know about them, I would say that the fact that they just threw out all the "rules" and did whatever the hell they wanted to, sonically, was a HUGE influence at the time and proved to be a harbinger of things to come.  I know they've been listed as an influnce by just about <i>everybody</i> in the music biz...  (Not by us, but hey, who are we?)  So, I guess my answer is "both."  ;-)<BR>
<b>Mrs. Pointy:</b>  Things go well, thank you!  =)  And with you?

<DD>Good Morning...<BR>

I've been scrolling, and I just wanted to point out that for all his/her philosophizing and his/her not-so-subtle insinuations that he/she is more intelligent than we poor deluded Bronzers, <b>opg</b> can't spell!  ;-)<BR>
