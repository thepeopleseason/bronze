<DD>And yes, this truly is it, but I had to say:  No Beck cameo, nor Zombie neither.  Just thought you all were wasting a lot of energy there.  Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
nite.  (boy, typing night with an "e" instead of that "gh" sure is a labor saving device!  Yessir!)<BR>
<BR>
bye.

<DD>See how I leave?  By DEGREES, people.  ShellyanOrphan, did I spell your name right?  Sweik -- I tend to agree: trust the tale, not the teller.  Art exists beyond it's creator.  Having said that, anyone who thinks "It's a Wonderful Life" is about the effect of small blue crayons on pro basketball would be, oh say, CRAZY, or at least a little wide in their interpretation and you heard it here first, Oz ain't evil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today's sced: as an example of a typical day:<BR>
Watch filming<BR>

<BR>
It ends with "Post way too much" and then go back to work.<BR>
<BR>
God bless us, everyone.

<DD>Okay, this is it. I have to go work on the Angel pilot.  Oh, I'll sign anything I get, by the by, happy to.  Well, not ANYTHING, I wouldn't sign a bomb or anything, I mean certainly not my whole name anyway, I'd probably just write "Joss" or "best wishes, Joss" and then run away.  But hey, let's not find out!<BR>
<BR>
(suddenlyworried that someone will take this literally, some dark, troubled person who knows a lot about bombs and stuff, did I mention that I'm not signing it?)</SMALL>

<DD>Cyprus, you'll be happy to know that I am in no way troubled by your catholicism.<BR>
<BR>
And yeah, we do kind of think of this ep as a jumping off point for the Angel series.  Certainly some of the issues touched on here will be explored further there.  But not to fear, Angel and Buffy have a few more twists in the road before he finds his own path -- and a few more after, as well.  Love, after all, springs eternal, and they're just so darn CUTE!

<DD>Xander in the snow.  Okay, what pleases me most is that one person posted that they cried, seeing him, but Kai laffed her ass off.  Anything that causes both reactions is okay TV, sez I.  The thing that doesn't work for me is why is he telling Willow about his xmas ritual>  She'd know that.  Well, we were working the scene and he was supposed to be telling Sarah and she replied to it but we reblocked and it wasn't until I watched the dailies that I said "hey, that doesn't entirely track, him telling Willow, oh well, no one will ever notice unless I do something moronic like posting about it".  That's my inside tidbit for the nite.

<DD>Well, i know you've all heard me say this before, but I gotta go in a minute.  Glad some people dug.  Yes, we will get into rerunville now -- nobody puts on original programming during the holidays.  Sorry.

<DD>But enough about me.  Let's talk about that flashback of Angel drinking and falling down!  David cracked me up so badly.  He was COMMITED to that scene.

<DD>well hello there.  Reading and lurking I, and weighing in thus: The snow was not evil!  The snow was good.  It was hope.  Now another issue:  was the snow just a cheap Deus Ex Machina?  Well, obviously I don't think so or I would avoid the question.  The DEM term is usually used to indicate a cheap easy twist that wraps things up.  I know some people here thought it was corny (can't really argue), but I didn't just pull it out of a hat.  The whole ep was leading to that, it was the point, not just a way to end it.  Third thing:  was it God?  Well, i'm an atheist, but it's hard to ignore the idea of a "christmas miracle" here (though the PRAY on the marquee was an unintentional coincidence).  The fact it, the Christian mythos has a powerful facination to me, and it bleeds into my storytelling.  Redemption, hope, purpose, santa, these all are important to me, whether I believe in an afterlife or some universl structure or not.  I certainly don't mind a strictly Christian interpretation being placed on this ep by those who believe that -- I just hope it's not limited to that.  My fourth point, and I really think this gets to the heart of the issue:  I'm kind of dull.
