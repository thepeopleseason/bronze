<DD>Angle Man:  you're confusing me, man.  Yeah, it was definitely cramped, but we wanted to fit it all in.  I think you'll see that #3 diverges greatly from Joss's script, in order to fit into TV continuity. But what were you asking about, Buffy going home, etc?  And when did Joss say what was canon?<BR>
<BR>
Chris Beck:  First of all, I'm driving over to your house to get that rought cut right now.  Secondly, as far as Helpless, i think the execution was top notch, the music definitely helped (and I'm not just saying that), but I can't help expressing my surprise that Joss would approve an idea which is basically "most Slayers aren't good enough to live until they're 18, so when we have one who's that skilled, we'll do our best to kill her."<BR>
<BR>
But that's just me.

Brittany:  no problem.  I plan to return to the Shadow Saga eventually, but first up, I have a new fantasy novel out from Signet in Sept. Called STRANGEWOOD, and then a couple of other new original novels in the next year or two (as well as Buffy and other stuff).

theSlayee - I see we have a fellow music <s>geek</s> maker in the house.  My stuff is mostly sequenced, with one or two live players thrown in for sweetening.  I use MOTU Digital Performer, and Roland and Emu samplers (lots of them).<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - I have no idea who wrote/directed "Bad Girls".  My working tapes have no credits, sorry...<BR>
<BR>
C.Golden - Hi back atcha.  I can't wait to see what I'm going to do with Consequences either.  Wait a sec, I can't wait to <i>see</i> consequences.  Oohh, I just realized, there's a tape of the rough cut waiting for me when I get home.  I guess for me it *is* Buffy Tuesday!  hehehehehe<BR>
<BR>
Hey, Chris, by the way, did you change your opinion of "Helpless"?  Last time we were on you expressed some mixed feelings about the script.<BR>

Thanks to everyone else who said hi.  Can't keep up.<BR>

BRITTANY:  First off, thanks so much for your comment about the Shadow Saga, I'm very proud of those books.  Secondly, you should know that Peter Octavian was created in 1989, and first published in 1994, more than two years before Angel was created.  Just thought I'd mention it.

Paul, Asanti, Monique, ASweetie, Otto - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Hi SuperBuffyGrrrl.<BR>
<BR>
poohbee - the finger snap thing you refer to I'm guessing was in Helpless.  Yes, synthesized.  The live perc was in "The Zeppo", mostly bongos and shakers supporting the spazzy violin.<BR>
<BR>
Jenn Lynn (can I call you Jenn?) - Both films I did went into Sundance pre-sold: "Guinevere" (Miramax, Sarah Polley, Stephen Rea, directed by Audrey Wells who won the screenwriting award) and "Thick as Thieves" (October Films, Alec Baldwin, Andre Braugher).  Which films did you guys sell?  <BR>
<BR>
Foremerly Stephen - re: the love them stopping as Xander walked in - How else could you do it?  It seemed obvious.  (Especially right after Joss told me to do it that way.)<BR>
<BR>
horizon - I'll be cutting it close for the next three weeks.  Two more eps to do right before air.  Now *that's* fun.<BR>
<BR>
AngelLover - do I get scared of posters?  Well, I'm terrified of getting on Sarah W's bad side.  I hear she;s got a roundhouse that'll send you to Timbuktu.

<BR>
Also happy to say that, though Nancy and I are not collaborating at present (on novels, we're still doing Buffy non-fiction together), we both have solo Buffy adult novels coming out.  Hers, The Evil That Men Do, is a July book, and mine, Sins of the Father, I think is November.<BR>

Oh, and SOs to SarahW. Everdawn DeMoriel, Laurence, and I'm sure I missed a bunch of familiar names.  Didn't scroll too far.

Robyn - hi<BR>
<BR>
ThePlayer, minnie -  thanks<BR>
<BR>
horizon - thanks, I'm personally very fond of the "Helpless" score (maybe my favorite this season?), and that scene in particular.  If they had a Freaky Climax Thing emmy category I'd definitely submit that scene.<BR>
<BR>
DeM - I've heard it.  Very funny.  Punchline to very similar joke:  uhh. can't remember.  But something about Ghandi and supercalifragilistic etc.  Anyone?<BR>
<BR>
HollyJ - Yes, I did the Zeppo score, and yes, the similarities with BBB were intentional.  I guess the frantic spazzy violin has become our "Xander being frantic and spazzy" theme.<BR>
<BR>
Candy Kane - see my answer above - I was indeed going for something special.  And thanks.<BR>
<BR>
theSlayee - hehehe on the musician jokes.  And, I'm afraid I don't have very neaty taste in music.  Well, OK, if John Adams counts...<BR>
<BR>
Fly-by-Nite - please tell my wife that hottie part.  Sundance was very cool.  "Guinvere" has a very distinctive score that plays a prominent role in the film, and people seem to notice it.  I got to answer a couple of questions at the Q&A.  Very cool.<BR>
<BR>
Mary Loye - thank Sarah W and fax1 - I had nothing to do with it.  OK I guess I wrote it.<BR>
<BR>
Labyrnth - {vip rays your way}<BR>
<BR>
Angelic Sweetie - You're totally wrong.  It's the easiest thing in the world.  I'm not even kidding.  Anybody can do it.  Try it: get a keyboard.  Get a Buffy video, turn down the sound.  Wait until a scene looks creepy.  Play any two immediately adjacent notes on your keyboard, on some kind of sustaining sound (strings work good), pretty high up on the keybaord.  Voila!  Instant creepy music cue.  See?  If Joey can do it, ...<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - but it *is* Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
Everdawn - I just finished "Guinevere" which I'm EXTREMELY! excited about.  Very different from Buffy.  As always I've got my name in the pile on a few projects... nothing definite coming up, tho.  Which is fine... it's tough to do a film and Buffy at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
samantha - Thanks, and I think I should have a CD too.  Please start a record company and convince Fox to let you release one before the song CD comes out.  OK, that may be a big favor, but I'll buy you sushi.<BR>
<BR>
AngleMan - Thanks for posting that.  I actually saw that and was quite pleased.  Then again, what does he know?  :)  (If you're lurking, Alan, that was meant to be amusing)</SMALL>

Hey Shadowslayer - thanks for the compliment<BR>
<BR>
amika - Thanks.  I've worked on a bunch of TV shows of various quality, though I like to think they're all great (recently, Spy Game, FX: The Series, Two) and I'm trying to move into film work (recently: a couple of films that premiered at Sundance).  There are currently no plans for a score CD.  Though I would place better than even chances on there being one eventually, like 3 to 6 months after the song album is released, which by the way... was just pushed back to the fall.<BR>
<BR>
I think I'll interrupt myself to say that my wife kicks ass.  (I'm listening to the final mixes of her Taiwanese album as I type)...<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - OK, I'll let you know when I'm choosing Emmy stuff.  They make you pick in May, but if you have anything that airs after you pick, as long as it's before July, you can change your submission.  Hey, check this out - I had picked "Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered" last year, which was a week or so before I finished "Becoming Pt. 1" (which of course I eventually made my selection, thankfully)<BR>
<BR>
BuffySummers - see above for soundtrack info or lack thereof.  I get all my best ideas from my dog Joey who sings to me in my sleep.<BR>
<BR>
KiND - no kidding.  Know Lynda King?  David Grossman?  Didja know I did three sitcoms for Paramount?  (Most recently George & Leo)<BR>
<BR>
samantha - I will be at the PBP.  See you in 2000.  And I just finished "Bad Girls".  About to start "Consequences"... delays delays... looks like another really tight turnaround.  (This always happens in February it seems)<BR>
<BR>
Hollyn - re: doing music for "Angel" - I sure hope so.  I'd love to do the theme, and it looks like schedule-wise they go into production right after "Buffy" wraps, so I may have time (should Joss & David want me) to do the first bunch of eps.  I'm pretty sure I can't to both Buffy & Angel at the same time.  I'd end up with less of a life than I have even now...<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - It's a long story.  Turned the score around in 4 days.  Well, not that long really.  (It was especially tough cuz I used a lot of live percussion, which I normally don't do.)</SMALL>

Bruces Mom - For internal use I'm pretty sure the production staff uses the "c" spelling of prophecy.<BR>
<BR>
Rile - I hope to someday personally play in your head.  Sounds like a good venue.<BR>
<BR>
Paris_angel - re: bringing back the B/A theme... well, that didn't really count though, did it?<BR>
<BR>
Arymede - Does YTV suck?  Well, it must, so I'm in.<BR>
<BR>
Bruce's Mom - nope, that was Walter Murphy, who scored all of season 1.  Hey, bit of trivia:  Walter was recently featured on VH1's "Where are they now?" (didn't see it, someone told me about it, so I could be wrong about the title or channel) that was all about "Saturday Night Fever".  He arranged "A Fifth of Beethoven"... those of us born early enough will remember the disco version of the 5th... (He's probably <i>still</i> making money off that)<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - Yes I saw Loki.  She came to a screening of "Guinevere" and introduced herself afterwards.  I think she said she was going to the PBP...<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - there's a series underscore category.  My work on "Buffy" falls exclusively into this category.  I only get to pick one ep from the whole season.<BR>
<BR>
Aurorastar- yep it was a solo violin.  (It was fake tho - painstakingly crafted to sound as much like a real guy as possible - I knew it would just take too long to get a good performance for so much music)</SMALL>

<DD><BR>
EverDawn - very good question.  Here's my lengthy but not-so-good answer.<BR>
In an alternating-composer situation it's obviously desirable to share themes for continuity's sake.  But:  a) logistically it would be very difficult for composer A and B to learn and keep track of each other's themes (lord knows I have trouble myself, and I'm scoring them all this season); b) we composers are generally feircely competitive types and think we can always do it better than the other guy; c) <u>money money money money</u> any theme I use that's not mine, I gotta give away part or all of my royalties for that particular piece of music.<BR>
<BR>
you can see how c) could be a particularly motivating factor.  I try not to let it influence my decisions.  This season we've actually re-used one little bit of Sean & Shawn's music from Season 2 where it felt appropriate - when Spike came back at the beginning of Lover's Walk.  Since they wrote the original Spike Theme (School Hard) it felt right to use it again.  Granted that was only 10 seconds or so, so no big skin of my royalty-collecting back...<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of b).<BR>
How many composers does it take to change a light bulb?<BR>
<small>Ten.  One to change the bulb, nine to say "I coulda done that better".</small><BR>
<BR>
Dirty Socks - thanks.  Are you sure you're not dumb?  OK, I'll take the compliment.<BR>
<BR>
LadyJack - see you at the PBP.<BR>
<BR>
Gabi - how about this message... umm... happy birthday?<BR>
