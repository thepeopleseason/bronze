Wild Weasal - hi and bye<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - disagreeing with me by telling me you like my work is a pretty safe position to take with me, all things considered<BR>
<BR>
The vaedus - breathe<BR>
<BR>
RyanH - nope, didn't write it, at least that I can remember.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks everyone for the hang<BR>
- Chris

bec - and you know who I am now?  You just think you do.<BR>
<BR>
C/X don't really have a theme... unless you count that faux-romantic-overthetop string swells we used to hear whenever they kissed...<BR>
<BR>
Moshishi - I use Macs exclusively.  Count me in!  By the way 90% of the professional music community (at least in LA) is Mac bas<i></i>ed, if not more.  But chekc this out... on Monday I buy my first ever PC, to run some special software called Gigasampler that's gonna give me access to huge numbers of cool new sounds.  I'm so terrified of installation I hired someone to do it for me...<BR>
<BR>
SealedNFate - ha!  they're playing that on VH1?  I think I hear the sound of a soon-to-come royalty check in the mail.  Did you like it?  I had minimal involvement in that... 20 minutes or so of score (less than your average Buffy even, for a show twice as long) and was not involved in the songs.<BR>
<BR>
See?  That wasn't so bad was it?  I'm a nice person, at least when I'm not insulting Sarah W's opinions

David Fan - not to nitpick here but "You have the honor of being the next VIP I get to talk to on the board" is true for every VIP you talk to on the board, every time, no?<BR>
<BR>
<small>Oh, and I didn't write or pick "Full of Grace" either.   I just write the background (instrumental) music.</small><BR>
<BR>
Hi Moshishishishishishi, my non-gross love...<BR>
<BR>
KAM - hi<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo - been there done that (albeit recently)<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - I will never believe!  My cheeseometer does not lie.<BR>
<BR>
The vaedus - thanks, and at the risk of Beldin's ire may I say that I too recently rewatched Passion and was disappointed with my music under the big chase through the school.  It's not that I'm hyper-self-sritical... it's just that I don't realize that as I write each week I make little changes in my soudns or my st<i></i>yle, hopefully for the better, and sometimes I go back and look at my earlier work and just cringe.  Don't get me wrong, it's still one of my favorite episodes and I'm particularly fond of the Jenny theme.  If I do say so myself.  But that chase lacked... cahones?

Hey Curlysue and Nad.<BR>
<BR>
Monique - thanks for the compliments, and I'd be happy to be a VIP member of any and all of the clubs you mentioned.  As long as I don't have to make cookies for the meetings.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - you get to be exempted from the "I don't pay attention to anyone who liked the ending of WSWB" because, umm, you expressed your liking of the ending so eloquently?  And you didn't put it into a magazine for all to see?  And, well, just cuz you're so darn cute?  (out of ideas... sorry to offend you if I did)<BR>
<BR>
Hey Jimbo.  Busy no.  Hungry always.  Looking forward to breakfast.

Sorry, my spoilers are usually more specific (and I'm not even kidding about that).<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - spelled it right this time, and bye<BR>

Bye Meteor, hi Lady Pol<BR>
<BR>
AL24-7 - ah, but that's when she's most dangerous<BR>
<BR>
cycleboy and anyone else who cares - I happen to know for a fact that Evil Willow was saying "Oh, <b>fine</b>!" right after she got staked.  Y'all should take your filthy minds out of the sewers

keywe - luckily for me Jane didn't see that, or I'd be posting from Joey's house in the yard<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - no, it's not my usual time.  Variety is the spice of life.  Plus having nothing better to do.<BR>
<BR>
?, Monique - hi<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - Has Spectrum done any reviews of S3?  Not that I trust their opinion one iota, after saying they liked the end of WSWB...

<DD>Good morning Bronzers... <BR>
<BR>
Just saw a rough cut of "Enemies", and I've said this before, but I *really* mean it this time: avoid spoilers!  It's a great ep, and the fact that I was completely unspoiled when I sat down to waych made it twice as good.<BR>
<BR>
Joey/****zuh and Jane/wife say hi.<BR>
