<dd>Dobi--thanks.  :)<br><br>Zoni--forward's good.<br><br>Princess of Darkness--just used to seeing you over at my humble board.<br><br>Kestra--Hmm.  BBC project is called Ghosts of Albion.  It's a very complex online project.  And if it does well there, it may be translated to other media.  We'll be over in the UK soon to work on it.  The script is done.  More than that, I cannot say.<br><br>

<dd>Tiggy, MacPro, CarpeDi, Kestra, thanks.  :)<br><br>Old One--Amber and I are working on a project for the BBC right now.  Comics wise, there are possibilities, but they don't involve Buffy.<br><br>

<dd>PrincessofDarkness--hey!  :)  Weird seeing you here.<br><br>I'm gone . .<br><br>(but only in a Ty King kinda way, for those of you who've been around long enough to know what the hell I'm talking about)<br><br>

<dd>drlloyd--not a problem. I just figured if anyone was going to be arguing about what I said or meant, the easiest thing was for me to speak for myself.<br><br>Amber's the greatest.  One of the finest people I know.  But I don't want to be speaking for her, or getting involved in her business.  And nobody else should either.<br><br>Bullseye, sadly, once again I won't be at PBP. It's just never convenient.  My son's birthday and Valentine's Day always conflict with it.<br><br>

<dd>Bullseye & Miller's Angel.  :)  My pleasure.  I've been away too long.<br><br>Oh, and an aside to OzLady--the "river city" comment startled me.  Mainly cuz Lorne uses that same quote in Monster Island.  :)<br><br>

<dd>Hello All. Been ages and ages, but when I received OzLady's e-mail, I realized I couldn't stay away.<br><br>
First let me say that I have met and corresponded with a number of Kittens and have nothing but good things to say about them. This is a separate issue.<br><br>drlloyd wrote that:
***Two weekends ago Christopher Golden was a con in Boston. When asked about Amber not being on the show he indictaed her creative reasons and said, and I quote
"If you knew the whole story I have no doubt you would be on Ambers side" in response a womans question.***<br><br>This isn't exactly what I said. I said if you knew the whole story you would know whose side you were on. I'm not going to go much further than that here, except this--there's a difference between WHO the wronged party is and HOW they were wronged. Anyone who knows me can figure out who I think was wronged. The HOW is COMPLICATED. The constant speculation has been limited to simple explanations, but this is real life. Nothing is ever simple. And all the speculation is, well, it's kinda icky. Let it go. It's over.<br><br>drlloyd also wrote:
**He also said ME "lost" Amber, but "we" got her.**<br><br>I was talking about me and Tom Sniegoski. That AB wasn't going to be on Buffy anymore, but that Tom and I were writing the second Buffy video game, and that Amber was going to be doing her own voice for that. And that's ALL I was talking about. No agenda. No hidden meanings.<br><br>
