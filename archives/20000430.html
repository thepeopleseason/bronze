horizon - whoa!  stop!  I never said that I had an on camera appearance.<BR>
<BR>
Drubie - you can ask him if you want, but I'm pretty sure he made it up.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - Now do they really say howdy or are you just theorizing?  Cuz I haven't seen them in like, 4ever!  In any case howdy back.<BR>
<BR>
Amish Boy - if by "longer pieces" you mean "pieces of music not for TV or film" you are correct, but not the kind that would get published on sheet music (if that's what you mean).<BR>
<BR>
miremba - baby was due oct 9, now revised to oct 8.  Can't help you on the baby pool site though, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
clarrie - are we going to have this conversation entirely in your theoretical non-humiliating universe are can we just have it here in mortification central?<BR>
<BR>
To answer your question... as far as it affects me, I don't like it, because it decreases the likelihood of my music being commercially available.  But aside from selfish concerns I don't see it as an alarming trend.  If the best way to musically represent the movie (or sell a lot of records) is with a pile of songs, so be it.

His (as in plural of hi) to - Paris Angel, Lady Wolfsbane, Pooka<BR>
<BR>
Zelda - in television, the picture's always locked by the time I start working on it, because the deadlines are so tight to begin with, and the music is very closely timed to picture.  On a feature film though I often begin work to an unlocked edit.  Can be frustrating sometimes when they keep changing the picture.  Even a trim of a few frames here and there can throw off an entire music cue.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - Yeah, I'm trying to find a SPOILER FOR "RESTLESS" <s>Middle Eastern vocalist</s> SPOILER FOR "RESTLESS".  Other than that I got my hands full with 21.<BR>
<BR>
Joe the Owl - see below re location shooting.  I think it's UCLA but don't quote me on that.  And I do know they're doing less of it than they used to.  Especially since now they're on hiatus.<BR>
<BR>
buffluv - it's positively Buffalicious!

Ozlady - thanks, I'll be sure to pass on your buss to the Toddler-to-be.  Whatever a buss is.<BR>
<BR>
Amish - John King (music coordinator) helps choose the bands for Buffy & Angel, but final say goes to Joss and David Greenwalt.  And yes that was me in IOHEFY - so, damn cool cuz it was.<BR>
<BR>
Angelic one - see above, I don't pick the songs.  Betcha that little hole of yours is looking inviting huh?<BR>
<BR>
(uh OK anyone who takes the above post out of context 1) please see his post to me and 2) you thought it not me)<BR>
<BR>
Ron - Don't know what they told you, but... be vewwy vewwy quiet.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Spikey - despite the fact that I think you're thinking of a song I didn't write, I still say "poo" to your mom & dad, you can go tell them that Chris Beck says "poo".<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - <BR>
SPOILER (MUSICAL ONLY NO PLOT SPOILERS)<BR>
.<BR>
.<BR>
<small>Actually no.  The W/O was reprised from the big breakup in "Wild at Heart".  The W/T was a slightly modified version of the spell music from "Who Are You".  Entirely different, at least in theory.</small><BR>

horizon - Emmy submission is a two-stage process.  You have to choose an ep by March 31, with an option to replace it with an ep that aired anytime before May 31.  "Hush" is it for now.  Thinking optimistically (I won't start writing it for another half a week) Ep 22's should give "Hush" a run for its money, though.<BR>
<BR>
Cantriona, buffluv, FASTEDDIE, Boo - hi to you all.<BR>
<BR>
Angelic One - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Phantom Melody - nope, that's Robert Kral who does the scoring for Angel.  We worked together for the frist third of the season but since "Hero" he's been on his own.<BR>
<BR>
Joe the Owl - I remember Cop Rock.  Too hip for the room I guess!  The exterior shots of the campus are shot at UCLA, I believe, but they don't do that much anymore because I hear it's a pain in the arse too set up.  All the interiors as well as Sunnydale exteriors are shot on-site in soundstages or back lots.  And I work in my studio - I'm only ever on set if I'm visiting or shooting an on-camera appearance... lamentably that does not occur very often.<BR>
<BR>
Clarrie - what exactly would you like me to stuff?<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - you got some ears dontcha?  You are quite correct.  Sometimes in the throes of deadline-meetage and/or last-minute changes the most efficient way to solve problems is to toss in a pre-exisiting cue from an old show.  We try not to do it too often, and usually it isn't in a place as exposed as those creepy bathroom scenes were in WTWTA, but it's a necessary evil.<BR>
<BR>
Ummm, actually, what I mean is, I was purposely trying to draw a thematic connection between the rite of passage in "Helpless", and the "passage" to sexual excess in WTWTA.  You buyin' it?<BR>
<BR>
I want what Angle Man's been smoking.

Narrator - Phil Collins should do *all* the Buffy voices, using his considerable talents as a mimic to properly play all the characters.  However, if he's too busy with the inevitable aging-rock-star-post-mid-life-crisis symphonic piece for huge orchestra to do our little musical, I've heard the actual Buffy cast can all sing pretty good.  But that Tony Head has got some serious chops, don't he?  You'll be hearing more soon, I promise...<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie - serious answer here, yes I could not only cope, but I would *devour* an all-musical Buffy.  It would be an enormous amount of work, and would take some serious careful planning, but I hope it happens.  You just know Joss would come up with something incredible.

<DD>OK, real quick:<BR>
<BR>
<b>Squallster:</b>  Nah, we're just a band that was on in the first season.  We were in the Bronze, etc. during an episode called "Never Kill A Boy on the First Date."  They used two songs, one of which ended up on the Buffy Soundtrack CD.  (Yay!)  It's called "Strong."  The theme music is played by Nerf Herder, and it also available on the Soundtrack CD.  Check your local music store!  =)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Just had to say hi before I balied...  I'm fine, and no big news.  Glad you like the CD!  We'll begin promoting it to the industry next week.  Wish us luck!<BR>
<b>X-Lander:</b>  Sign me up!<BR>
RSO's to <b>Calen and FASTEDDIE!</b><BR>

I'm outta here...have a<BR>

First of all, here's our website.  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>  You can get downloads there, check out the new CD, see photos, video, read bios, reviews, etc.  It's pretty comprehensive.  It has clips from all out current releases ("Warm," "The Buffy EP," and "Moody Groove Music."), and has a fully stocked store where you can order anything you want.  (Completely secure.)  Check it out!  =)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Angeloudi:</b>  Hi, nice to meet you.  Repeating one song, eh?  Yeah, you might want to get that checked.  ;-)  Check out the site and hear the bass on the other songs...our bass player is the main songwriter, so they tend to ALL have cool bass lines.<BR>
<b>elusio:</b>  Hi!  Of course I rememebr you.  I may be sending you my hacked-up version of the lyrics very soon, actually.  Are you <i>completely</i> fluent?  'Cause there are a few words I don't have any idea how to spell, and you may look at them and say, "What they heck is she attempting to say there????"  ;-)<BR>
<b>TaraAnyaKate4eva:</b>  No, actually, I was in Atlanta doinbd a pitch for Turner (TBS, TNT, TCM, Turner South, etc...) with some friends.  An acting thing.  =)  If we tour, though, I'll keep that club in mind.<BR>
<b>Catriona:</b>  Good morning!<BR>
<b>Betty:</b>  No, you're not missing anything...our only major exposure in the UK has been our association with Buffy and our inclusion on the Soundtrack, which I believe is selling pretty well over there.  Go to the website to hear more!<BR>
<BR>
Really should get going...</i>

<DD><b>chi:</b>  LOL...it's called <b>"Moody Groove Music,"</b> and yes, you must get it!  It's our best CD to date, IMHO.  =)  The Amatomobile has been going through a phase, actually.  In the past 2 weeks, the alternator went out and had to be replaced, I got a blowout on the freeway and ended up replacing all 4 of my tires, I needed an alignment as well, and also new brakes!!  It's all done, now, so hopefully that'll be it for a while.  (And of course, all these things happened while I was on the road somewhere...they never happen close to home.  lol)  I'm on my way to FDS in about an hour...<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  Hi!  It's not that early...<BR>
<b>X-Lander:</b>  Cool!  Thank you very much.  =)<BR>
<b>Sweet J:</b>  Thanks; what a nice thing to say!  I'm fine, thanks.  Busy.

<DD>A few topics for <BR>
discussion before I go to work <BR>
today: (these will keep LIVELY <BR>
BANTER going on throughout the <BR>
day.  I'm here to HELP.)<BR>
<BR>
1) Who is Buffy's ONE TRUE LOVE? <BR>
(hint:  it's NOT Angel.)<BR>
<BR>
2)  Who is Willow's one true <BR>
love? (hint: it's Snyder.)<BR>
<BR>
3)  If Spike gets his chip out, <BR>
how long will it be before he <BR>
thinks to himself, "ah, ? sort of <BR>
miss that old chip of mine...."?<BR>
<BR>
4)  If Buffy slays all the <BR>
vampires in the world, do you <BR>
think she'll just be attacked by <BR>
NORMAL looking stuntmen?<BR>
<BR>
5)  If Xander grew to enormous <BR>
proportions, do you think he'd <BR>
add some suffix to his name, like <BR>
Xanderzilla or Xanderorbiton?<BR>
<BR>
6)  Why do Buffy's outfits always <BR>
look so pristine and perfect when <BR>
she's fighting, when they look so <BR>
stretched out and ugly on me?<BR>
<BR>
7)  Would you rather see A BLACK <BR>
AND WHITE Buffy, a MUSICAL Buffy, <BR>
a SOCK PUPPET Buffy, a <BR>
SMELLOVISION Buffy, or a musical <BR>
JAG with special guest Tommy Tune <BR>
as Colonel Tappy?<BR>
<BR>
8)  Is it me, or are Willow and <BR>
Tara kinda, you know...<BR>
<BR>
9)  You get to be a guest star on <BR>
Angel.  Describe your ideal role. <BR>
(Boys: the role of Buffy's ONE <BR>
TRUE LOVE is taken.  Back off.  <BR>
Just back away.  You don't wanna <BR>
hurt anybody with that thing.)<BR>
<BR>
10)  Why?  Oh God, WHY?<BR>
<BR>
11)  How often?<BR>
<BR>
!2)  Chafing is an issue that <BR>
affects millions of Americans.  <BR>
Where can I get help?<BR>
<BR>
13)  And finally, which <BR>
characters are going to die and <BR>
how is it funny?<BR>
<BR>
There now!  Lots of interesting <BR>
areas to discuss.  And you guys <BR>
thought I wasn't helpful.  Not <BR>
helpful, huh?  You BASTARDS!  <BR>
I'll show you not helpful!  Come <BR>
here.  COME HERE!  I'll give you <BR>
something to post about!  I... <BR>
I...  sorry.  Really.   It's this <BR>
outfit.  I look like a sausage.<BR>
