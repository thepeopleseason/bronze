<DD>Okay, bedtime.  Last things:  My next ep starts shooting tomorrow, is 16.  Another interesting challenge for me.  And yes, I'm co-scripting the Angel comic with Brett Matthews for a four ish arc, set it in a slightly different direction.  Plus FRAY (i'm behind on ish 3) and the whole staff (minus Marti but plus Amber!) is doing a compilation called Tales of the Slayers, each writer doing a Slayer from a different era, and Dark horse is hooking us up with some SERIOUS artists.  Comics are fun but now I have to sleep and then run two shows.  Remember that each and every one of you is special, except the people from Clambentown, you all stink.<BR>

<DD>As to the show being ruined if it went to FOX  (Which I doubt it would), well the head of the Fox network is Gail Berman, who did come up with the idea of making Buffy into a TV show...  I don't poke my head into the business world too much.  All I care about is making the show.  And naked stuff.

<DD>Actually have to bail in a min, need sleep.  But I did see the ABC mention -- I didn't love the sexual reference, clever though it was.  I'm overprotective.  Finding out that EDWARD GOREY was a Buffy fan, now that made my life.  Anyhoo, I just wanted to say hey and yes that was Anne, and yes she had the huge tat removed cuz she's independent now.  Which I love.  The strength she's gained over her incredibly spread out arc... it's what the shows are all about.  And  Julia is a sweetie.  She'll be back.  (Though working with Julie, Julia and Juliet was kind of a strain).

<DD>No, I didn't go to the globes or the WB party -- I, er, wasn't invited.  Oh Well.  As for Sarah's comment, no comment.  I wish I had something juicy to share with you all, but apart from a prodigeous amount of phlegm (colds never go away)  I got nothing.
