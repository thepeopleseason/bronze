<DD>And then my color <BR>
fails.  Sigh.  (sound of me <BR>
sighing).  Well, I'll just go.  <BR>
By the way, I do think <BR>
nightcrawler should be in the <BR>
sequel, and I happen to know a <BR>
Seth greens shaped man that <BR>
want's to play him.  (I think <BR>
he's just greedy for more action <BR>
figures of himself.)  As for the <BR>
green man's return to Buffy, I <BR>
can promise you that he and <BR>
willow will DEFINITELY have some <BR>
scenes together.<BR>
<BR>
Well bye.<BR>
<BR>
"Judy Garland Uber Alles..."<BR>
<BR>
Stop that!  I heard that!<BR>

<DD><green64>Riley's Girl, why thank <BR>
you, you are clearly my very <BR>
favorite fan who.... wait a <BR>
MINUTE!  Didn't you post that <BR>
post I didn't like?  You did, you <BR>
made that bigotty post and then <BR>
TRICKED me into liking you, I've <BR>
been a FOOL, a FOOL... base <BR>
flattery and I FELL for it...<BR>
<BR>
actually i'm really glad you like <BR>
the show.  I'm against <BR>
intolerance of any kind, but if I <BR>
only made a show for people with <BR>
the exact same opinions as me, <BR>
I'd have a pretty teeny audience.  <BR>
So welcome.  The whole point of <BR>
Buffy is to be inclusive to those <BR>
who feel excluded (like gay teens <BR>
and, right now, like Riley's <BR>
Girl.  (But no Nazis.  i'm <BR>
serious about that.)<BR>

<DD>La Dame Rouge, you <BR>
bring up a very interesting point <BR>
about vampires of diferent <BR>
religions not fearing crooses.  <BR>
For my own part, I'd just like to <BR>
add:  SHUT UP!  You think it <BR>
isn't hard enough, figuring out <BR>
this mythology crap, you gotta <BR>
bring that up?  Aggg!  Stupid <BR>
crosses!  They were in the <BR>
stories, okay, and we hadda use <BR>
'em and now i'm always worried, <BR>
how do I explain crosses working <BR>
on all vampires, maybe no one <BR>
will notice and I can just NOT <BR>
MENTION IT!!! But NOOOO, you had <BR>
open your big YAP!<BR>
<BR>
Actually, during my little rant I <BR>
came up with the answer.  It <BR>
isn't the person who reviles the <BR>
sybol of the Christian God, it's <BR>
the demon that possesses them.  <BR>
Whew!<BR>
<BR>
It's cool.  We're cool.<BR>

<DD>What's a mirror stage?  <BR>
What's a Lacan?  I am not with <BR>
the book learning.  But I am <BR>
irresistably freckly!  And <BR>
Cononical!<BR>

<DD>Well, before I go <BR>
change my name, I'd like to point <BR>
out that I'm canonical.  <BR>
CANONICAL, DO YOU HEAR?!?!?<BR>
<BR>
That's the coolest thing since <BR>
someone wrote I was skinny.<BR>
<BR>
As for X-men, they didn't take <BR>
out any characters.  The major <BR>
structural loss was the DANGER <BR>
ROOM, which I incoporated <BR>
heavily.<BR>
<BR>
NO GAY NAZIS!<BR>

<DD>I knew I'd mistype my <BR>
name sooner or later.  Now I <BR>
guess I'll have to change it.  <BR>
Oops.<BR>

<DD>Sorry, guys, I just had the time to say "hey."<BR>
<BR>
And maybe a few hellos...<BR>
<BR>
Hi, Carrie.  Breaking my heart with your anecdote.<BR>
<BR>
ergo sum - I've said too much all ready. :-)<BR>
<BR>
Hi, cats, Kenickie...<BR>
<BR>
We're on hiatus, folks.  That means there's no real grind until the end of May.  (Though we voluntarily get together with Joss to talk about stuff for next season)<BR>
<BR>
I'm GOOSEBUMPS movie rewrite guy during the next month.
