<DD> I have to go for dinner. Local Italian - love it. <BR>
Swoop: Favorite vamp - vewry hard. I love David B so doing his make-up is a pleasure, but that's just personal. I love James Marsters too - and his make-up is great fun. But I guess putting Alyson into vamp was my favorite...but then...<BR>
Lurking b: No contest - ADAM. Very hard work.<BR>
WiccaWillow: No P. <BR>
Night all. I f I don't post again before. I'll see you at the PBP!

AngleMan: Well, I'll join to support the show - but anyone who makes me get up at 345 am to do a make-up is a little suspect....<BR>
Lovely Poet: Hi<BR>
Ivy: And I'll show you mine...I have my business logo of a bat and a rose on my leg. The Bat for "special make-up" and the rose for "beauty".<BR>
Jay: Yes, continuity is a part of my job.And before you attack - rmrmber that in the mad rush of tv filming lots of things are not easy to control. Both Joss and Sarah wanted the bites to fade away - gone as a story point, gone for real. As for Angel's tattoo, it sits so far in on the shoulderblade that a t-shirt - even sleeveless - doesn't show it. It is there anytime the shirt is off. We're pretty careful about stuff.<BR>
Mesuvius: The gentlemen were 5 hours too. rough.<BR>
Starr: Yes I do the beauty stuff as well. As do all the people I hire for the show. I make it a point as I believe a make-up artist should be well rounded and able to do anything. That's necessary in tv anyhow...

Angus: Books on film make-up are rare. Usually outdated. Try a really good basic Stage make-up book, or "The Technique of Film and Television Make-up" By Vincent J-R Keyhoe. Good Luck<BR>
WiccaWillow: E-mail me and we can talk. Too much for the board. E-mail:P Noz4atu@aol.com<BR>
Loyus: Yes I was a bigh Drak Shadows and Star Trek fam - that started me out. But remember, I don't really design the Buffy make-ups. Joss and Optic Nerve do thet. Optic Nerve has a great sculptewr working for them who does a lot of the actual construction: John Whedon (no relation).<BR>
Swoop: Holding a dance. I don't dance...did you see the last Angel...well, I'm less funny...<BR>
Claris: Re Joss's cameo on Angel. You'll have to ask the skin-peelers...I mean make-up artists for that show, I don't do Angel. By the way, the two make-up artists from Angel, Dayne Johnson, and David De Leon will be in attendance this year at the PBP.<BR>
\Angel: Unfortunately I didn't hear about the auction this year untill too late. I'll see if anything turns up this week, otherwise I have nothing to contribute.<BR>
Chi: All the suits are constructed for as much roughand tumble as they can stand, wether stunt or not, however, they are just rubber suits and the guys wearing them do need to take the most care of them that they can. Yes, it is a conscern.

<DD>Please forgiove the delays as I try to answer you all. Hi's to SteveFaith/ Maryloye/mudpuppy<BR>
Swoop: I never participate in the clubs - time restrictions - but you may list me if you like. I have given an interview to Christopher, so I hope to be in the book!<BR>
Yes Ivy, I remember you. Did you find out anything?<BR>
Devil: Most of the design is done with Joss and Optic Nerve, my part is application and painting. But I have pretty wide scope with that and change things as they need to be altered (but always with Joss's ok).<BR>

<DD>StrangeOne: Thanks! Adam is a real process. Try as we might we can't get the make-up done in loess than 5 hours! I have to do it again Monday morning! I haven't visited the board in a while as our hours have been pretty bad. As you know we get about 9 hours off between shooting days and that makes for about 5 - 6 hours sleep a night.

<DD>So.  Talk of Buffy and Angel.  What I should do with them.  Will they get back together.  This irritates me greatly, because it's clearly impossible for them to get back together because they're BOTH GAY NOW!  Didn't you people read my post last week?  Sheesh!  Why do I bother?<BR>
<BR>
The truth is, even I don't know everything that will happen.  But I do know that Buffy and Angel are on different shows, shows that have to work independantly of each other.  Their romance is timeless and whatnot, and I'll wring it for every bit of pain and exultation that I can, but the fact is they do have to get on with their lives, at least for now.  We all do.  If i had one, i'd be getting on with it right now.  <BR>
<BR>
Oh, and kill Xander?  Never.  Absolutely never.  Unless it was funny.  And probably not even then.

<DD>Thoin - I put my email addy on this post.  So if you want to click on it later and e me maybe we can talk some on the best way for us to handle this stuff and promote our work without offending or putting out any wrong info.  Thanks in advance.<BR>
<BR>
But don't worry about BUFFY turning into POWER RANGERS.  Joss is dead-set against that.  He'll take care of it if any of us on either show start to veer too far off the mark.  Buffy/Angel are both different shows each with its own feel, but neither will ever be a kiddie show as long as Joss is around.  I promise.<BR>
<BR>
joe - As far as the lighting goes:  I understand what you are saying.  We sometimes say the same thing, but the D.P. has decided that's the way he wants it to be and I know it does add to the feel of the show.  There are times when I wish we could show the intricate moves better than we do.  Sometimes it's just time limits.  But I understand what you mean about the darkness of it.  Hard to see at times.<BR>
<BR>
spookkidd - none<BR>
<BR>
So thank you all for the kind words and the understanding about all of this.  If I didn't think that most of you could handle it I wouldn't bother talking to you about it.  I consider the people here to be friends.<BR>
<BR>
I gotta run and pick up some equipment now.  You guys have fun.  <BR>

<DD>Kristen - Yeah.  You do have a point there.  As much as I consider the people at the bronze to be just personal friends who share an insider appreciation for the show, I also saw what happens with any little joke that Joss may make.  It gets all blown out of proportion and printed elsewhere out of context.  Once Joss was in a bad mood and made some brief comment and that was sent around the globe.  It was amazing all the varied opinions read into it and what he "really" meant.  <BR>
<BR>
That kind of thing has happened here with me too.  Someone showed me a site in England that said something about a "Pruitt Expose'" coming out.  That was in relation to the comment that I'd made about maybe writing a book about my experiences.  Some thought, "Oh boy.  Tell all."  Others thought, "That basterd!  He's writing one onf those tell-alls about my SMG and no one knows her the way I do.  I must go to Hollywood and kill this guy."  But really I only meant that I might one day write about my life behind the scenes in the crazy world of stunts.  Sure actors are in there, but that's not all there is.  Sheesh.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Don't come to Hollywood and kill me.  My writing is not so good that you should be concerned  with it anyhow.

<SMALL>(Sat Feb 12 15:20:25 2000 169.132.153.158)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Thoin - What happened was:  Sophia got a memo from the WB saying that they wanted her to do an interview with this magazine about her training.  So she did.  They kept trying to get Sophia to comment on Sarah and she refused.  She told them they'd have to talk to Sarah's people.  Sophia checked to make sure after the third conversation with them that the article was about only her training and she made it clear that she'd been told NOT to talk about Sarah - only herself.  They agreed.  Later they told her that the editor wanted an article on Sarah too, but that they'd do one on Sophia and the one on Sarah on opposite pages.  Sophia sent them training pics and gave them the quotes they wanted.  The publicist at the WB confirmed that they understood that she was not Sarah's trainer and that her job was doing the fights and stunts on the show.  That's all.<BR>
<BR>
The article came out and ... no pics of Sophia.  Just her quotes about herself that make it sound as if she trains Sarah to do the fights.  That's what we call lying where I come from.  I guess that was the plan from the start.  Nothing like seeing yourself used, eh?  Again.

<DD>Slave2Faith - Exactly.  I work for FOX.  So for me to stand up and say in print that I think that they should back off this website thing is pretty brutally honest and even gutsy (fi I do say so myself)<BR>
<BR>
I remember when I was working out in the hot sun creating fight scenes for the little kids on POWER RANGERS.  I got a page.  It was from a voice I didn't know.  The voice said that he saw that I'd had my photo taken with the Rangers and that was not allowed.  I asked why.  He said because, "that makes it appear as if somehow the Power Rangers endorses you."  Can you believe that?  I'd shot nearly a hundred episodes and helped them to make over a billion dollars in a 12 month period (according to Wall Street Journal).  I was making up half the show everyday off the top of my head and shooting 70 set-ups with a single camera every day of the week.  It became a phenom and some guy that's never even been to the set is telling me that I can't have my picture taken?  Later the guy who was in the White Ranger suit got a call for the same thing.  He was going to write them a check for $10,000 because they threatened him.  I stopped him and told them to bite my butt.  Next thing you know little ten year old kids are telling me that they've been threatened because they had a Pink Ranger web site.<BR>
<BR>
If someone is stealing tapes or scripts that's one thing.  But fans who love a show and promote the hell out of it is a good thing.  Am I right?  So please bosses who may be watching me now.  Let my people go.<BR>
<BR>
Okay then.

<DD>Angleman - I know.  I was just so afraid (from what I'd read and friends had e'd to me) that some people got the wrong impression and thought that I didn't like Fury or something.  No way!  I respect that guy so much it's not even funny.  Any you all know that I always tell the truth.  If I don't like somebody they know it.  But I've always said that our writers rule the universe and it's true.  I am amazed at what they do.  They are the best you will ever see.  Period.<BR>
<BR>
My only fear is if Joss leaves.  That's the time when I might really not want to work on the show anymore.  It scares me to think of what the show could become.  I think that's why he's working so closely with Marti, Fury, Jane, Petri and everyone.  I think he wants to be sure that he can walk away for two seconds to do something and know that the show will stick to his vision of it.  It honestly is the only way to go for me.  And you know I wouldn't say that stuff if I didn't back it up every single day.<BR>

<DD>It is true that Sophia feels like John Elway.  No Phil, not in a physical way... I mean she is all bruised and banged up all the time... you knew that - right?<BR>
<BR>
Don't worry though.  Things aren't that bad.  Just because of a long rough day and a few mean people.  Even they are not mean all the time.  We really do have fun more than the rest of the crew and I know that.  I'm grateful about it.  The majority of the crew have exactly zero days off, whereas I sometimes have a day or two during the week to myself.  That makes all the difference.  Sometimes I don't know how they keep going the way they do.

<DD>Oh and btw - I know I've said this already, but please don't anyone get the wrong idea and think that I have anything against Fury just because I tried to clear up that info about how the fights are choreographed.  I never thought that he was trying to imply that he choreographed the fights or anything like that.  I knew that he was talking about the specifics that had to do with the intercutting and the story.  I was only trying to explain what I did that night so people wouldn't get the wrong impression about how the fights get made.  <BR>
<BR>
Salve2Faith - It still amazes me how they just lie to you at magazines.  The PEOPLE magazine reporter swore to Sophia that the article there was about stunts.  The FITNESS person called her three times at least and everyone told her that they were doing an article on her stunts and training.  She had already told all these people that she was not going to talk about Sarah and that they would have to talk to Sarah's publicist if they wanted any info about her.  They just flat out lied to her.  Multiple times.  <BR>
<BR>
X-Lander - Thanks for that and I'll be seeing you at the PBP.

<DD>Hello PB-<BR>
<BR>
Just wanted to pop in to say thanks for all the nice emails I've gotten after I spouted off about work the other day.  Sometimes I forget that it's easier for others to come on and talk about someone being nasty to them on the job and it's just normal, but if I do it myself, some people seem really affected.  Some even get upset at me as if I'm somehow attacking the show they love or something.  Yes, the meaness and sneakiness of a few people on the crew does get to me sometimes, but most aren't involved in that stuff and have nothing to do with it.  And we can handle it like we always do.   We've had to deal with our own version of nasty office politics just as many others have had to. I'm sure everybody has some tale to tell.  I just forget that  people seem to react more to mine because they connect it to the show that they seem to feel connected to.<BR>
<BR>
It is true that Sophia has told me that she doesn't want to go back next season, but I am working on her.  I know that many on the crew are really tired right now and talking that way too.  You can't blame them.  It's not a 9 to 5 existence around here and nerves get frayed after a few months.  In the end whatever Sophia wants to do is fine with me.  I stick by her and go with her either way.  I'm hoping that between myself and some of the nice people at work that we'll be able to make her feel better soon.  Some of you have possibly felt the same way at times I'm sure.  I just won't talk about that stuff around here anymore.  I really don't mean to upset anyone.<BR>
<BR>
The director who was nasty to the stunt people went for a walk with me last night and he apologized for the way he'd behaved.  He told me that as a director he'd gotten used to being able to get away with being sarcastic sometimes and he was sorry.  He promised not to act that way again.  So that made things much better.<BR>
<BR>
You all know how I feel about getting respect for the work that stunt people do for the industry.  Nothing's changed there.  I'll try not to cram it down anyones throat who doesn't want to hear it.  It's just that when someone brings the subject up to me I try my best to answer honestly.  That's a subject that means a lot to me as I'm sure you can understand.<BR>
<BR>
On the bright side of things:  I'll bring a tape to play at the PBP again this year of stunts behind the scenes.  That way you can see that we really do still have fun in spite of anything.  I think you'll get a kick out of it (no pun intended)<BR>
<BR>
thanks,<BR>
<BR>
