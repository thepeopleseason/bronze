research-girl  - As of now there's a likely possibility of a score-only CD six months or so after the song CD is out.  That could still be a while...  Speaking of which TVT is considering putting a piece or two of score on the song CD.  You can write to TVT records (www.tvtrecords.com) if you want to show support for that.<BR>
<BR>
Jubilee - you confusing it with Maverick's latest fic maybe?  I heard I have a shirtless cameo in it.<BR>
<BR>
AjO - thanks

BtVSChick - thanks<BR>
<BR>
SpookyMagoo- My dog joey hums softly to me as I sleep.  They say shih tzus are a musical breed.  And unfortunately the only work ritual that comes to mind is smoking cigarettes!  (Quit for a week now, trying again)</SMALL>

AjO - I was a bit underwhelmed by the score, as I was with the movie itself.  "Duel of the Fates" is the exception - I think it positively rocks.  And JW on a bad day is still JW after all.<BR>
<BR>
Digital grand - hi<BR>
<BR>
elusio - I will definitely do both series at first but at some point this season I will hand off composing duties to another composer so I can focus on "Buffy" and have time for one or two other projects.<BR>
<BR>
Charity - thanks - I intend to<BR>
<BR>
Kristen - congratulations, I still haven't seen it but there's a copy waiting for me at my studio first thing tomorrow AM.<BR>
<BR>
Strawberries - you mean the pseudo-Irish-fiddle viola thingie at the opening there?  Thanks, and it's a live viola over an electronic simulation of an orchestra.

AjO - Yeah I think they started shooting the first ep last week.  Probably finishing Wednesday?  Good luck with the audition.  Kick Leo's ass!<BR>
<BR>
WiddleOne - Thanks<BR>
<BR>
Jubilee- LOL!  Who told you that?!  (Uhh, that's a negato on the cameo)</SMALL>

Kristen - looks like you'll have no problem ensuring Joss sees the article (or receives the framed copy)  :)<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie - OK sign me up.<BR>
<BR>
Monique - No, I won't be starting on that for another month.  I am still working on the theme however (OK so I don't have four weeks *totally* off).
