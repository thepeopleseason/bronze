<dd><b>Algerina, Beldin, valMichael:</b>  Thanks!  It's a role in a new musical they're doing out here at the Odyssey Theatre.  (Great theatre, always does good work.)  The show's called "Madly In Love," and it focuses on three iconic couples from history/literature.  Romeo and Juliet, Lancelot and Guinevere, and King Edward (or should I say, Edward Windsor...poor guy, abdicating his throne and all) and Wallis Simpson.  I play Wallis, the Duchess of Windsor.  It's going to be fun!<br><br>Anyway, it look slike I have to jet now, too.  (Going over to the studio to listen to some new tracks.)  But I'll try and stop by later!<br><br>See ya!<br><br>~Erika<br><br>
