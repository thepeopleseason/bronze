<DD>Gettin' towards <BR>
bailage time.  Scarlettharlett, <BR>
you think we've been tiptoeing?  <BR>
Sounded more like clogdancing to <BR>
me.  Did you see that spell?  Do <BR>
i have to "Spell" it out for you?  <BR>
(jokes like that, no wonder i'm a <BR>
FAMOUS TELEVISION PERSONALITY).  <BR>
They're sweeties, no way around <BR>
it.  (unless you're little, and <BR>
not ready for that concept, in <BR>
which case they're BESTEST <BR>
friends.)

<DD>Shadow, i think it's <BR>
a little unfair to say I "adore <BR>
the attention".  I think "crave" <BR>
is probably a better word....  A <BR>
question about my vampire <BR>
theories?  I should have done <BR>
this a while ago,  but here's a <BR>
short bibliography of influential <BR>

<DD>Jimbo -- just went to <BR>
your 'sketchpad'.  YOU CALL THOSE <BR>
DRAWINGS?  I call them  <BR>
"Hoonerbies".  Drawings are <BR>
hoonerbies and paintings are <BR>
"remgobs".  You made very good <BR>
hoonerbies.<BR>
<BR>
Favorite ABC...<BR>
<BR>
Promethea is visionary, but TOP <BR>
TEN gets me more involved than <BR>
anything, and edges the goddess <BR>
out.<BR>

<DD>Okay.  I'm pretty sure <BR>
both cool vampire guy and the <BR>
pretentious brandy having Joss <BR>
are gone.  For now.  I, normal, <BR>
even tempered, MARRIED (just back <BR>
off ladies, this fine man is <BR>
SPOKEN FOR), humble, chisled, <BR>
delusional Joss am back.  And I <BR>
have a legitimate question.  (The <BR>
tables are turned, no?)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What's a Bram Stoker award?<BR>

<DD>I don't see how I (a <BR>
famous television personality) <BR>
could possibly take the time to <BR>
say "hi" or "hello" or some such <BR>
to Drubie, and PLEASE don't <BR>
infect me, but I suppose, if it's <BR>
good for the "common man" image, <BR>
hello.  Personally I'm much more <BR>
interested in the subject of Lady <BR>
Wolfbane's lapdance.<BR>

<DD>Well, clearly there's <BR>
been a teensy mix up.  I want to <BR>
assure you all that I am not in <BR>
any way associated with rather <BR>
illiterate "cool vampire guy".  I <BR>
am, after all, a famous <BR>
television personality and would <BR>
never stoop to assuming a false <BR>
name just to drool over hot girls <BR>
and flame our dear friend <BR>
Aardwolfe.  So, in summation, <BR>
cool vampire guy: not me.  Very <BR>
sorry.<BR>

<SMALL>(Fri Mar 24 17:59:04 2000 152.163.197.64)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Uh, I think they woud sleep with <BR>
Faith becuz faith woud offer to <BR>
sleep with them and whereas with <BR>
buffy she woud say no.  All so <BR>
faith has evilness, she is bad <BR>
wich clearly says that she woud <BR>
sleep with you.  buffy is good <BR>
and woud not have the sex out of <BR>
wedlock except if the story calld <BR>
for it.<BR>
<BR>
I all so think that faith is hot <BR>
whereas buffy is hot also but the <BR>
boys woud be shy with her becuz <BR>
she has her own show --<BR>
<BR>
--Joss?  Is that you?<BR>
