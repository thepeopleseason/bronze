<dd>Micheal 7770: Stuntman Mike Massa ( who doubled Angel in "Surprise")<br>
<br>
Ty: The fight was only fair in my opinion. My favorite bit was the build up to it. that makes the fight and can only come from a great script and director. Nothing I can do without that. I loved the scene with Giles when he learned that Jenny was dead. OHMYGOD!<br>
<br>
Sonja Marie: Tony and his stunt double Doggie Conna both worked in that fight. (*Doogie also fought Kendra in the storeroom as Angel)<br>

<dd>JEFF - - To continue gushing... I thought the blending of stunt folk with David, Sarah and Tony was absolutely seamless. Especially that Sarah was able to deliver a couple of kicks full face to the camera. And, all this with fire all around, no less. How much did the fire contribute to the overall difficulty, by the way?<br>

<dd>Brad: Thanks. Mike Gershman told me that he wanted to try to stop by tonight if he got away from the set in time. He just couldn't make it home in time I guess. I'll give him your comments though.<br>
<br>
Barnabas: We shoot in Super 16 using Panavison cameras. I'll have to ask the Gersh Man which stock he prefers for the interiors.<br>
<br>
Ty: One of my favorite things that you put into the script was changed (as I was afraid it would be) The picture of the BE-HEADED JENNY *** shudder***<br>

<dd>JEFF! Oh, man, wow! I hadn't seen it the last time we spoke. Wow! To me, the fight sequences were the climax. That was the ultimate expression of all the passion of the ep. These sequences were so different from past ones in that it seemed that each blow was cathartic and packed so much. Wow! From now on, only "they fight" from me.<br>

<dd>WHELK - - To answer your question about the blunt instrument: a line Joss wrote, and (I think) got cut was delivered right after Angel, in the middle of getting wailed on by Giles, said "Geez, what ever happened to wooden stakes?" Giles' (edited out) reply: "They don't hurt enough."<br>
<br>
Cool line.<br>

<dd>Hey Whelk: The script in "Surprise" originally said that Buffy opens the door to the truck and stakes the Vamp behind the wheel before he can move and then add fight/fight/fight if time permits. If you've seen the show you'll know that much more happened than what was written. Heck - on some shows I've done they just started writing ADD PRUITT FIGHT SCENE - APPROX. 3 MIN.<br>
<br>
I have never done a fight exactly according to what was written in the script. Ty and the guys at BUFFY are hip to that. Usually what sounds wonderful to a writer on paper looks pretty lame in real life. That's why they hire someone who specializes in that kind of action for film. You wouldn't believe what goes into making an action scene work.<br>
<br>
THANKS TY. (How many others in town would give their stunt coordinators credit? Not many.... er uh .... any.) <br>

In case anyone wonders, I loved the character of Jenny Calendar. And Joss created her. When a (great) writer like Joss makes a decision to kill one of his children/characters, it is not an off-hand or flippant decision. And for those who label it a cop-out, I find it one of the bravest decisions, to sacrifice a great character you have created for the greater good of the dramatic and character arcs of the show. The easy thing is to stick with the popular status quo. As I have said before, I was skeptical when Joss killed the Master, but the arrival of Dru and Spike made that decision look like genius. I would never have been brave enough to make the decision he did about Angel/Angelus, but my favorite eps have been Innocence and BBB, both post bad Angel shows. I predict the death of Jenny will take the series to a fever pitch. This was not the easy choice, but time will show that it was a brilliant choice (just the latest of many by Joss and Company).<br>
<br>
Call me a fan of Joss' genius.<br>
<br>

<dd>Sparkita - - I think I told Roanna, all I want to come to the PBFP is directions.<br>
<br>
And, so I can stop kicking myself, I want to thank Michael Gershman, who made some brilliant choices that I didn't even imagine when I wrote the script. And thanks to Jeff, who once again took "they fight" and turned it into a pugilistic ballet full of the characters' passion, as befit the episode. The rage that the characters brought into the battles drove the action, and was wonderful. The fights became some of the most powerful character statements of the ep.<br>
<br>
And, of course, to David and Tony (who made me look like a writer), Sarah, Nick, Aly (who made me cry), Kristine, Charisma, James and Juliet... it never sounded or looked this good in my head. You guys found laughs, tears, sighs and gasps in the words that I know I didn't put there.<br>
<br>
And again, to Joss, the voice-over idea was genius.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the belatedness of the kudos to the crew who make Buffy THE show.<br>
<br>
That's it. <br>
<br>

<dd>Now might be a good time to say I was kidding about "Dawson's Creek." I did watch some of it tonight, but my intentions were not the purest.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry Joss wasn't well enough to come on the board tonight and take the bows that belong to him.<br>

<dd>Had to say again to Joss, if you're out there... thanks. The silk purse out of a sow's ear thing still holds - even more so. Any kudos for "Passion" should go to Joss. Give me the assist (I'll take it).<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Now, who wants to talk about tonight's "Dawson Creek"?<br>

<dd>Skyler - - Oh, yeah. Forgot about the tidbit. It's just a little thing, but I hope you recorded the ep to go back for it...<br>

Okay - near the end, there is a nice little bit of instrumental music with a low, humming sort of male voice playing under Giles' return to his apartment, Buffy and Giles at the the cemetery, etc. Well, the humming voice on the soundtrack is provided by none other than our own favorite singing Librarian/Watcher. Picked that up at the final editing session.<br>
<br>
Tony sings!<br>
<br>
That was it.<br>
<br>
END OF SPOILER - END OF SPOILER<br>
<br>
<br>
END OF SPOILER<br>
<br>
PS - Joss came up with the main story point for "Passion" as we walked and brainstormed together through the cemetery set. Gotta love a good thoughtful spot. And a genius like Joss who can come up with this stuff.<br>

<dd>Just on long enough to say "Kudos" to Joss, and thanks for letting me keep my name on the script.<br>
<br>
That's it. Good night.<br>
