<b>Alex:</b>  I know, but we're concentrating on recording new material.  Sorry. =(<BR>
<b>Buffy S:</b>  Why, thank you.  No, they just took a few different camera angles of us.  I basically just did what I do on stage.  Although it was strange, since we were lip-synching to ourselves...and then they'd turn the music OFF when the actors would have to speak, and we'd keep groovin' along, trying to stay in time...

<DD><b>VT:</b>  E- received, and Cool! =)<BR>
<b>RJ:</b>  Ack.  They <i>were</i> available at Tower, Best Buy, etc. but I hear they're getting harder to find.  You can always order them from us.  E-mail me if you need more info.<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>  No problem. Sarah's been out of the band for about 6 months.  We had a new keyboardist/DJ - a guy - and although he's good, he's not as disciplined as we'd like.  so we're looking for a replacement.<BR>
<b>Dru:</b>  Nope, not for a while.  Wish we were going to tour sooner.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, glad you're doing better.

<b>Redeyed Student:</b>  Well, we usually play Club181, but we're open to new venues.  Think they'd like us at Slim's?

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  It was OK, thanks.  How was yours?<BR>
<b>Fax1:</b>  Well, I have no idea, really.  Probably sometime in '99.  And the new band members are working out GREAT.  We're still in the market for a keyboard player, though, so if anyone knows anybody in L.A.....<BR>
<b>Kara:</b>  You're probably right.  I'll throw something together.

Hi, <b>Haven!</b><BR>
<b>RedeyedStudent:</b>  Actually, that is pretty likely.  We play in SF from time to time.  We're not gigging anywhere 'til after Christmas, though.  Check out our site, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">Velvet Chain</a>, for gig dates, etc. =)<BR>
