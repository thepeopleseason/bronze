Can you believe this internet "Cafe" has no bathroom?  They serve coffee and soft drinks.  Do they think we're camels?<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - LOL!  As I eat my breakfast roll I fantasize about Cap'n Crunch.  It kinda works.  And tell Jamie Kellner to turn up the music a bit OK?  All you can hear is the SPOILER slurping! SPOILER<BR>

Lilith - first Barcelona, then Seville (4 days each) then a quickie trip up to Bilbao to check out the Guggneheim.<BR>
<BR>
SpookyMagoo - he's actually at a Kennel where he gets to sleep in the trainer's house.  There's a kennel in LA we considered (Chateau Marmutt) that was web cams in each living area so you can check up on your dog.  Expensive though.

Paris Angel - you get to live up to your name!<BR>
<BR>
Willow Worshipper - The answer is yes.  There is a minute possibility that they could have made changes to the show since the Canada airing.  But I'd be extremely surprised... I'm sure it would be all over the media if that were the case.  Joss did make (very) minor changes in two places to accomodate the WB before it aired anywhere and I'm sure that's the version that will be shown on Tuesday.<BR>

hi justLURKing, Kenickie<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - England is cool.  And thanks for the encouragement...<BR>
<BR>
PDR - What, are you gonna come down and buy me dinner?  I'm at easyEverything accross from Victoria St. station, but not for long.

Narrator - I ended up picking GD1.  Thanks for the kind words.  (%$!! British keyboards)<BR>
<BR>
redruM, Vaal, Blackheart, WtW, WWorshipper - hi<BR>
<BR>
SpookyMagoo - Joey... Joey... Omigod!  Joey!  Uhh..<BR>
<BR>
DingoBaby - I'm in London for two days, in transit between Berlin (where we spent some time with my Brother who lives there) and Spain (where we're going tomorrow) for a wedding.  Back in L.A. in ten days or so.
