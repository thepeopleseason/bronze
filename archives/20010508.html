<DD>okay, first of all, there will be no awe-shivering, nor will there be any "gracing" of anything.  anyone who knows me knows the word "grace" is an almost grotesquely inappropriate sobriquet.  also, i (*cough*)... i think i just inhaled my dictionary.  <BR>
<BR>
hi <b>Rob</b>!  just wanted to say hi!<BR>
<BR>
now me and bed.  going.  together.  like a date.  only not.  'cause that'd be weird.<BR>

<DD>okay, so i'm partially mostly dumb and i forgot the color codes.  authenticity checks?  stilettos, really REALLY big guns, and Joss = Supreme Yoda.  oh, and my nose ring's on the right side, not the left. <small>[or IS it....?  hmmm....]</small><BR>
<BR>
small comments tonight, back on tomorrow; i'm still recovering from shooting my short film last week.  long-ass hours, but so so so rewarding and worth it.  big with the happy and wiggly dancing.<BR>
<BR>
<b>POTENTIAL SPOILY-TYPE MATERIAL</b><BR>
<BR>
<small>1) the Hellbeast's name in the script was "Seekul", the only phonetic way i could think of spelling "<b>Ccool</b>" and have them pronounce it right.  big shout to the <b>Wifey</b>.<BR>
<BR>
2) "cows":  thought about using 'goats', but after the David Fury scene, felt i might be... oh, you know... sort of maybe kinda completely ripping off Tim Minear.  which ordinarily i'm good with -- do it all the time -- but then i realized it might be a particularly <i>obvious</i> rip-off, 'cause of the... well, <u>goats many</u>, know what i'm sayin'?  so i decided on "cows".  actually, to tell you the truth, i just threw that into the outline, thinking, "oh, they're never gonna let me get away with calling all our lead characters 'cows'."  but apparently those blackmail photos i have of... well, let's just call them "J.W." and "D.G." <small>[not *necessarily* their real initials]</small>... those photos have paid off.  in very legal and non-crime-perpetrating ways, of course.  <BR>
<BR>
um, hence, cows.<BR>
<BR>
3) Star Wars feeling not a mirage.  long story, Joss should tell.  or Tim.  or someone who won't bollocks it all up, and will make it funny, and entertaining, and also somehow politically pertinent, with possibly a moral at the end -- but not the kind that makes you feel bad about yourself, 'cause that really sucks when that happens, doesn't it?  it's like, they tell you this pretty story about a friendly little race between a couple of cute little animals when WHAM!  outta nowhere!  MORAL!  it's like, come on, man!  i've got a pretty healthy dose of insecurity already; like i need you telling me that because some rabbit got his cottony butt kicked by some scaly-yet-perserverant reptile-thing <i><b>i'm</b></i> supposed to be all, "ooh, now i'm gonna take my TIME and make sure i don't RUSH and watch where i LEAP and, you know, like, wear my HOUSE on my HEAD!"  like i need that kind of PRESSURE, man!  lay off!  jesus!<BR>
<BR>
so ask Joss.  or Tim.<BR>
<BR>
</small><b>PRETTY MUCH UNSPOILY SPOILIES, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU FIND OUT YOU KNOW IT.  AND THEN YOU'RE SCREWED.</b><BR>
<BR>
see y'all tomorrow,<BR>

Re: Angel being cancelled: <BR>
Apparantly we won't know if <BR>
Angel is cancelled from the <BR>
WB until 15th of May, which is <BR>
when WB releases it's new <BR>
Fall Line-up. Remember, if <BR>
they cancel, we then go to <BR>
UPN along with Buffy.

<DD>Thoin:  The project I'm working on is a comic book, but you won't be seeing it for a looooong time.  I'll keep you all posted.  As for Xander heroics, every dog has his day.  Well, most dogs, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Special thanks to Captain Joss for handing me another great story to work with.  <BR>
<BR>
Gotta run.  Guests are arriving for the west coast show.  <BR>
<BR>
Hugs and Pokes,<BR>
