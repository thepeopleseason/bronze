<DD>Thanks everyone!<BR>
<BR>
I was kidding about the "one hopes" part in my other post there.  Just to be clear.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again for the well wishes, I'll come back soon!<BR>

<DD>OK!<BR>

James Alexander Beck was born 6:47 PM on Friday October 13th.  He weighs 8 lbs, 8 oz, and is 20.5 inches long.  He, and his mom and dad (ie. me - one hopes!) are all doing great.<BR>
<BR>
We just got back from the hospital this afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
I can only stay for a bit... so this will have to be a near-drive-by.<BR>

<DD>okay, last post, must go "work"...<BR>
<BR>
<b>BuffyBuff</b>: hopefully, yes, there will be more -mere-penned eppies in the future.  they haven't stated <i>explicitly</i> that they're firing me yet, so i figure i still have a shot at another script...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Someone</b>: "Angel" is the only show i write for currently, though i do a little writing for myself on the side.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Buffster fan</b>: i'm a Staff Writer on "Angel", and my very first episode, called "Untouched" (and directed by my own personal Yoda, Joss Whedon), will debut tomorrow night. i'd say i'm "excited", but that would be an understatement.  more like, "i'm putting newspaper down all over my floor just in case i have an... accident."<BR>
<BR>
<b>Morella</b>: hmm... nekkid Angel? in my episode?  gee... i... i don't recall. maybe.  maybe not.  it's possible. <small>"Could you vague that  up for me?"</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Rosebud</b>: nice to meet you! i'll try to say hi to Amber for you -- if i can ever overcome my extreme mortification and speak to her face-to-face again, that is.<BR>
<BR>
<b>beautifulstars</b>: ooh, are you one of those Canadian folk who get the satellite feed?  lucky, lucky you! <small>just don't spoil it for us poor Yanks!</small><BR>
<BR>
okay.  lacking definitive wit and cleverness.  must go.<BR>
<BR>
<small>"Now, about the naked thing..."</small><BR>

<DD>hey y'all...<BR>
<BR>
just dropping in to say <small>YAY! i can't believe it's almost here! WOO WEE WOO WOO!</small> that i'm, you know, not <i>overly</i> disappointed that my episode airs tomorrow. i'm thinking about watching it -- <u>if</u> i'm not doing something more pressing, like, say, shaving my legs, or vacuuming, or re-caulking the tub.<BR>
<BR>
...and i really suck at the whole Hollywood nonchalance, don't i?<BR>
<BR>
<small>*doing miniature Snoopy dance*</small><BR>
<BR>
i'm so excited!<BR>
<BR>
anyway, i also wanted to tell you a little story about how truly geekbound i am.  this weekend i finally met Amber Benson -- had seen her around the lot and stuff, but had never actually talked to her -- and what's the first thing i say after she introduces herself?  <BR>
<BR>
"Oh, it's nice to finally meet you, <b><i>Tara</i></b>."  <BR>
<BR>
i kid you not.  few people possess my immeasurable capacity for outright SUCK, but i guess that's what makes me special, right?  i'm special, right?  i'm special?<BR>
<BR>
<small>"Angel, you don't find me *especially* paranoid, do you?"</small><BR>
