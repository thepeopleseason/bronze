<DD>Thank you, everyone, for the congratulations!  It's pretty cool to finally be getting some press.  =)  I'm sorry if I'm missing any questions or anything, but I'm being distracted and I have some band-related work to get done, so...<BR>
<BR>
Ishould probably go.  Don't wanna, but c'est la vie.  ;-)</SMALL>

<DD><b>SpookyMagoo:</b>  Nice to meet you, and thanks!<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  Thank you.  We knew we were on, of course; I just think it's cool that we were in a huge national paper.  (yay!)<BR>
<b>Vaedus:</b>  Hmmmmmm...pretty soon?<BR>
<b>Ski:</b>Just go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a> and download some songs.  We have a bunch of mp3's there for you.  (The one they're using is "Strong," from Never Kill A Boy on the First Date.  "Treason" is the other song used on that ep, but it will not be on the soundtrack.)</SMALL>

<DD>RSO's to <b>FASTEDDIE, Icelord, Vaedus, darkhorse, & cats!</b>  =)  Nice to see you all.  =)  Actually, if one of you has the actual paper, I would LOVE it if you could send it to me.  (Just the artical, not the <i>whole</i> paper...lol)

<DD>Hi, <b>Lexy!</b>  Band's doing great, just played at the Key Club in LA and at House of Sound in Kingman, AZ.<BR>
<BR>
This is the USA Today article.  (As forwarded to me today...)<BR>
<BR>
CROSS-CHANNEL ROCKS WITH 'BUFFY' AND THE BANDS<BR>
<BR>
What does 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' have in common with 'Touched By An<BR>
Angel,' 'Friends,' and 'Felicity'?  Virtually nothing--until October 19,<BR>
when WB's supernatural drama will join those series and others such as<BR>
'Dawson's Creek' and 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' in TV's trendiest<BR>
cross-media promotional club: shows with soundtrack albums.<BR>
<BR>
Music is an integral ingredient in 'Buffy's' humorous/horrific depiction of<BR>
teen life, from the series' propulsive instrumental theme by Nerf Herder<BR>
(which appears on the album) to recurring performances at the fictional<BR>
Bronze club by Dingoes Ate My Baby, the band in which taciturn<BR>
genius/werewolf Oz (Seth Green) plays (they're not on the album, but the<BR>
band that ghosts their songs, Four Star Mary, is).<BR>
<BR>
The soundtrack, on TVT Records, contains previously released and new songs<BR>
by well-known, little-known, and generally unknown acts, "handpicked," says<BR>
album producer Patricia Joseph, by 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon.  Whedon felt<BR>
the focus on newer acts was important in keeping "the tone of the album<BR>
similar to the tone of the show," Joseph says.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, songs by hitmakers Garbage, Alison Krauss and Sugar Ray are<BR>
outnumbered by tracks from indie-rock faves Guided by Voice and Bif Naked<BR>
(who'll appear in episode No. 3 in October), deep-underground band Velvet<BR>
Chain and brand-new act Kim Ferron.  First single from the album will be the<BR>
British hit 'I Quit,' from new female quartet Hepburn.
