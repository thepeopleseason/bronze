<DD>Okay, I really gotta go finish this animated Buffy outline, but a couple of things before I vanish for the evening.<BR>
<BR>
Willowhead:  Yes, we pay a lot of attention to the little things that appear in episodes.  Often times we are subtly setting stuff up for future episodes.  Remind me to talk more about this after "Spiral" airs on May 8.<BR>
<BR>
White Wings:  I'll read 'em!  Promise!<BR>
<BR>
Angel1753:  Aw, shucks.   Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  This is actually my first animated script for any show.  So far, it's a blast.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, really.  Gotta run.  Shameless plug #1:  Check out DeKnight's Riders for some pics.  More on the way.  Shameless plug #2: Check out the latest issue of the Buffy fan mag.  Interviews with Rebecca Kirshner and yours truly.<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight from DeKnight.  Be back tomorrow.

<DD>Thoin: Free time? No such thing.  I'm busily at work on the animated show as I type this. As for Boo, he's doing a great job.  Have you checked DeKnight's Riders recently?  He's got some pics up that I think you'll all find, uh, interesting.
