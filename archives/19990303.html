(As Jeff said, "We've gone without food before!"  lol)  Oh!  And the pic is going up on the Official Velvet Chain site.  Our photographer took it while you were on stage with me.  You can show your friends...hehe<BR>

<DD><b>NuPhalanx:</b>  No, actually.  I just came up with it on my own, but I did tell Mike-ff, who is sort of maintaining the site for the club, so they do know about it.<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  I haven't actually gotten around to sending you pic #2, yet...SORRY!!!!!  But I will, I promise.  Ack.  And then, you'll get the col<i></i>or one, too.<BR>
<b>mudpuppy:</b>  No, not yet.  We haven't even printed them up.  It'll be 2-3 weeks yet.  We'll let you know when we need your addy's.  =)<BR>
<b>the Slayer:</b>  I think you need to e-mail <b>Dirty Socks</b>.  Anyone have her e- addy handy???<BR>
<BR>
Everybody:If you want to order either "warm" or "The Buffy E.P.", do it through Apollo.  http://www.Apollointeractive.com  It works out much better for us.  Thanks!  (Of course, you can always order it through our site, too.  It makes no diffrence on <i>your</i> end.  We just get a better deal from Apollo.  Because they rock.  =)</SMALL>

<DD>RSO to <b>Ozman!!</b>  Did you hear I got a club???  =)<BR>
<b>Cleio:</b>  Cool!  Thank you.  Ever coming back into town for a gig?  ;-)<BR>
<b>Brat!</b>  Actually, that was part of the problem.  I am her "superior," but I'm not the main boss, and she felt I was acting with too much authority or something.  (I'm really putting it way too rationally.  She flipped out on me and started yelling "You may be my superior, but you ain't my boss!!!!")  anyway, she's the top seller in the store, so even though everyone in the company wants her gone, the owner wants to keep her.  I'm supposed to meet with her (the crazy coworker) tomorrow to "air out our differences."  gag.<BR>
<b>NuPhalanx:</b>  Well, I received it maybe a week ago.  That's the one, right?<BR>
<b>elover:</b>  We got busted at work for our AOL usage, so no more chats, I'm afraid.  =(

<DD>Hehehehe...OK, you Viva La Diva people:  It's just a little thing, really, but when I saw that Mike-ff would post, "What do you get for joining?  Well, nothing yet..." or something to that effect, I thought we should do something special for you guys.  SOOOOOO, we're printing up special photos of me from the PBP'99 (it a really neat pic, I think) and we're gonna send 'em to all you "Divatees."  Autographed.  Sound OK?  (It's in col<i></i>or, and everything!  Limited Edition.  Hehehehe)

You can also order them direct from us via Apollo:  http://www.Apollointeractive.com  (Can't link 'cause of the col<i></i>or thingy.)  It would actually be better for us, financially, if you ordered through their site.  (OK?)  Just click on the "Velvet Chain" text link on the opening page.<BR>
