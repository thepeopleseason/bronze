<dd>Hi. Didn't mean to disappear, but my wife popped in on me and I had to quickly pull up my Word for Windows program and pretend like I was working. Then, she stayed and talked! Back now, if only for a moment. Must to bed.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the misunderstanding about my future with Buffy. The future is, like, in the future, and therefor uncertain. Lots to weigh. Moving back to LA after three years in Seattle is not my idea of fun. We'll see. But, I do love working with Joss, so...<br>
<br>
GylzGirl - - Tony's dialog was actually pretty straightforward. Don't recall it offhand, and too lazy to go get the script clear across the room. Short, truncated, sentences with lots of ellipses. It wasn't the words that worked, it was the actor. I love Tony, if you can't tell. A writer's actor. And what a particular thrill, to be licked with my wife in the room and unsuspecting... I think I'll let that go.<br>
<br>
microserf - - Master of language. I find myself speechless. But, to put an end to the ugly rumor... I do NOT rock. Never have. Never will. And, I just got that Murray Head is Tony's brother... isn't he? Didn't put two and two together before. Tony just rose even more in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Oops, the sound of little footsteps approaching. Thanks to the miracle of Microsoft (thanks microserf), I can minimize the window and pretend again. But, I may not be back. Geez, this is just like growing up and my mom and Playboys. <br>
<br>
Gone...<br>
