<DD> Cory McCall: Desperate? Why would anyone be desperate to reach me? Most of the posters know my public e-mail address: Noz4atu@aol.com Will that do?<BR>
Haven: Sorry, I'm tired and i forget. When I say "house" I refer to a special make-up effects house: a better word would be vendor. We use Optic Nerve on Buffy and Angel will use David Miller.

<DD> Hueronin: Jeff's gone, but I'll oblige the blue. <BR>
Michelle: I have no idea about David's ethnic background - it never came up in conversation. <BR>
I must go to bed now. Thank you all for the stimulating conversation. I'll find time to return soon I hope.

<DD> Michelle & Kelly: Hello. Nice to meet you and welcome to the board. I am the make-up departmenmt head on Buffy and Jeff is the Stuny Co-Ordinator. David De Leon is a make-up artist on Angel. We are kindly thought of as VIPs as we work on the show and -speaking for us all- we love to interact with the fans on the board when we have the time. To distinguish us or to make for fast reference when scrolling we are allowed to post in col<i></i>ors.<BR>
Michelle: It generally takes about 1/2 hour to do a beauty make-up. I did Sarah in 11 minutes one day! The cast call time depends on the scenes we are filming that day. If Sarah is is a certain scene and we won't get to it until later her call may be 3pm or 7pm or 12am- it all depends on the work. Finally, David Boreanez is a very fun, charming and professional young man and I have thouroughly enjoyed working with him and will miss him very much from the Buffy cast.<BR>
Kristen: I have always been treated with the utmost respect and kindness and it has kept me coming back when I can -  however, I am happy to address criticizm and have often found that telling the stories about why things were done is very interesting for the fans and for me.<BR>
Haven: David's vamp make-up is a little different for the new show. The company hired another "house" to make the appliances so thingsa are a little different all around. So, yes, the make-up  takes Dayne about 1 1/2 hours to do.<BR>
Green Falcon: David De Leon has stepped away to watch the Golden Girls - it is 12:15 here in Hollywood - to answer your question, He did Aly   as a vamp on Halloween once and the pictures were published all over the place, but the vamp make-up onb the show was mine. <BR>
I think I can manage one more post before I fall down asleep.
