<DD>greengirl - if you meant the little guitar bit for the X/W smoochies, unfortunately, not only is it not one of my favorites, it's also terribly short (I think the longest it ever plays is fifteen seconds) and would make for a not-so-great CD track.  So I'd say its chances are not too good.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again to everyone for the owrds of support, and yes, I'll stop by from time to time to say hi.<BR>
<BR>
But for now I'm just saying bye!<BR>
<BR>
bye

<DD>RoB - I've got no definite projects lined up right now, although I have a few prospects.  I did just finish a film called "Bring It On", starring (coincidentally enough) Eliza Dushku - as a cheerleader! - that will be coming out in the early fall.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah's Carl - You canonly submit one episode to the Academy - it was indeed "Hush" for me this year.  I also submitted the Angel pilot as well.  I believe rob Kral submitted "Prodigal", but I'm not sure.

<DD>Ahh, it's just as well the codes don't work for me, since I no longer work on the show *sniff*...<BR>
<BR>
The truth (yes KAM) is once I got my little screen-time in "Restless" there was nothing left for me.  It's all about the cameo...<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to all the well-wishers, it means a lot.<BR>
<BR>
milk'n'cookies - Joss is listening to a pile of submissions right now.  I have no idea who it may be, but with the show's growing popularity, I'm sure the process will be much more competitive than three years ago when I first submitted my demo.

Good news, bad news, bad news:<BR>
<BR>
The good news is, Sony will definitely be putting out a score album.<BR>
<BR>
The bad news is, it won't be until Spring 2001.  They plan on releasing a second song album in time for Christmas 2000, and that one may have one or two score cues like the first one from TVT.<BR>
<BR>
The other bad news is, I've decided that it's time to pursue my dream of becoming a big famous superstar movie composer, and I'm leaving "Buffy".  It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made, but it's made, and I feel it's the right one, at least for me in the long term.<BR>
<BR>
Besides all that I got back from Africa two weeks ago and I'm in the midst of moving my studio across town, so things are chaotic everywhere.
