<dd>Okay, so that was a thing.   Thank you for hanging in with me, guys.  Now at last, I can tell you guys what happens next tuesday without lying.<br><br>1)I will probably have a beer.<br><br>2) earth, more or less turning, pretty certain.<br><br>3) I might read.<br><br>Cool!  Now I get why everyone loves spoilers!  I totally RUINED my beer-having for people who like surprises!  I see now that I was shackled by Buffy, and now I'm free.<br><br>Which, oddly enough, is not how I feel.<br><br>Hope you liked.<br><br><br><br><br>j<br><br>

<dd>Dust Em, thanks.  The new one, The Gathering Dark, comes out next month.<br><br>eirefairie--*sniff*  what makes you say that?<br><br>Irishrose--absolutely.  First round's on me.<br><br>Narrator, I wasn't aware of that.  Have you posted to ask the moderator about that?  If they can't do it that way, I will say we're certainly pushing to get a DVD made available, which would solve all such problems.  :)<br><br>

<dd>I think I need a drink.  Not, y'know, that I advocate alcohol as an answer to your problems.  :)<br><br>
