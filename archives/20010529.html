<DD>OK, I really have to go...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Mrs. Pointy:</b>  Tell <b>dog</b> hi back, and that she HAS to come to the show on June 16th, 'cause it may be the last show for a long time!<BR>
<b>Justice:</b>  Hello, and thank you!  We generally play in the LA area, although we sometimes get out to AZ or NM.  We're going to try and get over to the UK within the year.  We'll see what happens.<BR>
<BR>
I have to run...<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>

<DD>OK, I should get going pretty soon...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Zeus:</b>  LOL!  Well, that was entirely a spur-of-the-moment thing...  Ben kept going on about how "cute and thin" we both were, so when he said, "Which one of you is thinner?" I guess Nancy just decided to see how heavy I was!  LOL  And then I just picked her up right back, 'cause it seemed like the right thing to do.  hehehehe<BR>
<b>Dunlin:</b>  You are so fortunate!  I had to <i>work</i>  the enitre holiday weekend.  Retail job from hell, remember?  LOL  I called out sick today.  (Screw' em!  *eg*)

<DD><b>Nofetsur:</b>  Hiya!<BR>
<b>Mrs. Pointy:</b>  I have been well, but busy beyond belief.  Very happy to be getting out of town.  =)  Did you hear about my "Win Ben Stein's Money" thing?  It was a riot!  hehehe<BR>
<b>Sephiroth:</b>  Hi there...I'll try to post at both places, but I'm a poor typist, so we'll see if I can manage it!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  HI!!!!

<BR>
<b>zeus:</b>  Hey!  Thanks...it was a hell of a lot of fun.  ;-)  You thinking of coming to the big Key Club show on the 16th?  (It may be our last show for a while, so I'd try and make it if you can...)
