<DD><b>CharlieX:</b>  Hey!  
That's a great complimet, thanks!<BR>
<b>Cirrus:</b>  Sure...go ahead.<BR>
<b>Opus:</b>  Ack!  Well, here's 
the deal.  They closed that one 
down and are opening a different 
one.  (Some managers are moving 
on, etc.)  Please don't give up.  
Elizabeth is such a sweetheart.  
I'll find out what's going on, 
and I'll get back to you.  
(E-mail me, though, OK?)<BR>
<b>Jasmen:</b>  Not til May.  
(I'm sure you read that by now.  
Hehe)<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Will do.<BR>
<b>Asanti:</b>  Yes, e-mail me!  
I want to know what's going on.  
=)<BR>
<b>Anais:</b>  Cool.  You'll love 
it.  As for spreading the word, 
that's always helpful!<BR>
<b>FSMCDMan:</b>  Doing better, 
thanks!  How are you?<BR>
<b>BuffySummers81:</b>  
Hehehe...you're welcome.  The 
other bandmates are great, 
thanks.  I really hope we can 
finagle our way onto Angel.<BR>
<b>Beth:</b>  I'm still here, but 
I really have to get going.<BR>
<b>Jipsy Girl:</b>  Hi...<BR>

<DD>Wrapping up...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Beth:</b>  LOL!  Do you have 
our CDs, by the way?<BR>
<b>WatcherX:</b>  Very cool!  I'm 
glad you like us enough to give 
us as gifts!  =)<BR>
<b>Roxanne:</b>  Well, you just 
made my day.  Thanks!  And yes, 
we'd love copies!  And you're 
welcome for the pitching in.  No 
problem.  Send stuff to:<BR>
Velvet Chain<BR>
137 N. Larchmont Blvd. #535<BR>
Los Angeles, CA 90004<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Ooooo...cool!  
I'll check it out.  E-mail me 
when it's done.<BR>
<b>LittleWillow:</b>  Hehe..you 
know we ARE going to put up the 
pic of you and me that we have 
from the PBP at velvetchain.com.  
It's just taking our webmaster a 
long time.  He's swamped.  When 
all the new neat pics are up, 
though, I'll come by and let 
everyone know!<BR>
<b>Dingo Baby:,/b>  Thank you!  
And you MUST get the Buffy E.P.  
You'll like it even better than 
Warm, I bet!<BR>
<b>Bella Donna:</b>  We're both 
doing much, much better, thanks.  
But my jaw is still a tad off.  
=(<BR>
<b>Green Falcon:</b>  We'll 
probably play again in 
May...right now we're working on 
recordings.  Seattle is a 
possibility in the Fall.<BR>
<b>Grim Reaper:</b>  Great!  
thanks.  =)<BR>

<DD><b>Cirrus:</b>  LOL  Hi!<BR>
<b>Yooper:</b>  SO unspeakably 
LAME!!!!  I can't believe it 
dingoed my link!  ACK!!!<BR>
<b>kelime:</b>  Hehehe...I love 
to go, but I have a 2 week 
vacation already planned in July, 
so a trip to FL in August is not 
likely.<BR>
<b>Asanti:</b>  What a 
coincidence!  I am drinking that 
apple tea right now!  Hi, and 
yes, we're feeling better.  =)<BR>
<b>Jezebel:</b>  Yeah, the 
keyboard's tiny.  But the 
screen's nice.  Very high 
resolution.<BR>
<b>Roger Irrelevant:</b>  good 
advice.  I may have to do that!

<b>Quidam:</b>  Hehehe..yeah, I'm 
very pleased.  =)  And hi!<BR>

it was really great working with 
the cast, and I hope we get to do 
the show again (or Angel), too!
RSO's to <b>Lan, Pixie, and 
Gryphon!</b><BR>
<b>Beth:</b>  Actually, I've been 
signing all my life.  Like, since 
I could speak.  This is my very 
first band, though.  I always 
just sang in choirs, madrigal 
groups, did muscials, gave 
recitals, that sort of thing, and 
secretly wanted to ROCK.  
hehehe...well, now I do!  =)<BR>
<b>Dingo Baby:</b>  I wish!  not 
until we get a huge record 
contract, and need to support our 
album, I'm afraid.  But you can 
hear out stuff, and see pics of 
us live, at our site!  <a

<b>LittleWillow:</b>  Why don't 
you?  (Write)  I think it's silly 
that they did that.  But at least 
they did put up our web address.

like an IDIOT, to

think you're right.  Ah, well.  
You win some, you lose some.  =)<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  No!  I didn't 
scroll at all!  What did you say?  
(You Psychic Friend, you!)<BR>
<b>Droar:</b>  Maybe in the 
future.  We'd love to.<BR>
<b>Yooper:</b>  Good guess, I'd 
say.  Nope, as I said, too busy 
on the CD to tour.<BR>
<b>Beth:</b>  OK, I'll e-mail you 
- you weirdo!!!  lol  Um, it 
feels great to be in a 
band...especially as the singer.  
I love it.<BR>

put our CD back in 
there...QUICK!!!  j/k<BR>

it keeps cutting off the ends of 
my posts?  Are you guys seeing it

<DD>OK, so obviously I can no 
longer type in the little box.  
My new iMac doesn't seem to like 
that.  Grrr.  So I'm going to try 
typing in my e-mail program and 
cut-and-pasting, instead.<BR>
<b>theSlayee:</b>  Life in the 
world of music is quite good, but 
extremely hectic, thank you.  I 
don't think we'll be touring 
anytime in the near future.  
We're too wrapped up in our new 
CD.  (We hope to have it out

Yeah, it's a neat computer, but 
the keyboard's kinda small, which 
makes me even more typo-prone
