<b>Spence:</b>  Well, I appreciate the sentiment, but I mainly just asked Seth to tell all his friends he was gonna play, in hopes they'd show up to watch!  lol  No, really, thanks, but everyone involved did a lot to get them there.<BR>

<DD>Hi, <b>Destro & Shadowslayer!</b><BR>
<b>Buffy Sheridan:</b>  Hi!  Well, I pick out and purchase all my own clothes.  I will assume you asked 'cause you like them, and not 'cause I looked like an idiot. lol  Um, the Diva Icon logo was drawn by an illustrator named Chris Hertich off a photo of me during a performance.  Then, Jeff Stacy did a little manipulation in several different computer programs in order to make it more fluid.  Photoshop, Adobe, some other weird deal.  You get the picture.  Oh, and I'm fine...still have the stuffy nose, but the worst seems to be over.  =)<BR>
<b>Xander's Girl:</b>  Thanks!  (I wonder that, too!  lol)<BR>

<DD><b>Spence:</b> Well, thank you so much for the compliment; I actually enjoy the screaming; thanks for buying 2 CD's (all proceeds go to the we're-starving-artists-so-give-us-a break fund); and finally:  it was really no biggie, my pleasure, I didn't do much, and I wanted them there as much as anybody else.  =)<BR>
<b>fiver:</b>  Wow!  (again)  Thanks so much.  I'm so happy you enjoyed it, and thank you for helping to spread the word!!<BR>
<b>KrazyKat:</b>  Hi!  No prob on the SO...of course, only the francophiles heard it!  lol  The poster is in our rehearsal studio, where it can give me big happies.  =)  And Oh, yes, I love my comm badges.  (I got TWO!  So, nyah, nyah!)  lol  Aren't they just too fabu??

(That may seem like a no-brainer, but really, I like it enought to <i>listen</i> to it, which I don't normally do with my own stuff.)  And yes, Seth was really, actually playing guitar.  Just very simple guitar.  ;-)</SMALL>
