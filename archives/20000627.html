<DD>Well since Lioness is leaving I don't think I can find the strength to go on...<BR>
<BR>
... so I'll go and eat the fried chicken that Sophia just brought home.  It's the food of those evil southern bad guys and brit killers alike.  Makes us hard... or fat.  Depending on the grease level in it.<BR>
<BR>
Take care everyone.  And to all Brits out there, please try to avoid being evil and attempting to conquer the world for one day if you can help it.  Okay?  Imperial swine.<BR>
<BR>
Cheers then,<BR>
<BR>
Jeff Pruitt<BR>
who is being stared at by a British chick as we speak.  so I'd better get off this thing and eat now.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Corvus - Nope.  I don't usually have one of those.  Unless I've had too much girly pop that is.  <BR>
<BR>
clarrie - Tee Hee.  That's all I can say about that.  A dry stick would be even worse.  Guess you save that for someone you are really mad at.<BR>
<BR>
Hello Opus and Socks and GG and Vaal and anyone I missed.

<DD>Cobby - I soooo want to go to the UKPBP.  But I just got a call from one of the Hong Kong guys about going to Luxenborg to make a film.  (He needs the white face HK guy for .... bad guy stuff)  If I don't have to go then maybe I can stop by the UK and dance.  Did I mention that the Village People also have a song called "In the Navy?"  It has a dance too.  Or so they say.  I wouldn't know as everyone knows I'd be too dignified to do it.  (Unless I had too much girly pop in me)<BR>
<BR>
Lioness - Hey.  I tried to enter your site.  I had to give myself the name "the real Jeff Pruitt" because someone else took "Jeff Pruitt" already.  I'll try to stop by again sometime.  So look the "the real" in the name.  Guess I could have been more creative, but I was tired at the time.<BR>
<BR>
Dingo B - I'll check those out.  We had a great time there.

<DD>Arcanea - Sophia is going to play a (get ready for it PDR)  Evil Brit Terrorist!  Oh the typecasting.  How did they know she was evil?  Must have been that accent.<BR>
<BR>
Spacebabie - When you watch THE PATRIOT please take note of the ones in red coats.  They are the "baddies."  hehe

<DD>British Angel - Sophia is taking some stuff to try to speed it along.<BR>
<BR>
Boromir - I think it was Tony who handed me that drink anyway.  hmmmm<BR>
<BR>
Jakk - Yeah.  Did you see  the ankle break he got on RUMBLE?  That's what can happen.  Changes everything you thought you'd do.  He sure has taken a beating over the years.

<DD>Wow!  I just tried to type the name of an organization and it came up "tolerance."  Cool the way they do that, huh.<BR>
<BR>
What I said was ... K------K----K  <BR>
Wonder if that worked?  Hope you all are protected.  Cover your eyes please.  Just in case those three letters appeared this time. How funny.

<DD>PDR - Oh yes.  The evil Brit thang.  Let Motorcycle Au Pair Boy show you an old Hong Kong action flick sometime.  Brits are evil there too.  But hey, it gave Sophia a ton of work.<BR>
<BR>
I have to say the way we treat Asians in our films is pretty shoddy too.  Me and the Asian stuntguys usually say a prayer after we do a fight together on an American film that they won't use the ol' "gong" sound when they appear.  Yet they still do it.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Uh... I'd avoid Mel Gibson's new movie if I were you.  Evil Brits abound in it.<BR>
<BR>
At least bad guy brits can be cool in movies.  I'm from the southern USA.  I don't even want to talk about how they portray all of us.  Did I mention that I'm not in the tolerance?  Well I'm not.  Damn Hollywood crap ;)

<DD>Leather Jacket - Sure he does.  Always has.  Once you are the star, even a stuntman like Jackie has to be careful.  It's just too much work in his movies.  They are brutal.<BR>
<BR>
His name is Andy Kai Cheng.  If you watch PRIMEVEL closely you'll see the first vamp that Buffy punches when they run through is a blonde Chinese guy.  That's him.  Why was his hair blonde that day?  I have now idea.  I think it was for some other movie.  Maybe Charlie's Angel's or something.

<DD>Cobby - Not yet.  She leaves around July 3.  And yes, the mind is gone.  But you know that already;/<BR>
<BR>
Broomir - Girly Pop is the drink of champions.  They told me that all the guys in England drink it.  They weren't lying to me were they?  It's supposed to be loaded with goodness and stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Faife - the movie is call "US Seals 2"  At least it is right now.  They may come up with something better later.  It should be in Blockbuster and other video stores in less than a year.  (That's just how long it takes)  It may be in theaters overseas.  I'm sure the script will be your typical Navy Seals vs. the BAd Terrorist action thing.  But at least they will get a few cool fights in with the group that they have working on it.

<DD>Dr. Lectre - All Brits sound like Sophia to me.  Well... some do anyway.  Sophia is from London.  It kills her when I tell her how cute I think girls with Manchester accents are.  (*That's ususally when the head kick comes)<BR>
<BR>
Sure... I'd join the VIP conjuring club.  I just don't know if they'll take any orders from me.  But I can try ...<BR>
<BR>
"VIP appear!  By all that is Holy I say show up now!"<BR>
<BR>
Well... maybe I'm not doing that right.

<DD>SarahNicole - No.  Not yet.  I haven't checked the regular email today.  I will though.  You are right in that it is pretty hectic.<BR>
<BR>
I just wanted to let people know that they just hired one of my good friends yesterday to be the stunt coordinator for next season.  His name is John Medlin and he is a great guy.  We've been friends for years.  He knows what to do and I could't think of anyone else I'd rather see doing it.<BR>
<BR>
My other good friend, Mike Worth (he played the disco vamp when Faith was first intro'd on the show) is going to star opposite Sophia in her new movie.  And my other buddy, Andy (Jackie Chan's stunt double) is going to help Sophia with her fights on the flick.  <BR>
<BR>
Now if I could just heal that ligiment injury of hers overnight I'd be a happy camper.<BR>
<BR>
Didn't I just see some of these British folks the other day?
