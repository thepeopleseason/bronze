<dd>Hello all – can’t stay and talk.  We’re all busy at work here at the Mutant Enemy offices trying to serve your entertainment needs.  I’ll be in to chat in a few days just as soon as things die down. I just wanted to drop by and say thank you for all your kind words, you have no idea how much they mean to me.  This is one of the best days of my life and you guys are a big part of that.<br><br>P.S.  Joss wrote the song (it’s called “Mrs.”)  I can’t take any credit for it whatsoever.  We were on the set of Firefly when he was directing “The Train Job” and we were talking and he said something like, “What if we flash back to the musical…”<br><br>And then the very next morning he walked in and said, “I’ve got the song.”<br><br>Sometimes I think you can start car batteries with his brain. <br><br>Be back in a few days.  Minions, I love you all.<br><br>
