<dd>Numfargal:<br><br>SEE HERE IS AN EXAMPLE:<br><br>You introduced yourself by name <br>on the night. Then here on the <br>internet I see "NumfarGal" but <br>wouldn't have known who this is <br>until I clicked the "picture of us"!<br><br>Name tags with name and call <br>sign: problem solved<br><br>(PS to the PBPc: I still ahad a <br>blast. Its only coming on here <br>today and thinking about it I <br>realise how cool this would be).<br><br>

<dd>Blade and KAM:<br><br>Re: Name tags at PBP.<br>I'd actually love to see name <br>tags at the PBP for everyone <br>including all the BRONZERS!! <br>From my point of view, there <br>were several people there at the <br>Bronze that I didn't know were <br>there (Bronzers that is) and if <br>we'd ALL had nametags this <br>would benefit not only fans <br>interested in meeting behind the <br>scenes people, but VIPS <br>wanting to meet Bronzers.<br><br>Of course, lots of people hate <br>name tags. Perhaps it could be <br>produced on the spot (wouldn't <br>take much to have and extra <br>computer or three printing these <br>out) at the door. If you don't like <br>the idea you just wouldn't wear <br>it. But I think even amongst the <br>Bronzers who don't know each <br>other it'd be coool to walk <br>around and see fellow <br>nick-names etc on tags: surely <br>we'd all get a lot more out of it.<br><br>As it is I think the PBP is great <br>and I had a blast. But I do think <br>the name tags would be cool for <br>everyone.<br><br>
