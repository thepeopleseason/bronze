<DD>jamie marsters - Hi.  Sorry.  I was just passing by and thought I'd do a quick lurk.  And what did I spy with my little eye?  Somone pretending to be me.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry about that.  I don't know what to do there.  Maybe you can look at the numbers or something to see if it's really me.  If no colors  then at least they could protect the fans from the wackiness of imposters by protecting my name again.  That's not too much to ask for.  We have too much of that going around at the moment.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway... Jamie, you can click on my email addy there and I'll talk to you about that stuff later if you want- away from the Bronze.<BR>
<BR>
again, sorry about that kind of thing.

<DD>Eiddleg - Sometimes it is Chuck's stunt double, his student Chip Wright.  Other times he uses those Chuck Norris jeans with the special gusset in the crotch.  Have you seen those things?  Faith would kill you on general principle and steal your cowboy hat if you wore that around her.<BR>
<BR>
clarrie - Girlie Pop is good for anything that ails you.  I hear it's loaded with vitamin C and goodness.  And you can never have too much goodness in you.  Unless you are a vampire or something.  Then it only cramps your style.<BR>
<BR>
chiquens - I made them fly when they were outside in the town.  I used two 50 ton cranes to stretch  two long heavy duty cables between.  I built a rig in my garage over the weekend to suspend the two stuntmen from and used a winch to pull them along.  Another stuntman kept his hands on an up and down control rope rigged with counter weights to keep them at the proper level during the uneven travel.  They actually flew over 400 feet and stayed 6 to 12 inches off the ground the whole time.  It was pretty weird looking.

<DD>Jakk Frost - No I didn't see it.  I just got a few emails from people and so I stopped by today.  If you said anything about me being omnipotent or God-like, then thanks.  If you attacked me then I can only say to you sir, Meet me after school at 3:15 pm and prepare to meet thy maker.  Just promise me you'll keep your eyes closed as I am very shy in RL.<BR>

<DD>Hi Menerva<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
TMorel - Girly Pop is the official drink of the 2k Nocturnal!  Only a real man can drink it with pride.  ;)<BR>
<BR>
Dru - Doing the YMCA whilst surrounded by people dressed as vampires and Rocky Horror characters seemed the only proper thing to do at the time.  I do have my dignity still.  You can thank the Gods that Be  that I didn't do the "Robot" for you.<BR>
<BR>
SarahNicole - I would attempt to fill out anything you like as long as it doesn't require thought, tact, or brevity.  Is it one of those Y or N  things?  I can handle that.

<DD>Betty - No.  Sophia doubled someone else.  I'm not sure.  Was Julie Benz in that movie?  Sophia doubles her too sometimes.<BR>
<BR>
MedusA - Flossie has everyones name on her.  So she must be a VIP in some sort of weird inflatable animal way.  She is internationally known you know.<BR>
<BR>
Eiddileg - Karen was in Texas stunt doubling for Nia Peeples on WALKER: TEXAS RANGER, so Sophia had to step in.  That's her regular job.  Faith only comes up once in a while.  At least she has so far.

<DD>Vanessa - I did get to play the game a bit in its early stages.  Looks pretty cool so far.  I know it won't be out for a long while yet.  Lots of work to do on it still.<BR>
<BR>
Minerva - Thanks.  Now --- SPOILER ALERT ---<BR>
<BR>
*Blade stunt double Clay Fontenot informs me that in BLADE 2 there will be .... sword action.  Yes!  I guess it would be strange for him to carry that sword around all night and never use it at all, eh?  All I know is this... never, ever under any circumstances should anyone attempt to pick up and play with Blades sword.  It's just bad for u.<BR>
<BR>
St. Germain - They put tiny motion capture balls all over Sophia, myself, and some of my stunt guys from the show.  We played every character and did a bunch of wire gags for them.  After capturing our moves they then give our movement to the various c.g.i. figures in the game.  That's what gives them the realistic motion.  It's from real people.<BR>
<BR>
greeneyes - Yeah.  Man a night I spent here chatting away.<BR>
<BR>
Cobby - No problem.  Photo shoot went well (for Bizarre magazine - just in case you see it).  I even allowed Sophia to smack me in the face for a few pics.  They wondered why I kept singing YMCA all the time though.

<DD>Lioness - Okay.  you've got it.<BR>
<BR>
Annie - Only a portion of it (and she doubled Faith some too)  A lot of the credit has to rightfully go to a man named Mike Vendrell (who is also a big HK movie buff) He and Mike Massa worked hard on it.  And Spiro (who is the stunt coordinator) and Lane Leavitt and his team (who did all the wire stunts).  My only baby contribution was teaching Mike Massa one of the wire stunts.  All of the fights were great in that one.  I really have to give Spiro a lot of credit for those camera angles too.  He knows his stuff and he has to work under tough conditions to make that happen.  (*Did I mention how much people want to go home late at night when it's finally time to shoot a fight?)  Yep.  He pulled it off very well.  I loved it.<BR>
<BR>
And yes, Eliza does actually rock.  I've seen her do it.  <BR>
<BR>
Georgie - I believe that the sun came out over London due to my incredible and lovely God of Stunts countenance.  Clouds dared not appear.  Well... until they did.  Didn't they read my script?  Damn those prima donna clouds!<BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Pointy - Yep.  I think all of us from the show looked half dead (due to Jet Lag) but Cobby looked all fresh.  Next year I say that the UK NOCTURNAL should be held in Los Angeles.  Close to my house, y'know?

<DD>Cosmic Bob - Hey.  I bought that FEMME FATALES magazine this month myself.  You don't have to tell me.  I got eyes. hehe<BR>
<BR>
Trip was great.  Only had time to take the open air bus around London.  No time to get out and about.  <BR>
<BR>
Jasmen -  Sophia is about to leave soon to start a movie in Bulgaria.  She's co-starring as a female terrorist and they are trying to add abunch of fights to the script as we speak.  Only problem is that she tore her ligiment while we were making the Playstation 2 Game before we left and that is going to hinder her action.  (*ahem that was Sophia Crawford who tore her ligiment.  Just in case you hear a different version on a talk show later* ;)  Still, I know she'll do her best.  I'm just happy to have her put her own face out there again.

<DD>Mrs. Pointy and Tara - We had a blast.  Those fans treated us really well.  I was even amazed by the knowledge of Hong Kong films that some had.  They seemed to just appreciate the work we did and could care less about any thing outside of that.  <BR>
<BR>
I loved the multiple Giles act.  Tony and I thought that one actually looked just like his stunt double, Doogie.  The baby Spike that ran up and started doing kicks toward James was very cute too.

<DD>Hello folks of the Bronze.<BR>
Sophia and I just got back from London and we had a great time.  The fans there simply appreciated the behind the scenes tape that showed us making the fights and no one asked me anything about Sarah.  It was a lot of fun.  I had a good time seeing James again (as well as everyone else) and lots of fun was had by all.<BR>
<BR>
I just wanted to say that I've been told that someone posted an interview that Sophia and I did on here.  I do understand that he is a young person and maybe he didn't mean to cause a scene. All I can do is ask him and everyone else to do one favor for me:<BR>
<BR>
Joss and I sat down and talked and we both said that we wanted to leave the Bronze as a place for the fans to talk about the show itself.  I'll always be honest and if that bothers anyone else I'm sorry.  But I can only ask that you read what I say or talk directly to me away from the Bronze about anything like that and we can talk about more light hearted stuff here.  That way we don't upset anyone else.  You want to read the parable or an interview or just ask me anything yourself, then I'm always open to anyone here.  I just don't want to see people attacking each other (or me) over nothing.  You guys don't have to do that.  I still respect Joss and love the show.  I won't be intimidated by any threats (obviously) but I will continue to try to support the show and the excellent work that goes into it.  <BR>
<BR>
Please remember that the show is made by over a hundred people and most of them are really nice and hard working folks.  Just like me and Sophia. But even if everyone were rotten, it wouldn't make a difference.  It's still one of the best shows on TV.  Bar none.<BR>
<BR>
So anyway... how's the weather?
