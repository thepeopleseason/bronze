<dd>Gotta run...  Thanks so much to everybody - US, UK, and other citizens alike - for sending me those good luck vibes, even if you didn't know what the show was!  hehehe<br><br><br><b>bhd:</b>  I haven't even gotten them developed yet!  But the program has been scanned and is up here, if you'd like to see it:  <a href="http://www.lama.com/velvetchain/eka_ocweeklyawardsprogram.html" target="_blank">OC Weekly Program</a><br><b>Ouroborous:</b>  Yes, it was great finally meeting you, too!  So glad you like the new CD! And yes, I plan on posting still for CD Thursday, but I won't be able to this Thursday, as I'm doing extra work during the day and rehearsing for my play that night...  But I'll come by soon, I promise!<br><b>happy:</b>  You're very welcome, and again, Happy Birthday!  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Major Wiggins:</b>  hehehe...  I wish I could!  But they have these stupid dress-code rules, so I'm going to look a lot more conservative than usual, I fear.  Oh, well.  I'll still try to look semi-cute, I promise!<br><b>gazoo:</b>  Hey!  Long time, no post!  Thanks for the vibes!  (I'll be at the lot from about 9am til 6pm PST tomorrow, so send 'em on out anytime during the day!)<br><b>kathypg</b>  Thanks!  Nope, no idea yet.  Although if I had to guess, I'd say this summer.<br><br>

<dd><b>Dunlin:</b>  Well, flaked out may have been too harsh.  One of them flaked, just totally forgot about the taping, even though he requested the ticket to come.  The other just isn't feeling well (she has a cold), and she wants to stay home tomorrow.  Thank you so much for the support!  =)<br><b>bhd</b>  LOL...well, I don't know about that.  I've done just about <i>nothing</i> to prepare, 'cause I've been so busy with rehearsals and stuff, and I just <i>know</i> my competition is sitting at home, reading the Encyclopaedia Brittanica or something!  ;-)<br><b>kenickie:</b>  hehehe...  Here's hoping I win anything at all!  ;-)<br><br>

<dd>Cassie, Mar and Halfrek<br><br>Good to see SOMEONE here <br>watches Miracles. Okay Okay <br>this is the Bronze. But I really <br>think most people here really <br>should be watching it. Super <br>high quality stuff, and hey, it's <br>Greenwalt! <br><br>The episode: "Hand Of God" (I <br>believe will be next week) <br>continues and deepens the <br>main story arc from the pilot...<br><br>
