Oh... my fave show people aren't watching, that's not Buffy or Angel?  Freaks and Geeks.  I love it sooo much.<BR>
<BR>
Okay... hate to rush off, but all this computer ickiness.... I feel like I'm getting hassled by the man.

Okay... I don't know about you guys, but I'm finding this glitchiness difficult, so I'm not gonna hang out too long.<BR>
<BR>
And David Mello... they shaved an actor for me.  But they didn't shave his head .

I love toast.  I like to make tuna fish sandwiches on toast. <BR>
<BR>
I also like Faith and feel she could be redeemed if circumstances were right.<BR>
<BR>
Which do I like better, toast or Faith? ... well toast has the advantage of being non-fictional...  Hmm...

<DD>JSK -- more plans for Faith -- well I don't know what I'm allowed to say, but if I were you I wouldn't be missing any eps of a fine program called "Angel."  Because of Faith?  Possibly, or perhaps simply because of its high production values and general watchability.

<DD>Okay, I'm risking the name code thing because that "imposter" label is just embarrassing.
