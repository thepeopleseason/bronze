<DD>I gotta run.  Hope I didn't miss anyone.  Which goat killer was David Fury?  The one with the really high voice.  KIDDING!  The blond.

<DD>I wrote an "X-Files" spec.  But that was after much syndicated TV stuff and some spec features.  <BR>
<BR>
Do we have an arc planned out?  Oh, yes.  We sure do.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Could be SPOILERS...<BR>
<BR>
What happened to D&D?  They didn't disappear, they left.  Angel "knew" Darla in "Reprise," let her live in "Epiphany," and told her to clear out or he would kill her.  She took his advice.<BR>
<BR>
thanks Impaler General -- what do I win?

<DD>A theme for Angel S3?  Uh... "It's never too late to start living -- even if you happen to be dead."  <BR>
<BR>
Thoin -- you really want your spec to be something that's currently on the air -- not an episode of "A Team" or something.

<DD>Slayed, there's writing for television and writing for a show under people you respect and like.  It's great.  When I see Jane, I shall do that.

<DD>Joss would never take cuts, I don't believe it!  Terri, Jane and I had a blast last year at Dragoncon, as you know.  But this year they didn't invite us.  So... hey, we can take a hint.

<DD>  All right, apparently staying for just one more minute to say . . .<BR>
<BR>
'NESS!!!!  *hugs*  How are ya?  You always sneak in as I'm on my way out.  Hey, the Angel comics can't be TOO sad.  THey won't let me kill anyone.<BR>
<BR>
Slayerqueen, thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Skyler, yep!  Look for The Lost Slayer, a four part serialized Buffy novel, starting in August.<BR>
<BR>
Now I'm really gone.  And (for those of you who remember) not in a Ty way.

<DD> Going now.  One piece of news before I do, though.  For those of you who haven't heard yet, Tom Sniegoski and I are writing the script for the Buffy video game coming out on Microsoft Xbox.  More fun than human beings should be allowed.<BR>
<BR>
Evalie--no, but how weird is that?  It's her real name, and my real name, and both our fathers were named James.

<DD>  Gotta go in a second.<BR>
<BR>
SlayaFaith--I didn't work on the second one, so I have no idea if there'll be a third.  Someday, I suspect.<BR>
<BR>
Algerina, thanks.  I'd kind of like to do a novel version of Blood of Carthage myself.  I'm very fond of that story.<BR>
<BR>
Buggo--sign me up!!!<BR>
<BR>
Shan--Um, it's all in the book.  *snicker*  Seriously, though, there are a couple of small Shining connections.  The Stand, though, is VERY connected by virtue of Randall Flagg's importance in the overall universe and the fact that in Dark Tower 4 they actually go INTO the world of the Stand.

<DD>  Christopher Marlowe--thanks.  :)  "I" had fun with them.<BR>
<BR>
Buggo--hey.  Things are going all right.  Though "in the Buffy world" I don't know.  I don't live there, I only visit.<BR>
<BR>
SlayaFaith--hi there.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Brad, Narrator--thanks guys.  Yeah, the color thing is cool.  At least I don't have to answer "how come you don't have colors?" anymore.

<DD> Shan, the SKU is available at most bookstores in the US and online.  I like your point about Shining being non-fiction.  :)  The Shining is presumed to be part of the SKU but there aren't a lot of major connections.<BR>
<BR>
Nephy--I didn't write it, so no clue.  Sorry.  As for the books thing, not asking anyone to actually MOVE books, just to turn them ninety degrees.  And yay Prowlers at the book club.<BR>
<BR>
Cashmere--um, yes?<BR>
<BR>
JaClaS--I'd just be guessing if I answered that one.  Could be she was like that before she became a demon, and that's why she had so much trouble with guys.  Heh heh.

<DD>  Greeneyes!  Hey there.  :)  Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Beldin--There aren't too many comics that REALLY impress me these days, so i see your point.  I think we've done some fun stuff in the Buffyverse though.  Glad you liked the Cordelia story.  I thought Eric did a great job with the humor.<BR>
<BR>
Slayerqueen, hey there!

<DD>  Howdy folks.  :)  Working late again, thought I'd pop in and say hello.<BR>
<BR>
Wolfguard, Beldin, hope all's well with you guys.
