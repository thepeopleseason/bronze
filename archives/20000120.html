<DD> Gazoo, why do you assume the Council did a two century cover-up of Angelus' career?  It seems to me perfectly likely that other entities, not unlike the council, or former scribes like today's Whitley Striber, wrote their own histories of people such as our own Angelus.  He exists in this universe and one might assume that some of the books Giles has on hand might be available elsewhere, yes?  Now, stop making me procrastinate, I have to turn in two acts tomorrow.<BR>

(and nothing to spill that would justify my kneecapping, Hitomi)<BR>

<DD> Just a quick clarification -- Kate was not doing her research at the Los Angeles Public Library.  First she was searching police archives bas<i></i>ed on Angel's claims, there having found supporting evidence in a traditional, "just the facts" kind of way, she moved on to "The Psychic Eye" bookstore.  She took her natural facts and married them to the supernatural.  Does Los Angeles have busy bookstores stocked full of every topic one would hear on the Art Bell program?  You bet your tin type.
