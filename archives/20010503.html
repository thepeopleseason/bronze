<DD>Joss -- I'm your biggest fan.  Is it true that BUFFY is moving to The Learning Channel?<BR>
<BR>
And which day would be good for me to come clean out my desk?

<DD>Gotta bail.  Lobe to you, Kiba, and sorry I couldn't answer more questions.  We're still working out the detail of the site move, if there is one.  As for how the WB will treat Angel, I assume they'll treat it well.  We'll make it good -- that's all we can do.  And leave the rest to fate.<BR>

<DD>MacBeth!<BR>
Macbeth!<BR>
MacBeth!<BR>
<BR>
Oh, I'm sorry, was that a bad thing to say?<BR>
<BR>
As for spoilers, there will be some death, there will be someone leaving the show, there will be some misery, and a happy ending, all wrapped in a neat little bundle of maudlin postmodernism!  Don't miss it!<BR>
<BR>
As for the scottish MACBETH play, we did it at the house a few months back and there was no curse a'tall.  So there.

<DD>Kiba!  Yes, I just linked up and saw the site.  Can't stress this enough:  Your "Joss is a hottie" arguement would be much more convincing without those pesky PHOTOS.  (You know, they say the camera adds ten chins).  You should put up a site with photos of your own self -- much hottier.  But it's still nice, and so's the me and kai site.  Thanks!
