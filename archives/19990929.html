Well, I'm going to go now, but here are a few last thoughts...<BR>
<BR>
Please don't worry about this season.  It's going to be amazing... I think we're doing episodes as strong as any we've ever done, and the season premiere is going to blow your undergarments off.  New elements are added without any of the magic being lost.  Joss is amazing and he's going to give us all a great year!<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

Hmm.  I guess I can tell you the title for Ep 8 -- you all seem to find out anyway, and I'm extremely careful to give titles that don't let too much out.  It's called "Pangs."  (that's right, Pangs, not Fangs.)<BR>
<BR>
And so many people in my fan club?  My God.  That's weird.  Imagine if I was famous or accomplished?!

I will neither confirm nor deny any rumors about Seth.  And don't think that means he's leaving, because I'm so sneaky that I'd do this whether he's going, staying or going and coming back.  But I will say that Oz has, at this point in the season, been given quite a lot to do already.  We love his character!<BR>
<BR>
And for the person who said they quibbled with Earshot... don't sweat it, there's stuff I'd change too.

Wow.  So much friendliness!  Hi to all of you!<BR>
<BR>
I'm writing 8 of Buffy.  8 of Angel is currently shooting, probably as we speak!

Hi Labyrinth, and thanks!  People seem to be groovin' on the Earshot, which makes me very pleased and proud!<BR>
<BR>
I usually type pretty well, actually, but I've been writing hot scooby-gang action for you all day long -- big fun coming up!
