<dd>I had an amazing time.  I got to speak for an hour on a stage with Jane Espenson and then again with Bailey Chase, whom I was meeting for the first time (I think we did pretty well considering we knew each other for thirty-seven minutes before we went up there) and I got to see all my old Buffy friends and meet SOOOO many cool fans, and then I had Cadbury Creme Eggs and strawberry-white chocolate McFlurries, so, you know... it's like a perfect weekend.<br><br>No, seriously, really leaving now.  I have a Smallville episode to write...!<br><br>Huggies.<br><br>
