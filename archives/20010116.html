<DD><u>SPOILERS BELOW, I'M SURE. AVERT Y'ALL'S EYES.</u><BR>
<BR>
<b>SpikesDru</b>: did you just ask me for one of my <i>socks</i>? 'cause i'm not sure what that means, but i'm pretty sure you're somewhat insane.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Sarah's carl</b>: didn't Doug Petrie already say something like, "Glory <i>wishes</i> she were as scary as -mere-"? or something like that. and, okay, that's all well and good, but -mere- <i>wishes</i> she had Glory's dress size, so...<BR>
<BR>
<b>CYMru</b>: <small>you're not a suck up. you're not a suck up. but i like you anyway.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Bronze Archivist</b>: the only thing i was really "going for" with the lack of Angel dialogue combined with the voiceovers was to illustrate exactly how removed Angel has become -- how Angel, the character, is being... (you can see it coming, can'tcha?)... <i>redefined</i>. i see this same phrase popping up on the board: "Neither Angel nor Angelus", and that phrase is making me monstrously gleeful, 'cause that was the whole point. and let me assure our loyal fans: you ain't seen nothin' yet. hoo boy.  poor y'all.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kiba Rika</b>: i would never impinge on the Joss-as-hottie market. hell, make me a "Joss is a Hottie" baseball cap and i'll wear it. <small>upside down and backwards, maybe, but that'd just make it a "Joss is a <i>Satanic</i> Hottie" cap.</small> and there are worse things to reek of than Joss. some of them write for "The X-Files".<BR>
<BR>
<b>slayerdaddy</b>: well, the writer's strike is slated to begin when our contract expires May 1. as it's scheduled now, we'd be done shooting both "Buffy" and "Angel" by then, but that's not the sticky wicket. said wicket involves coming back for seasons 6 and 3, respectively, 'cause rumors have been bandied about concerning the length of the strike, and those rumors intimate that the strike could last upwards of 6 months. for those playing the home game, that'd mean WICKED delayed seasons -- try December, January, or February for a premiere -- and that's if we even got to have a full season at all. ugliness abounds.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Irene Adler</b>: just for you, i will make <i>certain</i> that Angel wears socks in my next episode. i hope this makes you happy.<BR>
<BR>
<b>KarenT</b>: yeah, i kinda miss the Clubbers, too -- except for now i'm not working in some corporate hellhole and i get to write for one of my favorite television shows and they pay me for it and i even have my own parking space. but other than that, yeah. i miss the Clubbers.  and no, i didn't pick "Champions" -- i think that may have been a Greenwaltian touch.<BR>
<BR>
thanks, <b>VonnieL</b>.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Jackie</b>: i can't (obviously) comment on upcoming eps, and whether or not there's crossover potential -- mostly 'cause the only person in the world i'm afeared of is Joss, and he's kinda my boss, so... but i will tell you that the next two Angel episodes both have the letter "e" in the title. how's that for forthcoming?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Lochdhu</b>: actually, i didn't have "Bladerunner" in mind when i wrote "Redefinition", although i <i>did</i> go back and rewatch "The Crow", for two reasons: 1) had the little girl's voiceovers, and 2) had that bleak feeling of darkness i was looking for.<BR>
<BR>
<b>horizon</b>: it wasn't so much a continuity error as a bonehead error. nobody's fault but my own, 'cause i wrote it that way.  but i wanna see if anyone else notices it, or if i really need to be in therapy for my neurosis. <small>(all right, all right. so that one's a given.)</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Meeby</b>: is your roommate single, by any chance?  seriously, that's the nicest compliment i've ever gotten.  tell your roommate "thank you" especially from me.<BR>
<BR>
<u>SPOILERS ABOVE, I'M SURE. WATCH YER HEADS.</u><BR>

okay, y'all. gotta book. prolly this'll be dingoed. czech back in tomorrow. kiss kiss. stiletto stiletto.<BR>

<DD>jeezey creezey.  how the hellmouth did Ty do this?<BR>
<BR>
okay. got answers to a BUNCH of questions. only problem being i gotta bail pretty rapidly because... well, i'd kinda like to see my own ep, which starts in a little less than an hour. so, for all those who don't get answered, please bear with; i'm not ignoring anyone. <BR>
<BR>
except for <b>belmont</b>. and that's intentional.<BR>
<BR>
<small>back as soon as i finish the questions... then i be dashalicious...</small>

<DD>sorry about this post, but it's all spattered wit <b>belmont</b>'s blood. <u>no</u><u>one</u> calls me a "fluffy bunny" and  gets away with it.<BR>
<BR>
mind the mess.<BR>
<BR>
<u>SPOILER STUFF BELOW</u><BR>
<BR>
re: the voice-over. some people go  for it, others don't. but the fact is, Angel doesn't speak a single  word of dialogue for the entire ep (didja catch that?), so that may be why some peeps are missing the Angel-y goodness of it. point? 'twas intentional. this is an Angel you've never seen before: neither Angel, nor Angelus. in my head, i sometimes thought of him as "Angel<sub>3</sub>". just my dorky MO. <BR>
<BR>
and it's  getting way too sticky in this  post. back after i clean up the entrails.

<b>Circe</b>: thanks, sweets -- and yeah, "ass pansy" was one of those things where you write it, and then you laugh at your own writing, and then you think to yourself, "holy God. i need to have a few Valiums and lie down."<BR>
<BR>
<b>Pixie</b>: believe me, you weren't the only one with Dru-in-pink-turtleneck issues. though i thought she looked great in Lindsey's office, didn't you?<BR>

<DD><b>invincor</b>: unfortunately, i <i>did</i> make a reference to "Agent Smith" in the script. it was, uh... taken to a whole new level in the shoot. uh... yeah.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kryana</b>: your question will be answered. maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, but you <i>will</i> be answered. oh yes. you <i>will</i> be answered.

<DD>well, i was all prepared to come in here and lap up the praise like so much Stoli, but thankfully <b>silverwolf</b> smacked me back down to earth.  now, no matter how bigheaded and arrogant i find myself getting, i can always remember that some people find me atrocious. <small> kind of reminds me of my love life... you know... were i to have one. </small> seriously, though -- i actually have to thank <b>silverwolf</b> for the reality check; down-to-earthiness is GOOD.  so while i, myself, am <i>very</i> happy with "Redefinition", it helps to know that there are some folks out there unwilling to pull the punches.  thanks, <b>silverwolf</b>.<BR>

<DD>hey y'all!<BR>
<BR>
just wanted to drop by for a little pre-show "howdy", and to titillate you with non-spoily spoilers, wherein:<BR>
<BR>
<b>Non-Spoily Spoiler of the First Part</b>: keep an ear out for the <u>amazing</u>, bloody <u>amazing</u> score from Robert Kral.  i was stoked for the eppy <i>before</i> i heard the music laid in, and oh-my-heavenly-stringbeans does he WORK IT. like a hopped-up clubber on ten tabs of E, does he work it.  <small>(relevance of simile to actual substantive comment: zero.)</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Non-Spoily Spoiler of the Second Part</b>: nestled amongst the... uh... waterlogged dialogue, is a teeny itty bitty shoutout to <b>Muffy</b>.  and it's not really "amongst", per se; in fact it's less "amongst" than it is "post-amongst", but it's in act two, and that's really all i have to say about that. <small>(thank God, 'cause i don't think i could have gotten MORE incoherent.)</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Non-Spoily Spoiler of the Third Part</b>: watching the eppy last night, i caught an insanely stupid logistical error that apparently never occurred to me whilst actually <i>writing</i> the damn thing. it's nothing big, but i know y'all will catch it, and i'd just like to acknowledge my moronity before anyone else does. like i said, it's not a big deal, and you might not even catch it the first time, but bottom line: i = dope. <small>(and not in the cool, mid-80's pre-gangsta rap way.  more in the stuttering, drooling, lobotomized mongoloid way.)</small><BR>
<BR>
...and in other news...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Circe</b> and <b>NancyE</b>: i owe you huge thanks and hugs and kisses and other possibly less socially-acceptable forms of acknowledgement and gratitude. working on proper atonement for my craphood re: email, thank-you notes, and general human beingness. gifts are in the worx. i suck big.<BR>
<BR>
hasta pasta, babies. this chick's got mucho de crappo to do...<BR>
<BR>
<small>"Ooh.  Flogging."</small><BR>
