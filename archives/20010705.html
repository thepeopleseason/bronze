<DD>  Hookay... I've gotta go write something that'll entertain America, so I'll just try answer a few of Xanderella's questions before I go:<BR>
<BR>
I've been here about two months now, and it's certainly a dream-job.  I was a huge Buffy/Angel fan since Buffy started, so I'm having a real "over-the-rainbow" experience here.  All the other writers are smart, funny and just plain cool.  (Except for the 
backstabbings and fist-fights, but those were just misunderstandings.)<BR>
<BR>
I've written a few things before this (see www.scoobygang.com for the mundane details.) But this is by far the most fun I've had on a writing staff.  And, yes, Joss is rather God-like in the writing department (like you didn't kn
ow that) so that doesn't exactly suck either.<BR>
<BR>
I'm currently working on a story that's slated for episode 5 for this upcoming season of Angel.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for all of your well-wishes and welcomes and I'm sorry I couldn't answer every question.  I'll try to stop back by soon and chat more extensively next time.  Bye for now!

<DD>  Just a tip: If someone's using my name on here and is giving Buffy spoilers, it ain't the real me.  If they're misspelling the word "here" as "hear" then it's probably me. <

<DD>  Wow, a few minutes in here and I've already screwed up and acquired an impersonater.  Accept no substitutes!!<BR>
<BR>
Kristen: Yes I have.  Happy to be hear and thanks for the mention on scoobygang.com<BR>
<BR>
Zeus: Fred,having spend 5 years in a demon dimension is obviously going to have some adJusting to do.  I could say more, but I don't want to lose this cool job I just got.<BR>
<BR>
Janni:  Lindsey is still out there in the Angel-verse, so it's always possible that he'll come back for a visit.  If I said more, Tim and Joss would drag me from my office and have me beaten.  And not in the fun way. </fon

<DD>  "Animated Buffy??"  What?  No Angel questions?  Actually, I've been upstairs a few times (when they let us Angel writers out of the dungeon) and have seen some of Eric Radomski's characte
r designs for Animated Buffy.  Very, very cool lookin'.  Haven't heard about an air-date, but those suckers take a long time to draw, ya know..

<DD> Hey everyone!  So THIS is the Bronze, eh?  Nice place you have here.  I'm Scott, though you may know me as "the new writer-guy" on "Angel" (one of 'em anyway.)  I just thought I'd pop in f
or a quick drive-by to say "hey" and see if I can figure out how this color code thing works...
