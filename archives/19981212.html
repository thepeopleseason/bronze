Hey VT and anyone else thinking of bringing me Caramilk - I only need one or two.  Honestly.  I'm trying to watch my weight here.<BR>
<BR>
Nighthawk - Thanks.  And actually you may call me Mr. Kradnok.  Loopoo Kradnok.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Arymede - Kill Fer?  (please don't)<BR>

<BR>
Alpinefresh - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Kyle - a lot of fan mail would probably be an understatement.  I'm guessing here... hundreds of letters a week?  That sounds right...  maybe more.  I'll ask somebody.  And yes, much of that fan mail is indeed very unusual.  When I worked on "Second Noah" (ABC, what, 1995?) there were these twins - boys - actors on the show.  They were around 12 or 13 years old or so.  They got large numbers of fan mail from <i>prisons</i>.  Painting a picture for you I hope...

Isn't, like, getting last a big deal around here?<BR>
<BR>
I doubly rock!<BR>
<BR>
BuffyNerd - ROTFLOL!!!!  And thank you for the compliments, but mostly thank you for stalking me.  i am now stalkworthy.<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo, Jade, Fly-by-nite - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
VT - My mom stopped sending me Caramilk care packages a while ago.  Bring me one or two, wouldya?  (Mmmmmm....)  Thanks.

BISH - Nice, yes!<BR>
<BR>
Magdalen - ooh, thanks for noticing that.  One of my favorite parts.  (It's fun imitating Mark Snow.)  (Who is awesome BTW.)  The score is 99% sampled instruments.  I usually add a woodwind and another instrument depending on the show.<BR>

April - no score-only CD as of yet but I'm wroking on it.  There is hope.  Email TVT records (somebody post the link... please?) and tell them to put the B/A love theme on the (otherwise songs-only) CD if you feel strongly about it.<BR>
<BR>
SLaYeR, Lexy, Arsinoe - thanx<BR>
<BR>
Hey, I wanna see LP's SMG-not-posting reasons list.  Where where?  (sachiel?)<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo - I should probably refrain from giving anything but the official address - (which is c/o Fox or the WB network, no?) which you probably already have.  They probably get boatloads of fan mail, and I'm sure they read them all, but it sometimes takes time.  Sorry.  You can send me a picture of me though.  Come on, you know you want to.<BR>
<BR>
? - Yeah!<BR>
<BR>
Sachiel - it's easy.  You can play music, you can write music.  All you do is **** around until you play something you kinda like.  Done!   That's essentially all I do - really.  Only I have more noisemakers to do it with than you do.  But all you need is an instrument, and not even.  Haven't you ever whistled absent-mindedly?<BR>
<BR>
alucard - I am with you on the black character issue.  I'm sure they're trying.

Sarah W - Sorry.  I'm fully post-Ty, so I wouldn't know.  But I will give you a sympathy sigh.  *sigh*<BR>
<BR>
squireboy - I believe it was actually Gary Oldman from the "Sid & Nancy" soundtrack.  BUT I could be wrong.  Maybe check the Buffy Music Website?  Leslie's pretty on top of these things.<BR>
<BR>
Virago - see my post below.  The only time i ever felt overwhelmed was when I came on post-broadcast on a Tuesday night.  I like to come here to hang kinda casual like, and it was just a little too nutball.  But, like I said... Nobody's gonna wanna stalk a TV composer.  We are just not stalkworthy.  Though I was recognized about two months ago outside the hall in my studio... (A woman in a nieghboring office recognized me from a picture of me in the Hollywood Reporter.)  That's the first and only time it happened.  Far from being creepy it made me feel kinda... I dunno... famous?  I don't get to feel that way very often.  Though I'm sure being famous would get old pretty quickly.

VT, April - heya, thanks<BR>
<BR>
Mircalla - it is indeed a col<i></i>or that likes to be difficult.  Isn't it true that you can't rhyme "orange"?  Door hinge?<BR>
<BR>
Kyle - right back atcha with the huh? huh?  and as for SMG... I honestly can't speak for her but I'd guess she values her privacy, or at least the feeling of.  <BR>
<BR>
Jade - since you didn't ask let me just say that being a behind-the-scenes type makes it much easier for me to come here as often as I do.  Generally composers are not the type to need to worry about privacy... The truth is most people don't even notice the music (though I've received several messages from people on this board who have told me that my coming here has clued them in to the underscore - and for that I feel gratified) let alone the composer.  I honestly think if I were as universally and ubiquitously worshipped as SMG I wouldn't come here either.  (Are you listening Kyle?)<BR>
<BR>
SLaYeR - so what do I type then?<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo - I have nothing to do with picking the bands, but I will be sure to pass your compliments on to the people who do.  I write the background music.  You can compliment me on that if you feel like it.  I highly recommend it. <BR>
<BR>
(Oooh, feeling so self-satisfied tonight, aren't I... did I mention that I rock?)<BR>
<BR>
Gabrielle - <vipmagenta>You know, I think I remember magenta... this one actually might work...<BR>
<BR>
BISH - I'll take the lazy way and just say yes.

Cate - lol!  let's try it: <vipbasketball>is it BASKETBALL???<BR>
<BR>
(that looked very funny surrounded by those < >'s)<BR>
<BR>
Stephen - I hate maroon.  Now breathe.<BR>
<BR>
BISHOP - the difference between me and other VIP's:  I <i>live</i> for putting off work to an extent surpassed only by my wife (also a composer by the way).  Bronze, I dub thee Procrastinaville, USA.<BR>
<BR>
curlysue, sachiel - thanks, hi.<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo - Uhhh, (age-showing much?) who's RBF?<BR>
<BR>
Fly-by-nite - spoiler free huh?  Well, don't worry.  It's not a big scene at all.

Hmm, just tried listening to "The Wish" at Order of Hannigan (I assume that's what Lovely Poet was listening to) and got a "the requested URL is not valid" error from RealPlayer.  Error 23 or somethin.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - I think I'm pretty much restricted to blue (which I find hard to read so I never use), green, aqua, red, and yellow.  Unless I'm forgetting one.

<BR>
melanie - bonjour<BR>
<BR>
Sara the Brown - hi & thanks<BR>
<BR>
Lovely Poet - thanks.  I hope the quality of the sound wasn't too bad.  It's bad enough I have to compete with dialog & SFX (most of the time)...  It probably loses something in the translation to RealAudio.<BR>
<BR>
Leather Jacket - sorry to ruin your theory.  Umm, but wouldn't the guy saying stuff like "west 30 degrees" etc etc have ruined your theory much more overtly?<BR>
<BR>
And why doesn't SMG post?  She is such a hottie.

I'm in a good mood because I just had my first playback session for the director & producers of a film I'm working on ("Guinevere", Miramax, coming out in Sept 99 after a Sundance preview, NOT Arthurian, older man younger woman love story, Stephen Rae, Sarah Polley, Gina Gershon - that should cover likely questions).  And it went very very well.  Feeling like I rock pretty hard right now.<BR>
<BR>
Heya Sarah W. - thanks for coming by to say hi & guard me.  Yeah, I showed Fer the CBCC site.  He got a big kick out of it.  I also loved how Jennifer Lynn incorporated the CBCC mandate into her "12 days of Buffy" song. <vipcoral>Is it coral?  Probably not.  And thanks for the compliments...  And just you wait 'til the last 3 or so minutes of "Amends".<BR>
<BR>
Arymede <vipredyellow> - is it redyellow?  Probably not.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man, ? - <viptangerine> is it tangerine?  I doubt it.<BR>
<BR>
grr argh<BR>
<BR>
April - Now now now now!!!  This very second!!!<BR>
<BR>
Gabrielle - <vipyellowishred> is it yellowishred?  No way.<BR>
<BR>
CharileX - hey.

If anyone can provide me with some synonyms for "orange," maybe I could guess the code that would allow me to post in said col<i></i>or...<BR>
