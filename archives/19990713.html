Jeff: Hello - see you soon. Dinner is still a  possibility...I'll call. Love to Sophia<BR>
Haven: When the script says 25 vamps the first thing I do is go to the production manager to talk budget. We can do ANYTHINg if we have enough budget...<BR>
Jasmen: You are mistaken. I still have a full crew on Buffy, and there is a new crew on Angel.<BR>
~*Buffy*~: Those photos are done off set at another time with other artists. I can hazard a guess that it was a Stilla gloss(?)<BR>
Aly is my fav: Aly   is pretty all the time. How could a little rubber forehead hide that?

<DD> Buffy-ites, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. David De Leon who is one of the make-up artists on Angel. David has done Mr. Boreanez/ Miss. Hannigan and Ms. Carpenter for all the WB promo shoots for three years and has recently made it into the make-up union and landed the job on Angel.

<DD>michelle - yes ANGEL has begun.  From what I gather the first episode is done and they plan on starting the second when we start BUFFY (which should be very soon.)<BR>
<BR>
And Faith's stunt double is Karen Sheperd for Martial arts and Jennifer Badger for that final high fall.

<DD>michelle:  Hi.  Sarah called us a few weeks ago.  She says that she has had a great hiatus and has been traveling promoting her movie around the world.  She seemed to be in really good spirits and I think it was smart of her not to accept another movie this hiatus.  She really needed a break and I think it's done her some good.  Her energy is back to its usual high standard so I know that she'll be ready to go when we get back.<BR>
<BR>
One thing I can tell you about her is that she is always good to my stunt guys.  She treats them very well.  I also find it very easy to work with her.  She seems to trust me and she knows that I am watching out for her.

<DD> Oki'llbyte: We have a team of excellent make-up artists and we turn out two or three vamps each - and yes we do use an airbrush!<BR>
Ajo: Yes, I often teach make-up in my spare time and have done many Vamp demos. No private classes - sorry.<BR>
Werewolf, where wolf?: I'm really not sure wether the "horror" aspect of Buffy makes the extra cotrovery - "parents" love to blame the weird and odd for all their children's problems. I was caoght shoplifting and my Mom trew out all my Vamprella comics - where's the connection? Faith was wearing Smash Box lipstick, but the exact shade escapes me.<BR>
Spence: I see you major in math...<BR>
Meauviua: My best work? Surviving the season!<BR>
MW: Yes, I think the bleach plays havoc with Sarah's hair. And to answer for Jeff - you don't "haggle" with Joss. You present ideas and he makes a choice. End of story.

<DD>Hi Todd :)<BR>
<BR>
Sorry ... I had to run down the hall and fill out some paperwork.   I'm trying to have new heating and air installed and the guy is now telling me that he thinks it will cost four times more than he originally estimated it would.  So (already in an aardwolfish mood) I proceeded to show him out and he quickly relented and went back to his original price.  <BR>
<BR>
Salesmen!!!  <BR>
<BR>
Umm aardy wouldn't be a salesperson would he?  Just wondering...<BR>

Goodto see you again Todd and good point about Joss being our boss.  I've heard that he was the creator of that show we work on.  It must be true if you say it is;)</SMALL>

<DD> Haven: To tell you the truth, the technology has grown so fast it looses me sometimes! No, it is not like the old stop-motion days, we film the scene and take "reference footage" of the actor in the position where the morp happens. Then on an entirely different day we film the actor in make-up using a monitor to line him up with the previously shot footage, then the wizards of CGI do the actual mix.<BR>
Peri:How kind of you to notice. Yes, when Angel turned into Angelus, we made him paler, whited out his lips and added eyeliner. As for the plotlines of Angel - I have no idea....<BR>
aardwolf: To addd my 2 cents into a conversation I was not invited into, You must realize thet Jeff, like myself, is employed by Joss. Joss is the executive producer - ALL details -  even whether a character has eyeliner or not, or wheteher Trick buys bends or cries on a Uzi are Joss's decision - ask the boss.<BR>
AngleMan: Sorry to keep signing off on your IMs - I usually just sign on to get my e-mail as I rush onto another project. Yes, that last night was a huge effort and I thing we employed more extra help that day than ever before on the show!

<DD> Oz311: Well...I don't want to give away the secrets...but, a wonderful stunt man, Lee Whittaker. is the Oz double and Lee is usually in the wolf suit. Lee was also the lead "Devil Dog" in the prom episode.<BR>
MW: Buffy keeps being pushed back but I believe our first filming day will be the 23rd. I was a technical advisor on the Angel first episode, but I leave it in the capable hands of a good friend, Dayne Johnson (he won an Emmy with us on Buffy), and my partner, David De Leon. I'm back on Buffy.<BR>
Silver: Well, I'm not sure what you mean, In the fight sequences we have the actors in make-up and their stunt doubles also in make-up - but once it's all on, we just have to maintain it? Does that help?

<SMALL>(Tue Jul 13 21:34:01 1999 169.132.153.109)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Hi ... just stopped in to say that I think aardwolfe is a total jerk and a true idiot who loves to spout off about things of which he has no knowledge at all.  (I know - what else is new?)<BR>
<BR>
First of all the flaming bas<i></i>eball bat thing was something that I worked out with the director and was not something written by Ty. Rarely do we ever follow anything that is in the script when it comes to the fights.  It is all bas<i></i>ed on what I think Joss wants to have happen to the characters in the scene.  This info comes straight from him.  Some of the early drafts often do not even resemble BUFFY until he has re-written them.  I simply go off what he wants to have happen by talking directly to him before we shoot.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Trick did not fight with a "necktie."  I decided that he would use a strap from one of the crates to choke Buffy and slam her around.  I did this because:<BR>
<BR>
a) Joss had told me that she was to be out of it after being hit by the falling crate and would not be able to fight back well.<BR>
<BR>
b)  Mike Gershman (our DP) was directing and he prefers the more violent and less fancy version of fighting.  He was also the director of "Passion."  So I did what I thought both he and Joss would approve of.  (And they both did - very much)<BR>
<BR>
Finally - I have often done films that are wall-to-wall shoot-outs with machine guns.  I've even directed war scenes using real Armies firing live ammo from tanks.  I am quite capable of using an Uzi.  It is just that on BUFFY there is only one person who decides when I get to do a big stunt or when the battles are long and intricate or short and simple.  That person is Joss.  In tonights episode we deliberately did not work out any action choreography in advance.  Joss told me that it was not about the fight because he felt that he had already gotten his big fight between Buffy and Faith.  He just wanted Angel to punch a few guys and to have some of the stunt guys get shot by flaming arrows.  So that is exactly what we did.<BR>
<BR>
In two weeks when we go back to work he may tell me that he wants a very wild and stunt-filled fight with Buffy against 20 Vamps.  He may tell me that none of the vamps can do Martial arts or he may tell me that they all can.  He may tell me that they cannot even get a punch in on Buffy - or he may tell me that she is to be pummelled by one who is a master fighter or is incredibly strong or has some other power she is unaware of.  Anything could happen.  The bottom line is that the fights are very well deliniated by the characters involved in them and only one person gets to decide just what those characters motivations and abilities may be. That person is Joss.<BR>
<BR>
So there are only two things that determine what we do on the show. The first is the time and budget we have to shoot.  That is something that I already know that you have no understanding of since you are completely without any experience in actually making films.  The other thing that governs us is what mood Joss may be in that night.  Sometimes he feels like having Buffy leap up onto a building.  Other days he says that she can't.  Sometimes he thinks it would be cool to see Buffy bend a rifle.  Other times she can't force open a door.  I asked him about this and he told me that he just goes by what he thinks fits his story.  That's all.  So I will wait to see what he will want  us to do next.  Maybe nothing much.  Maybe something really wild.  Who can fathom the mind of Joss?  Not you aardwolfe.  Otherwise you would be Joss and not just some guy who whines alot.<BR>
<BR>
There you go genius.  Now "Drink me you putz!"<BR>

<DD> Shalazar: All the credit for Charisma's look goes to my assistant, John Maldonado, who looked after her for three seasons. My partner, David De Leon is her make-up artist for Angel, and if I do say so, I think you will find her even more beautiful than ever!<BR>
Willow: Yes, I do the vamp/monster make-ups also.<BR>
Thy Slayer: Thanks, <BR>
Kimi: Sarah's hair was reacting so badly to overtreatment that Lisa-Marie Rosenberg (her hairstylist) added a fall which looked very good this episode, I think.

<DD>Brewster VK:  Don't know about the ring.<BR>
<BR>
I think that the WB is just sensitive and they are trying their best to please everyone.  I'm sure they recall the big blow-up over Power Rangers and how we were destroying the youth of America.  Thus the V chip was born.  Boy, I sure remember seeing the network honchos sweating it out during hearings on TV violence.  It was ridiculous.  Really - politicians are the ones who stir things up and try to use terrible happenings to their advantage.  These kind of crimes go on no matter what is on TV at the moment.  No one seems to address the fact that the reason that those kids lost it was because they were tormented on a daily basis.  It was very serious to them and that is where the cause is to be found.  I've seen this happen before (it just has not been on the news)<BR>
<BR>
I only hope that they don't try to interfere with Joss' vision.  The reason that the show has been so critically acclaimed is because they allowed Joss the creative freedom to make his show his way and have stayed pretty much out of the creative side.  The moment that they feel the need to interfere is the moment that you'll begin to see BUFFY start to look like all those other formula shows out there.  I hope that they are too smart to fall into that trap.<BR>
<BR>
btw - The script for EARSHOT was something I thought would be helpful for kids to watch.  It clearly shows the turmoil that a kid in high school can feel and the message that comes through is  something that shouldn't be kept hidden.  It is a positive show and reveals more in some ways than a thousand discussions by news anchors ever could.<BR>
<BR>
When you see part 2 of the finale I'm sure that you'll agree with me that it is a show that has nothing to do with any of what has gone on in the news.  Pulling it was a bit of overreaction in my opinion.

<DD>Legal Lurker:  Then here is some more info for you to take to your friends...<BR>
<BR>
The stunt double for ANGEL in the "Rain Fight - Buffy vs. Angel" during second season  of BUFFY was the same guy who was Keanu's stunt double on MATRIX.  He can also be seen in other episodes playing various monsters.  And when during the behind-the-scenes promo for MATRIX you see Keanu talk about a difficult triple kick that he had to perform himself you can tell them that the footage that is shown is actually my Buffy Stuntman.  At the moment Woo Ping is working on a deal to direct more HK films, but he will be back to do two sequels to MATRIX later on.<BR>
<BR>
Another related bit:  Wesley Snipes stunt double in BLADE is the same black vampire you see cropping up on BUFFY during season 3.  He is also the stunt double that I used for the lead character on the SPRITE commercials.  He is going to take some of the wire gags I taught him and put them into the sequel of BLADE that is coming up soon.  At the moment he is filming a fight between himself and JET LI in a new movie called ROMEO (or something like that)  <BR>
<BR>
See... the stunt world is very tiny indeed.

<BR>
Nuala:We are so out of space on the BUFFY lot you wouldn't believe it.  It is hard to even walk between sets because there is no room for all of the equipment we have.  The parking lot is used over and over and is being made into more Sunnydale locations.  It is really tight at the moment.<BR>
<BR>
Amy M:  Working on the show is fun except for the times when Joss shows up and beats us with that metal rod of his.  I don't mind really.  I find it insprational.  I just hate it when he decides to heat it up in an open flame before the beatings.  To me that's excessive.. and yet oddly entertaining to the cast and crew for some reason.

<DD> Biohaz:  If it is the stunt coordinator of MATRIX you are wondering about his name is YUEN WOO PING.  He and I had dinner before he did that movie and he included one of the wire gags that I designed originally for POWER RANGERS on MATRIX.  (It is the one where the actors fly towards each other and lock up wrist to wrist and spin around in the air.  WOO PING picked that up from the behind the scenes footage of me doing it in front of a green screen.  He liked it so much that he put it in his show)<BR>
<BR>
WOO PING is one of the oldest stunt coordinators in the kung fu movie industry and is responsible for choreographing JACKIE CHAN'S early traditional kung fu movies like SNAKE IN EAGLES SHADOW.

<DD>BellaD:  I think the fight that I put together for the actor who plays "Quick" (plus the stuff my guys did with Dustin) will be an improvement for VIP, but I wouldn't expect it to be THAT much better.  When we did a slow motion walk through for them they asked us to "slow it down for camera."  That is a bad sign.  Plus we did a lot of things that I could tell the cameara was completely missing, but since I am not the stunt coordinator of the show I can't really say anything.  You'll see me standing there with a rocket launcher waiting for what seems like a year for the girl to kick me.  They made us do that.  They said that the audience can't keep up with anything that doesn't have a long pause between hits.  It was pretty bad.  Made me look forward to BUFFY again.<BR>
<BR>
I did get to do all of the cool angles for the wire gags on the SPRITE commercials that I wanted and had them edited properly too.   We out-did MATRIX on those spots.  I hope you get to see them.

<DD>Circe:  Actually I didn't get to work on ANGEL.  They had to move it off our studio lot which would make it impossible for me to be on both shows at the same time.<BR>
A friend of mine coordinated the pilot and he will be turning it over to another guy soon.  The funny thing is (and I don't think that Joss even knows this) the guy doesn't know anything about Martial arts and has never choreographed Martial arts before.  He gave them a fake tape  of fights that were choreographed by the Hong Kong team on MartiAL LAW.  He was not even on the set when those fights were made.  I sort of jumped on him about it the other day and he promised not to do it again.  He's going to go back to MartiAL LAW and continue his work as the guy who hires the Americans for the Hong Kong Team.  The guy replacing him also does not know Martial arts, but with my stunt guys from BUFFY working there they will continue to do what they did on the pilot and make sure the fights work well.  (although it does tick them off a bit that they won't get any credit for it - they just want to work, so they'll keep doing it)  I'll give them credit though whenever I am asked who choreographed what fight on ANGEL.  It's only right and I don't think anyone will mind.  Honesty is still number one in my book.  I say give credit where credit is due.  I mean, how would Joss feel if some other guy crossed out his name on an original script he wrote and inserted his own?  You get my point I'm sure.

<DD>Lena:  Yeah Sophia told me that she saw him while she was working on that Robert DeNiro film.  We've run into quite a few Buffy people this summer.  I talked to Dayton during the commercial shoot.<BR>
<BR>
Brewster VK: Rarely.  Most of the time it's just concrete.

<DD>KarenT:  Sophia will be in that magazine in future issues too.  <BR>
<BR>
Wherewolf:  James did stop by the house because he wanted to get into a stretching program to loosen himself up for future fight scenes.  I guess that means he'll be around.  That makes me really happy.  He's one of the greatest guys to work with that I've ever met.  I wish Joss would create a show for Spike and Oz.  I love those two.

<DD>BellaDonna:  I started working on a series of SPRITE commercials before BUFFY even wrapped.  I shot 5 in all.  They are airing on MTV right now and star some Rap artists.  Each 30 second spot is like a mini kung fu movie with about 6 wire stunts in each one.  They will probably keep airing through the whole summer.<BR>
<BR>
I also just choreographed some fights for VIP.  They are adding actor Dusten Nyguen to the cast to jazz up their ... (ahem)*  'fight action' this season.<BR>

<DD>CB:  Wouldn't that be the shocker of all time?  Especially if Anna Nicole caught the hoticlerocis from Angel.

<DD>Hello... I hope this still works.  I haven't been online since December.<BR>

In response to Cates observation of David B:  My understanding is that David suffers from some sort of overheating problem that is not unlike the cooling malfunctions of an old Corvair.  Thus the need for constant removal of the shirt to prevent unwanted steaming up of the camera lens.  Doctors in Sweden call it 'hoticlerocis.'  It often strikes during a sweeps period -btw.
