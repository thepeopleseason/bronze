<DD><i>next to last...</i><BR>
<BR>
Rum Spike: What's to forgive? My advice would be to write melodies to go with the lyrics. Hook up with other musicians through friends or trade papers and just get out there and let people know who you are. Good things will follow if you believe.<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Seems like it already is a hit!<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen: I think that I'M busy but I've got nuthin' on John. He rocks!<BR>
