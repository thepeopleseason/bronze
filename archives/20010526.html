<DD>Leaving am I, but let's talk crossovers.  No plans for one right now, but they are not ruled out forever.  Better to let the shows get started on there own, but someday.... in the meanwhile, I have a thrilling noncrossover planned that should drive you guys insane.  As far as continuity, Angel will deal with the ramifications of Buffy's death and all that comes after, but we'll definitely be focussing on the unbelievably intense problems he's gonna have at home.  i.e. Non Buffy watchers will still get the show, but we'll be true to the past.  <BR>
<BR>
And now I must go.<BR>
<BR>
I am gone.<BR>
<BR>
Hmmm mmmmnnm, mmmhm, dum da dum -- whah?  No!  I'm gone!  I wasn't -- I didn't lurk, who said --<BR>
<BR>
Forget it.  I'm GOING, okay?  You don't have to nudge.

<DD>I think the WB is rerunning Buffy wednesdays at 9:00 and on the weekends as well.<BR>
<BR>
And I probably won't be dancing in the musical -- I tried to think of a Numfarcentric storyline but it all turned out to be about those buffy characters.  Sigh...

<DD>Plot holes?  Hmmm.  First of all, we started setting up in ep 13 that Buf and Dawn were true blood relations, that their blood was the same, not just similar, so the portal would be sated when EITHER stopped flowing.  Second, nobody ever took orders from the Buffybot.  Buffy gave the gang the speech in the magic shop then went down to change clothes with the bot.  At the sight of the tower you hear Buffy give willow an order and then SEE the bot.  You never see the bot speak because the offscreen, that-whiyte-sweater-was-supposed-to-be-pink Buffy actually said it.<BR>
<BR>
And the spoilers below are, uh... if you had a male cow, and that cow was given something to eat, sometime later there might be, um...well the spoiler is wrong.

<DD>Slayergrl199:  Exciting though that sounds, I'm actually on vacation.  But thanks again all for helping spread the good word.<BR>
<BR>
Musicals are harder to write than other things.  I think I'm in over my head.  Heh-heh.

That all probably would have seemed more realistic with an alias.  Truth is, though:  We're BONED!  Everyone keeps saying the show is over no matter how many times we tell them it's not.  As Marti (and Kai) pointed out, I feel like Spike explaining the Ben/Glory connection.  It's just like people to assume a story is over just because the hero is rotting in her grave.  Sheesh.
