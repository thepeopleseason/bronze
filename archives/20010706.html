<DD> Okay, loyal Bronzers, this has certainly been a more enjoyable little chat than that last fiasco.  Thanks again for your interest and for putting up with me while I learn how to work this crazy new computer thang.<BR>
Sarah's Carl: Mere is actually next door, writing her episode, so I'll forward your message. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone have a great weekend, and I'll try to stop in again soon!

<DD> I have time for one more post, and them I must be off.  In the meantime, if you haven't already, may I heartily recommend checking out the followinig comics, which went on sale yesterday: Joss's "Fray" #2 (even better than the first issue) and Daredevil: Yellow #2, written by comic-God (and Buffy animated show-runner) Jeph Loeb.

<DD> Sarah's Carl: Thanks for your interest in my torrid past.  You can see a little bit of my history at www.scoobygang.com<BR>
<BR>
You'll be seeing more of Fred, but I'm not sure what her official status is going to be.  I think "regular" but don't quote me on that.  (I just do the writing.  I'm not making the deals.)<BR>
<BR>
Hey angelvoice:  Since they haven't told me otherwise I guess I can tell you what we're doing next season: It seems that Angel and the gang-- hold on, Joss, Tim and David G. just came into my office...<BR>
<BR>
Okay, it seems that I canNOT tell you what we're doing next season (upon pain of extreme bondage and torture; and not the fun kind.)  Acutally, I can tell you that there's a general feeling that we want to emphasize the "action" thing a little more this season; not have the "A"-man quite so broody.  Hope that helps.

<DD> DeAn:  Ah, Mr. Fury warned me about you...  I'll work on the "all-naked Angel" idea, but I think I'd better write a more traditional "all-clothed one" first.  Just to establish some cred with the people that hired me.<BR>
<BR>
Christopher Marlowe: Nice work on the plays.  You know, all the ones that they think "what's-his-name" actually wrote.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323: Sorry about not being able to name a favorite character.  I guess I have too much love for just one of them.  Fav. eps?  I'd have to say: Buffy: "The Body" (natch) "Hush" (too cool a story) and "Bad Girls" (Faaaith... drool...) Angel: "Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been"  (If I can write an Angel even half as cool as that ep. I'll be one happy guy.)<BR>

<DD> DeAn and Chalkdusty: Hey, don't fight.  Plenty of shirts to go around for everyone.  <BR>
<BR>
sings in the car: I am actually "on staff" as a writer here on "Angel"  (I know, pretty damned lucky, eh?)  I think my official title is "story editor" but it's all just writin'.<BR>
<BR>
chalkdusty: my favorite character?  At the risk of sounding wishy-washy, I'm gonna say that the great thing about writing for this show in particular is that ALL the characters as so cool and have such distinct voices.  I love 'em all and want to write witty, cool stuff for them all to say and do.

<DD> Chalkdusty:  Hmmm... If Steve takes off his pants and if Drew takes off his socks.  What if I take off my shirt?  That way, if all three of us are in the Bronze, it'll be a big naked-fest?<BR>
<BR>
Ari: Chocolate or Caramel?  Despite Drew's persuasive argument for the latter, I gotta go with chocolate.  Since I don't drink coffee, it's the one source of imbibable energy that I have grown to depend on.

<DD>Hola!  Sorry I couldn't be around today.  Had to do my sweet Buffy thang.  The home computer's been dismantled for the move, so I'll have to try to catch up with you guys next week.  Hope I can go that long without a fix.<BR>

<DD> Hey AussieBulldog!  One of the joys of this job is that we get to sit around and say "What if we could get..." And then name our favorite movie star.  There are lots of possibles, but I'll go out on a limb and say somebody I'm pretty sure we'd never get.  I think Nic Cage would be a pretty bitchin' fangster, don't you?

<DD> Hey there!  Hookay, once more into the breach...  <BR>
<BR>
You're very welcome tiggy.  The story I'm working on is currently scheduled to be episode number 5.  That is, if the "Powers That Be" (aka, Joss, David G., and Tim) sign off on it.

Evalie:  Sorkin is in the same jerk boat as West.  And extra shame on John Wells (president of the WGA for crying out loud) for defending him.  If this weren't a family board...

<DD>Just one more quick post before I fly to sort out this anti-color conspiracy.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  How much do you ROCK?  Got the stack 'o Variety and handed them out like candy.  Also got a package that I think was meant for Joss but addressed to me.  Don't worry -- I'll make sure he gets it when he returns from liv
ing the high life.  Thanks again -- you're the best!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Be back as soon as I can.

<DD>Ahhh!  The color has been drained out of me (actually this happened years ago, right around the time of my immaculate albino birth).  I'll try to sort this out and pop back in as soon as I can.  Until 
then, somebody spin me a tale about this imposter that's making my life a black and white living hell.

working now.  Smack!

<DD>Hola, Bronzers!  I'll be in and out of meetings all day again, and I'm moving this weekend, so here's the sweet dealio -- I'll drop in all day today whenever I have a free minute.  I'll answer as m
any questions as I can, but today's going to be extra funky (just the way Superfly likes it).<BR>
<BR>
Hello Tiggy, keeper of all that is good and photogenic!<BR>
<BR>
Evalie:  I sense your need for answers.  Bring it on!
