<DD>Hey everyone.  Thanks for the posts, but I'm afraid duty calls.  As asked, I'm available by e-mail at www.christophergolden.com (which desperately needs to be updated as soon as I get stuff to little willow).  Also, please read the FAQ before asking writing questions.<BR>
<BR>
As for Polgara -- You've all seen the last of her.  Mwahahaha.

<DD>Brandi--nice to meet you too.<BR>
<BR>
mere--e-mail me if you have a chance.  I've read the first few Angel scripts, and I had a couple of questions.<BR>
<BR>
Greengirl & LouWho--You guys are in trouble, too.<BR>
<BR>
DavidFan--good deal.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus--things are going well.  Busy as usual.  Writing right now.  Will have to go in a couple of minutes.

<DD>Polgara--I was teasing about the pretty boy actors!  Some of my good friends are pretty boy actors.  Okay, well, one.  Grrrr.  *g*<BR>
<BR>
BellaDonna:  Actually, yes, there is a Mrs. Chris.  And if I shared that description with her, she'd laugh her ass off.  Trust me, if I lived in the Old West, it'd be nuthin' fancy.<BR>
<BR>
Lab--bitingpeople?  me?  Only by request.  ;)</SMALL>

<DD>Kim!  you could e-mail me with a question if you have one.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Hello:  Ask Apollo.  *shrug*  I just do what I'm told.  Also Lab and Polgara<BR>
<BR>
Krypt--I'm editing an anthology of Hellboy stories called "Odd Jobs."  There is a story in there by Mignola and me.  Oh, and someday, I may actually write that second Hellboy novel.  It's called "The Phantom Inquisitor," but who knows if it'll ever see print.<BR>
<BR>
Polgara--you are SO dead.  Be careful, or I'll tell everyone how old you'll be on your birthday.

<DD>Lab--You're worse than my Mom!  : )<BR>
<BR>
Polgara--see, now you're just teasing me.  You join the ranks of they who must be punished.

<DD>hey to kenickie and lena.<BR>
<BR>
Lab--I'm actually writing the fifth Body of Evidence in between posts here.  But you, girl, are in for a serious spanking.  : )<BR>
<BR>
BellaDonna:  not really the earring type, I don't think.  Or the Tudor outfit type, to be honest.  More of a duster/boots and spurs Old West guy, if dress-up's your thing.  *s*

<DD>Oh!  My!  God!<BR>
<BR>
JUST STOP IT!  *blush blush*  At Labrynth's urgings, I checked into the board a minute ago, and, okay, someone is very seriously deranged around here.
