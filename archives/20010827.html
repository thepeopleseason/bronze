<dd>Tiggy:  I heard the siren's call and couldn't resist.  And a healthy dose of the procrastination, of course.  Finally got the chance to return your e.  Sorry for the delay.  <br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Steve bench press Drew!  Then Steve smash Drew!<br><br>Cashmere:  Halloween ep humming along.  As for Spike, well, what does that fella need pants for anyway?  Oh, no wait -- that's me.<br><br>Karmic:  Drew is under my power.  Everytime I ring a bell he strips down to his socks and reenacts Washington's crossing of the Delaware.  Ring ring!<br><br>Allyson: Still looking for that glowing appendage.  Hmm.  So much for the family board.<br><br>

<dd>Narrator: I was counting  my loose change and misplaced a penny.  Perchance you found it in your shoe?<br><br>Tiggy:  What's cooking, mama?<br><br>

<dd>And wouldn't you know -- getting called to lunch.  I'll lurk past after if I get a chance and see if you're around, Tiggy. <br><br>And for the rest of you -- POKE POKE!<br><br>

<dd>Not really here.  Just lurking and spotted my favorite Tiggy bouncing about.  Hey, sweetness, how's it going?<br><br>

<dd>Narrator: Mr. Gordo dropped out at the last minute.  But remember that pig Suzanne Sugarbaker had?  The one she always left in the care of Consuela?  I'm not saying anything one way or the other.  Just, you know...big comeback.<br><br>Shpa, Adri: Miss Kitty is DEFINITELY not gone.  She's still around, and you might see her making a little trouble.  Especially with Suzanne's pig running around.<br><br>And on that note, sweeties, I think it is time for me to take my leave...must get ready for Ebert and Roeper -- hors d'oeurves to make, couch doilies to arrange (the fun never stops here at Chez Greenberg).  Good chattin with you all, lookin forward to talkin with you all again soon, cool?  Take care in the meantime!<br><br>

<dd>Allyson: Whoops, missed one.  Don't know the director yet, but should know very soon.  And, er...rock star treatment?  You mean I get to have someone pick out the brown M&Ms FOR me??  Dude, I LOVE this!!<br><br>DeAn: Well, do you think they're porn?  I know what you mean, though I (and this is just my personal philosophy stuff, bore, bore, snooooooze) tend NOT to think of them that way, both the US and the UK versions, cos they didn't show anything you wouldn't see between boys and girls on other shows, it's just that this was all boys, you know what I mean?  Okay, maybe the one shot in my episode of the two guys having sex on the glass desk with the camera under the glass desk pushed the envelope a LITTLE.  But, you know.  I looked at it as an experiment in physics.  And, to answer your question (huh, what, Drew's back on point again?  when?  why?), I've heard some people say the US version was actually MORE explicit than the UK version.  Jinkies!<br><br>Shpadoinkle: Why, I do declare, y'all flatter me, what with your smooth-talkin' 'bout the heat an' such.  Go on with y'all.  No, seriously.  Go on.<br><br>Talie: No Dr. Who fans... probably wouldn't translate that well here.  But Michael, who was Vince in the UK, was a big comic book fan.  I guess they're kind of related.  Sort of.<br><br>tiggy: Red light!  Red light!  Oops, wrong film strip.  My bad.<br><br>Paks: See?  I'm doing fine...umm, is it warm in here, or...??  :)<br><br>

<dd>Cash: I'm serious.  Clowns.  Pies.  Frivolity. <br><br>Hey, Buggo!<br><br>Paks: I'm told mid-November for airing.<br><br>Talie: QAF changed a lot in some ways when they Americanized it -- I think the biggest adjustment had to do with taking a story that was 8 eps and turning it into a 22-episode season, so that meant a lot of expansion for some of the minor characters, and also some deeper exploration of the main triangle.  I agree, by the way, that the Channel 4 QAF was one of the most exciting, groundbreaking things to hit British TV in a long, long time.<br><br>tiggy:  Tiggy, Tiggy, Tiggy.  Dear, sweet Tiggy.  I will not bow to your peer pressure.  Nay, I shall remain strong and true and -- wait, I'm just kidding!  Come back, cool kids!  Come back!  Look, I can sling iron!  I can go pantsless!  Awww.<br><br>Hey, I also wanted to chime in and say, I know that some of you have tried sending stuff to me -- just wanted to make sure you all know that it takes extra-long when it goes through the network, don't want you to be disappointed if you haven't heard back from me yet, it just takes so darn long to get to us.  But I do check my mailbox every day.  Every.  Single.  Day.  Stupid empty mailbox.<br><br>
