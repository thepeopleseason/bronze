<dd>Hey there!<br>Just wanted to pop in and say a <br>quick good-bye to all of you.  From <br>now on, there's going to be one <br>less writer on the "Angel" staff.<br><br>Yes, I'm afraid this is adios, <br>adiosu, arrivederci, and au <br>revoir...<br><br>It looks like yours truly is going <br>to be following in the footsteps of <br>Eliza Dushku, Seth Green, and Marc <br>Blucas.<br><br>No, that's not to say I'm going to <br>suddenly become really sexy....  <br>Actually, I'm going to be leaving <br>Angel and pursuing work in the <br>movies...<br><br>I've written a screenplay that the <br>good people over at Miramax say <br>they'd like to produce, (that sound <br>you hear is me knocking on wood), <br>so I'm pulling up stakes here and <br>setting my sights on the silver <br>screen.<br><br>In parting, I'd like to leave with <br>some big ole thanks to the <br>following:<br>To David Greenwalt, for reading my <br>work and giving me the chance to <br>join the party for a while.<br>To Tim Minear for being a great <br>writer, and for being the patron <br>saint of the lower-level staff.<br>To Mere & Jeff for being wonderful <br>fellow writers and compadres.<br>To everyone in the Angel office <br>staff, the Angel actors, and those <br>cool upstairs neighbors on that <br>little UPN show.<br>And, of course, to Joss for being a <br>great visionary, smart writer, <br>funny guy, and all-around nice <br>human being.<br><br>And lastly to all of you out there <br>in the Fan community.  So much <br>writing is done in solitude and <br>it's been great fun to see my work <br>discussed, praised, ridiculed, and <br>debated here in cyberland.  You're <br>surely an interesting group of <br>folks.<br>See ya at the movies.<br><br>
