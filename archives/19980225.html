<dd>X-Lander - - I am so much not the soundtrack guy. Ask RD. Better yet, don't ask, demand he tell you. And, if he claims ignorance, don't buy it. Threaten him if he continues to hold out on you. Then, follow through on that threat...<br>
<br>
<br>
Wait, RD may not know. Never mind. I only know I don't know.<br>
<br>
Ember - - I meant for this season. I never look beyond today. If Joss will have me back... and move the production up to Seattle, I'm in. I love writing for Buffy. I can say no more - I I don't want Joss to kick me off the board again.<br>
<br>
GylzGirl - - Nahhh, I don't. Not really. Ya think so? Nah. (thanks, I try to)<br>
<br>
Buff1f - - Thank you. But all the credit goes to Robia, who needed killing. j/k... oh, god, j/k<br>
<br>
Trigger - - I would love to claim credit for the voice-over idea, but Joss came up with that. I can only claim to have helped write the actual words.<br>
<br>
Moriah - - You're welcome. Love to watch that X-man move. Although I never took my eyes off of Sarah... because it was about her, of course. But, I did write the Snoopy Dance line with ya'll in mind.<br>
<br>
abpesq - - Sorry I missed you. Ignore what I said about my future with Buffy, BTW. And, I know you've been asked this before, but... "abpesq"?<br>
<br>
sigh... a truism in Hollywood - no one ever licks the writers... :-(<br>

Darkwind - - The correct form is "When I do badly in English..." Thanks for listening. :-)&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Knightwatch - - Big wavey back. See you at the PBFP, whenever it is?<br>
&nbsp; <br>
RD - - Yes, we record the episodes, then freeze frame on your credit and just watch it until we get sleepy. Then, we turn off the TV and all the lights and go to bed happy.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Skyler - - If it was an attached file, I can no longer download those. A virus wreaked (sp.?) havoc on my computer last month and I have sworn off them. Sorry.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Ember - - Even when the eps are written, we still discuss what we can do to torture the viewers. Sometimes, we just have all night, call people at home and hang up when they answer sessions... with weapons. Toward the end of the season, scripts are written shortly before being shot (sometimes, they come in two days or so before cameras roll). Joss has everything in his head, though. Usually, eps are written two to four weeks before cameras roll. I think. Ask RD, he knows better. I do know that BBB was written by poor, overworked, but brilliant Marti Noxon mere days before it was shot (due to Sarah's appearance on SNL, ya know). And this season, the second ep was written before the first. It happens. And, I'll bet I didn't answer your question at all.&nbsp; <br>

<dd>tanya*~ - - No, my writing days at BtVS are through. I'm going out on "Passion." You know what they say... always leave 'em laughing.<br>
<br>
kate228 - - Nope. RD would know who wrote "Killed by Death." RD, was it "the boys"? Or Marti? Anyway, no more Buffy for me. This episode nearly got me killed.<br>
<br>
Cynthialil - - You probably do know the ep better than me. I've only seen it once all the way through. I'm too much the perfectionist, and only see the warts. And, not being a big fan of warts, I turn away.<br>
<br>
Alex - - Sorry for the misleading spoiler. What was I thinking? ;-)<br>

TechZero - - Don't give up hope. If Hollywood will hire me, that means somebody's desperate. <br>

<dd>Dr. S - - Mediocre English grades were a result of often odd and twisted writing. Once wrote a creative fiction writing paper in the first person describing how I, as a nine year old, went to court to win custody of my younger, Thalidomide quintuplet brothers after the death of my mother. I know, not very nice. But, I remember lines like "I could only find comfort in the fact that my mother never saw the plane that hit her" and "On the front row of the courtroom, my brothers, unable to clap for me, nonetheless applauded with their eyes." Sick stuff for a nine year old. The only blemish on otherwise pretty A filled report cards.<br>

<dd>TechZero - - Having your name in the credits is very cool. I like to imagine that everyone I ever went to school sees it and says "Hey, I knew that guy!" Second coolest thing is getting to use old friends and family members' names as characters in scripts. Didn't get to do that for "Passion", but almost every name in SAR came from people I went to school with, and my niece... and the two names of school's mentioned (Fondren and Westbury) were the names of my middle school and my wife's high school. Of course, there's something cool about writing something that ends up in someone's English paper, too. Just when teacher's thought they had heard the last from me. :-)<br>
<br>
Kel - - Whoa, very flattered. Thank you. Like RD, not much luck in English in school. So, this feels kind of like revenge to know I'm affecting an English paper in some way. Thanks.<br>
<br>
microserf - - Haven't seen horrorshow used in a sentence in years. Takes groodies (okay, not a proper usage) to use C.O. speak in a post.<br>

<dd>SPOILERS - SPOILERS<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunnydale Sleuth - - The scene was once longer, but only because I wrote too many words. Very purple prose, very melodramatic. I think (could be wrong), that it was Sarah and Michael's idea to do a take or two where she hit Tony, then hugged him without all the overwritten monolog in between. Never saw the other version, but would be willing to bet this was better. With better words, the scene might've been longer, but it worked for me. Sometimes, passion isn't unleashed through words, but through human contact. And, the move from violence (the punch) to desperation (the hug) without words was incredibly powerful. At that moment, Buffy was as scared as I've seen her in a while. I think that lack of control (giving in to the passion of the moment) was incredibly scary for her, and, as much as anything, lead to her declaration shortly thereafter that she must never again give in to passion. It was one of those moments I can't take credit for - bravo to Sarah and Tony and Michael. (And all bravo's belong to Joss eventually)<br>

<br>
kate - - "Is there anything in 'Passion' that is [mine]?" Yikes. Have I been too self-deprecating? RD can chose to back me up (or not), but most of the script is mine, if that's what you mean. And, the sketches done by Angel, and most of the music, and I was the stunt double for Giles and cleaned up after "Sunshine." I also made the tasty sandwiches the cast and crew enjoyed during each filming break and built the film camera from a Radio Shack kit.<br>

<br>
As to the question of Angel in Giles' home: it was never seen onscreen, but there was a period where Angel and Giles worked closely together (remember around the time of the Codex, when Giles had Angel's phone number?). Giles alluded to needing to "do" his house when he got the book from Willow at Buffy's house. So, even though it was never on the air, he was there. Kind of like how you never saw Giles getting Angel's phone number or Xander finding out where he lived. Lot of living going on for these guys between Tuesdays. And, Joss alone knows what it is.<br>

<dd>Ac , went to spend some time answering e-mail while waiting to hear from George, but AOL won't let me in the mailroom.<br>
<br>
Amy - - The "poem" Angel recited was written just for the show, which means it was some me, some Joss. I named the episode "Passion", so it was just supposed to be a sort of general musing on the state of passion, in particular how it related to what all of the characters were going through. It was sort of a theme thing. Angel, Buffy, Giles... Joyce, Willow, Xander... all the characters were driven through this episode by different passions, be it lust or revenge or longing or fear. To me, Xander's lines in Giles' apartment were the culmination of several feelings toward Angel - jealousy, betrayal, etc. But, also, I think his relationship with Cordelia made the act of Angel's killing Giles' girlfriend hit home more than if he had not experienced that relationship. For the first time, he and Giles might have had something in common. So, he connected with Giles on that level, and the controlled rage of the speech came from that. <br>
<br>
Too much talk. Not enought writing.<br>
<br>
I will respond to e-mails ASAP. Deadlines have to come first, though. Sorry.<br>

~mere~ - - Don't want to get into it, because you scare me, but I don't think it is possible that you liked the Jenny Calendar character more than I did. And I have never had more sad moments while writing a script than I did while writing that scene. Believe it or not, I guess I won't convince you otherwise. In an odd way, she was my favorite part of BBB. Ask George if I teared up in editing when Angel killed her. And again when Giles got home. And again when Buffy and Willow got the news, and again and again.<br>

<dd>Jeff knows better about the chase scene, but it was only a half page long in the script. Not much detail. Jenny runs, hits a locked door, jerks it open just before Angel gets there, slams it in his face, hits a cleaning cart, knocks Angel down with it, he heads her off at the top of the stairs. Again, Joss' faith in the other professionals to make the scene sing paid off.<br>

Brad: We did shoot that line that Ty wrote though. I thought it was great. Sometimes things are trimmed a bit a atime to get the show to its proper length. I'd love to see a directors cut of all the BUFFY shows (or a Joss cut without network censorship at all) <br>

<dd>Nittany Lion - - I'm finished, as far as writing Buffy eps for this season. Prior commitments have me busy. Besides, "Passion" feels like a good one to go out on. And, in a nutshell, I got my start writing for shows like "Family Ties" and "Newhart" as a very young lad.<br>
<br>
As for the music choice as Giles enters his place, I didn't describe any particular piece of music. I think it was Joss' choice to go with "La Boheme", although I don't want to step on toes if it was Michael G.'s selection. <br>

<dd>Nittany: We have 3 more to shoot (not counting the one we are on now)&nbsp; We did postpone a scene one night due to rain.	<br>

CD1106 - I hear it is around 1.6 million (but I don't really know for sure)&nbsp; (How much does an ep cost to make?)<br>

<dd>thebeak: Don't worry. Ty is going to be right there on the lot (from what I hear) Me? Who knows? If Joss doesn't want me for his stunts then maybe he'll at least let me cut his grass. <br>

<dd>Ty: Don't they tell you these things up there? All of the Buffy scenes are done in one night only. C'mon. We only have 8 days y'know? What are we XENA over here?<br>

<dd>Ty: I was glad to see Sarah with so much energy that night. She did get off a couple of kicks. <br>
<br>
The fire was very time-consuming. As we knew it would be. But it created the atmosphere that you intended. It was intense. I used fire gel on Davids face and the face of Mike Massa and yet they were both covered in marks fro the spray from the burning baseball bat. Pretty tough on them.<br>
<br>
Sophia was very bruised up from the slam against the rail when she hung by one arm after being thrown over by Angel. Plus it was hard to breathe in there all night. Still --- a rockin' good time for us. hehe<br>
<br>
Micheal 770: Gersh deserves that honor. The show has the best "look" on tv I think.<br>

<dd>JEFF - - The Factory sequence looked like you had five days to shoot it. Now, increase my awe of you and tell me how many days you really had.<br>
<br>
ANOTHER LITTLE NUGGET - SPOILER<br>
<br>
The phone call scene with Aly and Sarah that left me teary-eyed - Joss asked me to write dialog for Giles on the other end of the phone and actually had Tony hooked up and speaking the news of Jenny's death over the wire to them. Hence the amazing realistic and heart-tugging acting they provided through the window.<br>
<br>
Michael G. - - Now that I've seen it, I'd love to talk. All good, gushy talk.<br>
