<DD><small>well then Kristen has to go and show up...</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Kristen</b>: FANTABULOUS site, Miss Thing. i think you may be my only rival for Scariest Stalker of Joss.  and yes, they pay me to be here -- but then i have to pay Joss not to pursue the restraining order, so it all evens out.<BR>
<BR>
now.  i'm leaving.  and i really, really, really mean it this time.  really.  for real.<BR>

<DD>hi <b>Ron</b>!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Freddy</b>: oh, but i'm <i>terribly</i> frightening, can't you tell?  don't the stuffed animals on my computer give that away?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Narrator</b>: actually, i'm glad you brought that up.  yes, Joss directed my very first produced episode of television.  so... well, it basically comes down to the fact that i don't ever get what i want ever ever again.  i've used up my quota of Dreams That Come True.  however, when you see the show, please understand that any funny lines, any touching moments, any cool action -- anything that is even <i>remotely</i> absent of suck -- was written by Joss.  <BR>
<BR>
<small>although i did have a "the" on page 17!  go me!</small><BR>

yet another p.s.: must go.  must pretend to be working when Greenwalt comes in.

<DD><b>Closet B</b>: GIRLIE!  so good to see you!  well, you know, see the electronic particles bouncing off the plasma of my monitor representing ideas that you must have translated through the clever use of keystrokes and fiber optics.  so... uh... yeah.  good to see you.  where was i going with this?<BR>
<BR>
oh, right.  dusting.  please feel free to be my own personal house attorney (light dusting and occasional window cleani-- oh, wait.  i got that part covered).<BR>

<DD><b>TaraAnyaKate4eva</b>: sorry, schmoops.  my intent was never to scare -- only to inform, titillate, dangle, and annoy.  if i wanted to scare you, i would've shouted, "BUSH FOR PRESIDENT!"

<DD>hello, y'all!<BR>
<BR>
just ducking in to say "hi" and OMIGOD (wait until you see this season!) and to make one small announcement:<BR>
<BR>
<b>deadguy</b>: wanted to let you know that there's a small shoutout from me to you in the new issue of the Buffy fan mag.  the opportunity presented itself, and i ripped you off shamelessly.  hopefully you won't be inundated with freaky e-... just remember it was done with lurve.<BR>
<BR>
kisses, smoochies, osculations, and other lip-related friendliness,<BR>
