<dd>Okay folks (rubbing hands together).  A few last things before I go:<br><br>Thanks to Kristen for her help with the pretty colored writin'.<br><br>Chianne: I think you'll probably see Fred become gradually less insane, as she gets used to being back in this dimension.  (Though she'll certainly be no less charming, quirky and beautiful.)<br><br>Princess of Darkness: I'd be most happy to do an interview for your website.  But why don't we wait until early next year?  That way, I should have more than one episode shown, so that'll give me more to talk about.<br><br>Lastly:<br>Scott's insider tip of the week: The episode after next (Angel 3.6 "Billy") is one of the coolest, darkest, scariest, most thought-provoking Angel episodes I've seen.  (At least if the script and dailies are any indication.)  And no, I didn't write it.  Credit resident geniuses Tim Minear and Jeffery Bell for it.  Set those VCR's!<br><br>Now I'm off to try and figure out what to do with episode 12...<br><br>Have a great weekend!<br><br>

<dd>Artemis & Impaler General:  Well, *somebody's* been reading the shooting scripts haven't they?  Yes, there was a big sub-plot in Carpe Noctem where Old Angel had to deal with Marcus's estranged adult daughter.  But, alas, the first cut of the show was EIGHT minutes too long!  And since David was soooo freakin' good and funny, you can't really cut out any of that out.  Therefore: "Bye-bye estranged adult daughter!  Maybe we'll see ya on the DVD someday!"<br><br>shadoed, Vanessa, DarkLady, Allyson & all others I may have missed: I really didn't come here trolling for praise, but thanks.  (I'm also not gonna turn any down...)<br><br>KAM:  If you want more Fred, then don't miss Monday's ep written by the unparalleled Mere Smith.  Even though it's titled "Fredless" I think you find it's got plenty of her in it.<br><br>

<dd>Wendy: Thanks for the support!  The musical just wrapped.  It’s gonna be AMAZING!!!<br><br>Chianne:  Hey, watch the fondling!  This is a family board (even though I’m on it).  But enough about me.  Where’d you get the cool name?  Tastes very Farscape.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  I will do my best to join Kitty and Candy.  Manwich needs love!<br><br>DeAN;): Drew’s all about the porn.  Speaking of New Boy, they start filming his ep Today.  Great script, great guy!<br><br>Jynx:  Love the pokes.  And Louis Armstrong, hey.  If any of you haven’t heard "When We Are Dancing (I Get Ideas)" then run out and find yourself a copy.  Soooooo romantic.<br><br>I now relinquish the board to Scott Murphy, Master of the Mystical Arts.<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Hey there Bronzers!  Long time no see!  I just wanted to stop in for a brief "hello" and to say thank you for all the nice things that have been said about my first Angel episode which aired earlier this week.  (Or at least the "slightly less hateful" things, compared to some of the feedback I've been reading on other sites.)  <br>(Oh, and Hey Steve!  How're things upstairs?)<br><br>

<dd>Jaiina:  Love writing for both the live-action and the animated show.  I get to flex different muscles.  In the animated show, there’s more emphasis on the Big Funny, which is, well, funny.<br><br>Selwyn29:  Piano is always good.  Trumpet too, especially if you blast out some Louis Armstrong.  Now what’s this I hear about hockey?<br><br>Newt:  The manwich thanks you.  Can never get enough of the good lovin’.<br><br>SlayerQueen:  Good to see you again too.  Wow!  Nice shoes.<br><br>Eiddy:  Big fan of Hawking.  Although I still don’t get his whole take on Sillystring Theory.  The entire universe created from spray cans of brightly-colored goo?  Come on!<br><br>Rikki:  Reading spoilers, are you?  Bad, Rikki, bad!  No musical for you!<br><br><br>Sadly, only one more round of  Poke the Writer, then I have to skedaddle to my meeting.<br><br>

<dd>Kudos to Vanessa and Dianne for spotting the quote from one of my favorite musicals, Jesus Christ Superstar.  I only wish the DVD included a restored print of the film and a couple of extra anythings.<br><br>Amberlynne:  Aww, so sweet.  I can't wait to see the final cut of the Halloween ep myself.  Here's a little non-spoiler spoiler for you guys.  Episodes 7, 8, 9 and 10 rock and rock hard.  You will be thrilled, delighted, and amazed, as am I.<br><br>Shadoed:  Big Steve can always use a cookie.  Mmmm...chocolicious!<br><br>DeAN;):  Yeah, I sent Candy and Kitty an e about appearing on the Succubus show after my Halloween ep.  It all depends on if I'm writing an ep at that time.  Hopefully, I'll be free to cause havoc across the airwaves.<br><br>ED1_faith:  No no no!  The pleasure is all mine.  I've been looking forward to posting with you for quite some time.  Ahh!  Sweet release!  ;)<br><br>Tiggytiggytiggysweettiggytiggy:  Always good to hear from you.  Yes, the speed of our e-mails truly do suck.  I'll wait by my computer, never to move until I hear from you again.<br><br>

<dd>Yo de ho ho ho.  A fine Pantsless Steve DeKnight Friday to you all.  This'll have to be a quickie today -- I've got to make with the meetings in about an hour.<br><br>What's the buzz, tell me what's a happening.<br><br>
