<dd><b>tralf</b>: your site, ya little chucklehead.  and way familiar with the Maternally-Influenced-Coiffure Issue.  when i did it, the convo went something like this:<br><br><b>me</b>: hey, mom! i cut off all my hair and dyed it blue!<br><br><b>mom</b>: (sound of Drano being poured into shot glass, downed)<br><br><br><b>eire</b>:<small> congratulations on earning a shorter nickname 'cause i'm lazy.</small>  well, gotta say that's the first time anyone's offered to paste my head -- in a non-threatening sense, anyway. combine that with a boobie compliment, and you've set me all a flutter!<br><br><b>kronos</b>: did. put it in a little glass box prepared just for the occasion.  pre-printed brass plaque: "The Pen I Nicked From <b>Kronos</b>/ PBP 2003".  i'm thinking of upping his meds.<br><br><b>littlexander</b>: probably won't be visiting the UK anytime soon.  can barely spell it to begin with.<br><br><b>Nikka</b>: thanks so much for working the auction and raising money for all those sick kids. you guys were really the stars of the evening, in my opinion.<br><br>okay, folks. must to be writing.<br><br><small>Ultimate Drew is a HOTTIE-BOOMBALOTTIE!</small><br>-mere-<br>sigJTT<br><br>
