L.Willow:  I'd be a Sequoia.<BR>
<BR>
chelsey:  hey!<BR>
<BR>
Delyn:  Joss and/or his staff read everything that we do.  The blood tears happened on the ghost roads, representing the shed blood of Jenny Calendar.  That may or may not mean that Angel could cry such tears in the real world.

<DD>HEY HANNA!  Do me a favor?  Tell whoever bagged you at school that I sent the following message:  Dear teacher/administrator:  The Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels contain no profanity, sex, or gratuitous violence.  As an educator, you should be happy that Hanna is reading something other than Cliff's notes.<BR>
<BR>
And let them know my web site so they can e-mail me if they want to argue about it.  That attitude pisses me off.

<BR>
In October, the very first BtVS Hardcover novel, IMMORTAL, which reunites Golden & Holder.  Well, I know I'M psyched.

<BR>
WinterRain:  hey!<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx:  Got the info.  Thought I replied.  Sorry if I missed it, my brain is fried.  (Look, I made a rhyme!)  Sadly, I won't be able to make it.<BR>
<BR>
Fiddileg:  When I was a kid, I read Doc Savage and Stephen King and Jack London and some nasty short story collections.  AND COMICS!!!  They were very important to my twisted development.

<DD>Delyn:  Sorry to leave you hanging, but as I said to Labrynth earlier today, that's why they call it a cliffhanger.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Gangfolles:  Nope. No French here, although Nancy has lived briefly in both Germany and Japan during her life.

<BR>
Li'lWillow:  Take your time, rocky.  Next month'll be the most important, and as long as we're prepared in the next couple of weeks, it'll be no sweat.  And thanks for the "Golden boy" plug.  : )</SMALL>

<DD>Fiddileg:  Thanks for the comments.  Just a note, though.  The Gatekeeper books, like Child of the Hunt and many of our upcoming Buffy books, are NOT FOR the Toddlers.<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen:  Thanks for noticing.  I hope the new series does well.  I'll probably do a lot of signings in New England/New York/New Jersey in August & Sept & Oct. but right now, the only one I have is going to be at a store called Jumpgate in Portsmouth, NH on May 15.

last post<BR>
<BR>
to whomever suggested I buy the "appalchian waltz" CD (sorry can't remember who!) - I got it and it's awesome.  Really, this bass player guy (can't remember his name - sensing a theme here) is a truly gifted musician and composer.  I like the soft pretty stuff best...<BR>
<BR>
carl - according to the most recent schedule wrap is April 9.  My work doesn't end until 3 weeks later tho.<BR>
<BR>
Ozman - don't get too excited cuz I have no clue.<BR>
<BR>

second-to-last post<BR>
<BR>
Missi - thanks.  Maybe the other thing you were gonna say was "skittles are good"?<BR>
<BR>
AjO - My bro has several CD's but they're not in stores.  He'll have a new one out in early 200 though and it will be available on the internet.  Re: Sid & Nancy - have you tried posting a wanted ad at rec.music.movies?<BR>
<BR>
BellaDonna, slay_me, Pam, NightOwl (study!) - thanks<BR>
<BR>
meeB - tell Leslie hi back.  And tell yourself hi too.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - please.  me no cook.  me order in.<BR>
<BR>
J.S.K. - You can download most of "The Wish" somewhere.  Somebody help me here - Sarah W?  And there are currently no definite plans for a score CD but eventually there will most likely be one.  We might have to wait a year or so...

Sorry bout the delay...  I had to go off and hang my head in shame for that misguided attempt at first.  Next time I'll just inform you ahead of time when I'm gonna try and you can just let me have it.  Though I appreciate FASTEDDIE's dedication.  It's almost like I did it myself!<BR>
<BR>
RSO's to Dirty Socks, Missi, CHRIS, Charity AKA<BR>
<BR>
NancyE - I don't read scripts.  They have offered to send them to me but they don't do me much good - I can get a much better idea of the pacing, performances, and look & feel of a show from a rough cut.   They send me a rough cut usually one or two days before the final cut.  This is when I get to see the eps for the first time.  Sometimes shots are missing, and (of course) music and SFX are temporary if they're there at all, but it gives me an idea.  Then, once there's a final cut, I sit down with Joss & co. and we watch the whole show, deciding specifically where music starts and ends and what it should do.  Thisis called "spotting".  Now comes the fun part: I wait until the last possible moment, doing everything BUT what I should be doing: writing the score.  Then I do a first draft of the score, Joss gives me notes, I make my revisions, and poof!  I'm done.  Typically most of the first draft (like, 95%) ends up in the final.<BR>
<BR>
Hey shishi, XG, weeping wil, delf.<BR>
<BR>
Becker, I think you asked me that one before... no, I haven't heard of him.  Is he L.A. bas<i></i>ed?<BR>
<BR>
Spike.w - My favorite ep is usually the one I'm working on.  <BR>
<BR>
Kyle - you're talking about "Amends", and thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W. - too late, I already not-ignored that "little" conversation you had w/ Melanie.

A first first on my first attempt?<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - my day is going fine.  Jane/wife left for Taiwan for three weeks yesterday, so I'm in that pre-wife-missage newfound freedon honeymoon phase... it usually only lasts a day or two though.  And no, you're not driving me crazy.  You'll know when you do cuz I start to really smell bad.<BR>
<BR>
Stakeme - I didn't write any music for the pilot, or for any of the first-season shows for that matter.<BR>
<BR>
RJ, FASTEDDIE - hey<BR>
<BR>
Willow- - dontcha know when I'm on you can post all you want.  THAT's the reason posters like VIP's so much.  No rules.<BR>
<BR>
Wolven - no, but there are a few of me floating around from the PBP.  I think Little Willow has one on her site.  I've seen a few others too.<BR>
<BR>
night Owl - I'm not procrastinating!  I just don't have much to do right about now... I spot "Earshot" tomorrow but I get 12 days to do it, so I won't be working for a while regardless!<BR>
<BR>
Ozman - <BR>
SPOILERS<BR>
.<BR>
.<BR>

I'm by no means the final word on this but I believe Buffy went to Angel after Willow told her to talk to him.  She and Angel figured out Faith was up to something and set the plan in motion.  Does that work for you?<BR>

Hey everybody.<BR>
<BR>
In the I-always-say-this-but-I-always-sincerely-mean-it department, "Earshot" as per usual is a good ep.<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - please e me, I got your package, and I have a question or two...<BR>
<BR>
"Enemies" had me totally fooled the first time I watched it.  Wasn't that fun?
