<b>Zeus</b> - - Can't come back.  I'm sorta personna Khambatta since Joss got the restraining order.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Blueronin</b> - - Please tell <b>Avarice</b> I appreciate the thoughts.  And, as for inventing the L.O.S.E.R.s acronym, that was actually more of a fluke than an invention.

<DD>I'm just testing an ancient code to see if it had an expiration date, and if I am who I think I am.  Ignore me.  <BR>
