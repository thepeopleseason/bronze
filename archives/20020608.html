<dd>Oblivia:  Pithy will only get you into trouble, believe me.  And I’m only half alive.  As for Spike – uhp!  You almost got me, you little minx.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  Don’t make me come over there.<br><br>Scourge:  It’s all clear to me now.<br><br>Freaking Amazing Witch:  I can tell you that love conquers all.  Vegetables are good for you.  And Tenacious D rocks.<br><br>CarpiDe:  Thanks.  I’ll try not to suck.  Well, at least not too hard.<br><br><br>Okay folks, sorry for the rush, but I gotta get back to the Angel script.  Stay frosty.<br><br><br>*poofity poof poof*<br><br>

<dd>Dallas Viewer:  Consider my heart warmed.  As for your suggestions, some of them are already being addressed.  Maybe.  If you’re nice.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  The core staff for Buffy is exactly the same, with the addition of another Drew (we call him Ultimate Drew).  <br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  The devil, uh, Disney deal is live action.  It’s a retelling of the Robin Hood legend with Maid Marian as the hero.  Hmm.  Wonder why they wanted me…<br><br>Django: Backlash?  Hmm.  Never had any.  What’s it like?<br><br>Brooklynrocks:  Nobody ever thinks their TV show is the best ever, and if they do they’re complete idiots.  We always strive to be better, and we always talk about brilliant shows and how we wish we had as much talent as those writers.<br><br>

<dd>Scourage:  Um, which monkey is that exactly?  There’ve been so many.<br><br>CarpeDi:  Nya-ha-ha!  No giggling.<br><br>Dudley:  Don’t force me to start lying already.  The season hasn’t even started.<br><br>Genevieve’s Lucie:  I was already working on Angel by that point, so I stopped watching Buffy.  Spike’s in Africa?<br><br>Kronos:  I’m sure they both deserved it.  The writing business is good.  Too good, actually.  I’m hoping the angry fans get the studios to boycott me soon so I can take a break.<br><br>Toni:  Funny stories?  Nah.  Saving them for my next radio appearance.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  I can honestly say that I am currently sans pants.  Fly and be free!<br><br>

<dd>Lealu:  Yeah, Angel's a great show.  I'm very excited to be a part of the team.<br><br>BlackMagickBitsy:  Any clichés you should avoid?  Yeah, don't kill the lesbian.  (Oh, I'm so going to pay for that.  When will I learn to keep my mouth shut and respond to all questions in a soothing, easily digested monotone void of the slightest hint of pesky humor?)<br><br>

<dd>Hola, fine friends.  I've neglected you for way too long.  Actually, I'm still neglecting you, since I can only stay for about a half hour before I gotta fly.  So, let me cram in as much as I can right off the bat.<br><br>Why haven't I been around?  Heck, I'll give you three guesses and the first two don't count.  Work work work and more work, of course.  I'm currently writing episode one of Angel and trying desperately not to ruin the show or accidentally kill any beloved characters (yet).  Along with this, I just landed a deal to write a feature for Disney, so as you can imagine my free time has shrunk to nothing.  <br><br>Before we dive in for a quick round of Tickle the Writer, I feel the need to respond to a post I read yesterday where someone called me a "giggling creep."  I take serious umbrage to that.  I do NOT giggle.  I pride myself on my deep, nefarious laugh and won't tolerate any slander against it.<br><br>
