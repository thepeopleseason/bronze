MichaelJ7770 - The kip-up is performed by placing both hands above the head palms down while on the ground.  Use the momentum generated by the upward thrusting of the legs and the push from the hands to lauch yourself up in an arch to a standing position.<BR>

Joss calls it "That flippy thing."  <BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Goodnight everybody.  Hope you like next week's episode.  It is directed by Joss.  So you know  that means it has some meaning with regards to the story arch of the buffyverse.  All his episodes  seem to give us some new insight.  So watch and see if Xander gets a gay dog or not.<BR>

<DD>I am sooo sleepy and hungry now.  I'm gonna trot off ... no skip .... no actually walk off to the kitchen and slam a spork into a side of meat.<BR>
<BR>
DAng!  Why didn't I have Faith go for the eyes with the spork and then have Buffy use the "Three Stooges eye gouge block?"  Now that would have been real spork fighting.  Dang it!  I always forget the Stooge methods work best.  That's why they are classics.<BR>
<BR>
Note to self:  Remember the Woo Woo hand wave distraction for next week's fight scene.

<DD>FYG - On ANGEL Alexis has another stunt double now.  The one that I used to use for him is now ... the stunt double for Mr. Marc Blucas.  <BR>
<BR>
In Young Frankenstein didn't the horses make a noise when you said, "Frau Blucas?"  Has Marc ever been to Transylvainia?  These are my thoughts right now.<BR>
<BR>
Goats btw, were once mentioned by Joss on the board.  So we sometimes rehash the meaning of this.  Over and over again.

<DD> Alexis - I was one of many who were thrilled to see that Wesley got to use his Rogue Demon Fighter skill tonight.  Way to throw that punk down.  I'm hoping that Wesley develops some super power.  Maybe something that allows him to command Goats to attack people or something original like that.  Wesley could have a wooden spoon mounted on a spring-loaded thingy that bursts forth from his chest whenever a vamp goes for a bite*.  Thus the surprise aspect. <BR>
<BR>
*Just a thought - an insane thought, of course.<BR>
Why walk around a glass door when you can just power right through it I say?

<DD>Brad Grenz - Stop it!  STop what you are doing right now.  Don't listen to him Amber.  He's the horned demon of trickery.  He only wants you to tell him secret Buffy info.  For the love of Joss don't do it or we'll all burn!<BR>
<BR>
On a lighter note: Brad, would you go for the fork or the knife?  Do you think Faith just got tired of knives and wanted Buffy to die a humorous death?  Or was that even a real fork?  Perhaps it was really some instrument placed there by Joss as a clue for us regarding Amber's future.  <BR>
Or maybe it was just easy to pick up.  It seemed to only have two prongs.  Doesn't that mean anything to you?  Think about it.  Two prongs.  730 to go.  Prongs ... Goats.... it all means something.  I just know it.

<DD>Amber's stunt double btw is Gloria O'Brien.  She is the same one who doubled the vamp "Sunday" in the first ep. this season.  I am hoping that things work out so that Amber gets into lots of Scooby-st<i></i>yle trouble so that I can abuse ... uh, I mean use Gloria even more.  I also hope that Xander gets a nice Great Dane that talks.  That would be groovy.

<DD>  I've known Eliza for <BR>
years and it was a pleasure to <BR>
work with her again.  She's soo <BR>
grown-up now.  I feel old.<BR>
I hope that no matter what <BR>
happens with Tara that you guys <BR>
will enjoy her nervousness and <BR>
awkwardness 'casue it sure is fun <BR>
to play.

<DD>devil - Sophia wasn't hurt by the French Door.  She was cut up pretty badly when she jumped through the first window (in the bedroom).  It took a few stitches to close the cuts up.  She alwasy cut and bruised though from head to toe.  I defy you to find any female character on TV that takes as much punishment as Buffy does.<BR>
<BR>
Karen Sheperd was bruised on the left side doing the stair fall and then on the right side doing the crash over the table.  She landed on one of the chairs on one take.<BR>
<BR>
btw - I didn't show any of that footage at the PBP though.  You may have confused it with other stair falls.  I only showed behind the scenes video of stunts that had already aired from season 3 & 4.  <BR>
<BR>
Lot's more to come though.<BR>
<BR>
*spork!*

<DD>  You guys don't even know <BR>
how hard the stunts are.  I think <BR>
Jeff and Sophia and my stunt <BR>
double Gloria should take a bow.  <BR>
And on meeting the scooby gang -- <BR>
I think Faith will bring the gang <BR>
closer together even though she'd <BR>
like to rip them apart..

<DD>  I think Joss wanted to <BR>
give tara a bit of mystery.  I <BR>
think willow, after the whole Oz <BR>
thing, needed something special <BR>
introduced into her life.  And no <BR>
prob about the ensemble.  it's <BR>
just a shirt win

<DD>miremba - I was just thinking that too.  Imagine a Sunnydale Cop who goes undercover as a Pizza Guy who opens doors for Slayers.  Every new episode would feature a very special "open door - get a#* kicked" moment.  A surprise musical guest could sometimes drop by to smash a vase over the head.  <BR>
<BR>
Amber - You are doing a great job on the show.  You've made Tara very sweet and I like the character.<BR>
<BR>
NOW --- RD will you get me a large thick crust with everything on it please?

<DD>well, I can't divulge too <BR>
much about tara 'cause Joss keeps <BR>

around and turns out to be nicer <BR>

<DD>LB - The French Door smash was the director's own idea.  We were walking through the set one day and he said, "Hmmm I'd love it if Faith could slam that on Buffy when she chases her in here.  Do you think Sophia could jump through it and keep fighting?"  I just smiled.  He sure loves to break stuff.  Although for some reason he made me change the knife that Faith was to pull from a drawer into a fork.  I don't know why.  Maybe he has a fear of being forked over?  *sorry*  He was a cook earlier in life.  Could be.<BR>
<BR>
No Sophia never got any apology and she never will.  That's how it is.

<DD>Strange One - Yes.  Sophia did the action with Karen Sheperd again.  I'm glad you liked the slide down the stairs.  At the time the director didn't really understand what that was about.  He had always pictured them rolling down the stairs, but I like to be different.  So I had them do it another way.  I don't like to do the same thing too often.  That's why I had Faith use a twist-to-the-side version of a neck break tonight.  We'd already done the "Jenny Calendar Special" to death. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everyone for the kind comments regarding the fight though.  <BR>
<BR>
btw- that was me playing the first cop that Faith pushed down.  I just wanted to stick my nose in there (ala' RD's Pizza Guy) since it was a special return of Faith episode.
