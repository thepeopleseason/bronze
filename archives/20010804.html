<dd>Thoin:  Xander will have a storyline this season.  One hint: wooden shoes.  That's all I'm saying.<br><br>Cashmere: Consider it my personal gift to you. <br><br>Karmix: Never touch the crack.  Messes too much with the shrooms.<br><br>Aphrodite:  If you find out who I am, let me know.  Been wondering about that for quite some time.<br><br>white wings:  Nope, lots more polishing to do on the Halloween ep.  And yes, much foreshadowing of things to come.<br><br><br>Uhp!  There's my dresser!  Gotta run.  I'll stop back in next week to spread around some more big Steve DeKnight love.  <br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Karmic:  Drew's favorite color is actually the absence of all visable light.  He tends to favor puppies and kittens for lunch. And of course gelato for dessert.<br><br>Old One:  Would love to do a Xander/Anya story.<br><br>Red Crayon:  Can never go wrong with a slice of pumpkin pie.  Mmm... pumpkin...<br><br>abt: Love to read the obituaries.  Like to make sure I haven't expired during the night.<br><br>

<dd>Red Crayon:  Joss has said that cross overs are still possible, but we're not planning any soon. <br><br>Angel E:  I believe I heard yesterday that season one dvds are coming out in the US later this year.  They had to delay them because of the show going into syndication on FX.<br><br>

<dd>@lex H:  Yeah, I should be doing commentary on my eps for season 5.  Not sure when they'll be out though.  The writers haven't done commentary for season 4 yet.  Nope, no cameo for me in the musical.  Sniff.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  I got enough big love for everybody.  Party at Steve's place!  Woo hoo!<br><br>

<dd>Lizza (the) Slayer:  Congrats!  Always good to get lucky on your birthday.  Now stop battin' those pretty lashes, woman!  I ain't sayin' nothin'!<br><br>biobabe:  Would love to see the short.  Send Tiggy an e to forward to me and I'll get back to you with an address.  If you send it to UPN, it'll take months to reach me.<br><br>Old One:  Would love to start with a Buffy comic, then branch out.  Hey, Mike -- need any help with Hellboy?<br><br>

<dd>TB:  Eh?  Speak up, I can't hear ya!  Wuvs right back at ya.<br><br>greeneyes: Can't really give out my email address 'cause of that misunderstanding with the FBI (my case comes up on Tuesday).  But if you e Tiggy or Boo at their DeKnight sites and ask real nice, they might forward your message to me.<br><br>Speaking of which:  Boo! Tiggy!  Big DeKnight love to you guys for being extra superfantastic.  Gotta do that lunch thing when you're in town for the PBP.<br><br>Red Crayon:  I steal all my ideas from comic books.  I have a great bit in the Halloween episode where Hot Stuff tries to break up Wendy and Casper.<br><br>Dirty Socks:  No no no -- thank you!  Hope you liked the script.  And hey, you got to see the tiny little things we cut for time, like Willow's nosebleed and the "underwear model" line.<br><br>

<dd>biobabe:  Been wondering where you got to.  Hey, any word on your movie yet?  Still anxiously awaiting a tape.<br><br>Karmic:  I see Drew all the time.  Hey!  Get away from my window, Greenberg!<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Just done with the first draft of the Halloween ep.  Now Joss and Marti will read it, and then I'll redo the whole thing just for laughs.  I come back up in the rotation again around episode 15.  Until then, I'll be doing some more work on the animated show.  I'm also talking to Dark Horse about doing some comic stuff.<br><br>Red Crayon:  I'll pass that along.  By the by, Fury has killer teeth.  That is one fine hunk o' man.<br><br>Mia:  Halloween ep went great.  Should be extra cool/creepy/sexy -- just like me!<br><br>

<dd>jaiina:  Thanks!  And trust me -- your English is much better than my French.<br><br>Red Crayon:  You know that's illegal in 48 states (lucky for me California's not one of them).<br><br>Old One: If only the made teeny hangers for boxer shorts.  Hmmm...<br><br>

<dd>abt and artie:  Thanks, folks.  Great to be here.  <br><br>greeneyes: Yes, I did the Succubus Club after "Spiral" aired in May.  Had a great time and will definitely go back next season, if they'll have me.<br><br>Sephiroth:  I'll try to post after I'm done here.  No promises, though -- extra busy these days.<br><br>
