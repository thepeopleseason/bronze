<b>AngelStarr:</b>  Thanks!  That's very cool...you'd better stop playing us, though, so they'll be forced to order some CDs!!! hehehe<BR>

<b>Kansas:</b>  Hi!  I hate to admit this, but I was stuck at my eveil day job last night, and was only able to catch snippets of both Buffy and Angel on the TV in the break room...very difficult to keep doing that and not get caught, you know?  hehehe<BR>
<BR>
OK, I am completely late!  See you guys later!  <b>And I hope to see all you LA types at the show this Friday night!!!</b><BR>
<BR>

<b>BuffyRileySlayTA:</b>  Hello, there...nice to "meet" you!  Well, no, we won't be playing at the PBP2001, as we haven't been approached about it yet, and we already did it twice, you know?  But I'm really hoping to attend!  (I sure hope I get invited!!!!)  =)<BR>
