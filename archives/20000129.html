<DD>And now I go.  So very tired.  Sorry for all unanswered questions.  Have good saturdays.<BR>

And off he rode on his majestic horse, a horse made of metal that had wheels and that he actually got INTO instead of riding on its back, a horse that was powered by gasoline and emmited a smoky plume of carbon monoxide as away he rode, shouting "giddyup!', and honking his horses horn.

<DD>Matrix, best movie, best screenplay.  Period.  Haven't got the storyboards, still not ready to look behind the magic.  Tony had to loop one scene in 11, and for some reason the loops did sound awkward.  Our sound guys are usually awesome, i guess that was a tough one.  Lady wolfsbane, your soul stuff is pretty near my own.  And I don't really understand the threaded board, sorry.

<DD>Okay, i'm winding down... But the answer is, barring unforseen developments, yes.  Buffy and Angel will crossover again this year.  And it will be quite different from the last time.  And yes, Angel will meet Riley.  I bet they'll be BEST FRIENDS..

<DD>By the by, destroying the citroen was a personal favor to Tony.  He hated driving that thing.

<DD>Spike fighting his way out of the initiative?  Funny you should ask.  This was one of the great foul ups in Buffy history.  When I saw the show cut together I went ballistic.  Spike was hitting everybody -- in the initiative, in the dorm hall, it was insane.  Now I surround myself with smart people (and then take credit for their efforts, a plan brilliant in its simplicity) but the ball got dropped there.  We couldn't reshoot most of it so we edited it so that all he did was throw people, not punch them, and when he did punch someone he went "Arrgh my head" and whatnot.  Mostly, we got away with it.  It's like every time I see Angel walking in what looks like sunlight, i just cry and realize I can't possibly run two shows.  But I press on after someone drags me drooling and muttering from the men's room and try to do my best.  So for the love of god, DON'T MENTION THE SPIKE THING!!!  Fa la la.

<DD>  I seldom drink, but the answer would be Jack Daniels.<BR>
<BR>
Slave, bingo.  But there is also another reason, which will be explained.<BR>
<BR>
Yes we will learn more about Angel's family.  We've got some juicy flashbacks coming up -- which can only mean one thing.  DARLA.  I've missed her so.

<DD>Sazzie -- you live in town?  Or a Wykemist?  I have been back but once, on my honeymoon.  Would have gone sooner but had no money.<BR>
<BR>
The stuff in the dream in graduation day does have meaning.  All will be revealed.<BR>
<BR>
HUSH was much the labor of love.  The whole crew worked their asses off and did wonderful jobs.  i was really proud of the whole effort.  No, i didn't read G I Joe.

<DD>See, this is why I love coming here.  You guys actually make me think about what I'm doing, about how I'm working this whole Buffy concepts.  It's an honor to be challenged by these incisive questions.  I feel compelled to answer more honestly than I normally would.  Yes, I like chicken a whole damn lot.

<DD>Lilly/Chantarelle -- I am hoping to bring her to Angel in a story soon.  Julia's a very cool actress.  Alien 4 -- afraid I don't share your good opinion of it.  I'll not write another movie I don't direct (and I don't think I'd do Alien because I'd like to work on a franchise that nine guys didn't have a piece of).

<DD>I tell the actors I'm gonna kill their characters all the time, and they NEVER LAUGH.  I just don't get it.  And yes, Tracey says "aboot."

<DD>Well, we meant it to be SUBTEXT, but you guys have obviously worked it out.  Yes, Willow is becoming a Monkey-owner.  I just hope we don't get a lot of protest from Christian Right Groups over this.<BR>
<BR>
Marginally more seriously, Willow and Tara's relationship is definitely romantic.  Thorny subject; the writers and I have had long topics about how to deal with the subject responibly, without writing a story that sounds like people spent a long time discussing how to deal with it responsibly.  To me it feels just right.  ALL the relationships on the show are sort of romantic (Hence the B Y O Subtext principle) and this feels like the natural next step for her.  I can only promise you two things for sure:  We're not going to do an ALLY or PARTY OF5 in which we promote the hell out of a same sex relationship for exploitation value that we take back by the end of the ep, and we will never have a very special Buffy where someone gets on a soapbox and... oh, I nodded off for a moment there.  I just know there's a sweet story there, that would become very complicated if Oz were to show up again.  Which he will.<BR>
<BR>
As will Faith.  I'm shooting an ep with the irrepressable Eliza now and it's great fun.  She's gonna shake things up.

<DD>Okay.  The lawsuit.  I agree that Xander has been slightly less in the foreground this season.  He's also been funnier than ever, great work nick, and look for his situation to change (slowly).  I personally dig him and Anya -- we're working on an ep that features them.  Neither Sarah nor Sophia has had a major head injury that I know of, though Sophia gets banged up pretty impressively.  I work on all the stories for Angel, but don't plan to write one by myself for now.  No time.

<DD>Well, you guys probably have all sorts of questions.  As is my tradition, I like answer a few right away to save time.  So:<BR>
1.  With riley, but not til season five.<BR>
2.  Long passages from "Hedda Gabler", translated into Urdu.<BR>
3.   Tony, by far.<BR>
4.   Because the WB just wouldn't let us show something like that even if it is a valid alternative lifest<i></i>yle choice.<BR>
5.  Yes, i made up the whole walrus thing by myself.  (I've still GOT IT!)<BR>
6.  I honestly don't know.<BR>
7.  All out war.  And it's gonna be fun.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  That should clear a lot of things up.  Meanwhile, i'm frittering away my day off by staring at the wall and going "I can't belive I have a day off".  Also by doing this.  How's everybody else?

<DD>That was a rather col<i></i>orless post, don't you think?  I liked the bit about the walrus, though.  Yep, I've still got it.
