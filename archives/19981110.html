<DD><b>Angle Man:</b>  Thanks.  You're always watching out for me, have you ever noticed that?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I've got to go.  So, hi and bye to all who've acknowledged me, and I'll see you again soon!<BR>
<BR>
Ciao!

<DD><b>Raven:</b>  Of course you may use our name.  Good luck on your promo!  And congratulations on your parents' gift!<BR>
<b>Little Willow:</b>  Cool.  Thanks.  =)<BR>
<b>Mabb:</b>  hehehe...cool!  (It <i>is</i> a pretty cool-looking sticker, isn't it?)<BR>

<DD>OK, I said "might I say" twice in that last post.  What a dork!<BR>
<b>SLaYeR:,</b>  Why, thank you!  (Did you recognize the dress?  tee-hee)<BR>
<b>Ali/Briolette:</b>  Um...I'm not even gonna go there.  But really, I think a TV in rehearsal would be very, VERY counterproductive, no matter what the justification.  (I'm not the type that can just have a show on in the background...I get <i>into</i> the thing, ya know?)<BR>
Hi there, <b>Lovely Poet!</b>

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hey!  Yeah, it was great.  And might I say, Giles is a hottie!  hehehe...  Oh, and snail mail received.  =)<BR>
<b>Vesper:</b>  Well, I think there's some confusion about what band I'm in. =)  See, Velvet Chain only appeared in one episode, NKABOTFD.  We did two songs.  "Strong" and "Treason."  I'd have to say "Treason" is my personal favorite, but "Strong" is more fun to sing.  (Especially the updated version on our CD)<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  Oui!  C'était très amusant.  Comment ça va ce soir?<BR>
Hi, <b>gazoo!</b><BR>
<b>Little Willow:</b>  Your idea for WAVs sounds great.  As always, might I say, you rock!

<DD><b>Ali/Briolette:</b>  LOL, no...unfortunately we have no way to see Buffy if we have rehearsal on a Tuesday night.  And our VCR's broken.  (But I think my Mom's getting me a new one for Christmas!!)<BR>
<b>Vesper:</b>  Well, thank you very much.  =)<BR>
<b>VT:</b>  Yep, we've been VERY busy...well, the "Buffy" song isn't even recorded yet...so I can't even hazard a guess as to its chances of being on our next CD.  Ans no, I haven't received a snail-mail from you yet.  When did you send it?<BR>
<b>Paris Angel:</b>  Well, that's why I sent you 2 of each kind, silly!  Stick one, and save one!

<DD>Wow... I just read the flurry of reaction to my 1st post... I had no idea I was gonna cause all that!  Thank you all for your comments -- I'm glad you liked the ep!  I'm going to Toddle off to bed now.  And, everyone, know that you're right to look forward to next week.  Doug Petrie wrote the next ep and it's a corker!  'night all! <BR>
Hmm... having a little trouble posting this, hope it doesn't show up three or four times!

Hi.  I wrote "Band Candy," and I just wanted you all to know how much I've enjoyed reading your comments!  This is fun!  And, by the way... Giles and Joyce definately did it.
