<DD><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Sadly, I had to work til 10pm last night, and did not tapw the show.  What are you talking about, though?!?  'Cause it sounds like a freakin' <i>hoot</i>!!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Xanderella:</b>  YAY!!!!!  Thanks!<BR>
<b>Little Willow</b>  Hi there, sweetie!  So sorry you have to work tomorrow.  That bites.  Grrrrrrrrrr...  Thanks for the VLD revamp-age!  You rock, as always.<BR>
<b>paksenarrion:</b>  Hello back...that is all, as well.  ;-)<BR>
<b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  LOL...I'm so glad you said that, 'cause that was EXACTLY the image in my mind when I typed depressurization.  Glad to see someone else is on my warped little wavelength....  ;-)

<DD><b>Thoin:</b>  Hi!  hehehe...nope, my neither my ears nor my occipital lobe were burning, but that's a nifty coinkydink anyway!  =)  I'm great, thanks for asking.  I'm very excited, 'cause my episode of the game show, <b>Win Ben Stein's Money"</b>, is supposed to air tomorrow night on Comedy Central at 7:30pm.  I'm having a little party and everything.  (Is say "supposed to" because they warned us when we did the show that <i>sometimes</i> Comedy Central screws up and doesn't air the shows when they've told you they were going to.  ACK!  So, keep a good thought for me that it really is my ep tomorrow!)  ;-)<BR>
<b>Beldin:</b>  Hey!  Nice to see you!  Vegas went GREAT!  It was such a blast.  I want to do that kind of gig all the time, man.  What a cool deal.  =)  And yay about the VCR-age.  ;-)<BR>
<b>singsinthecar:</b>  Hi, there!  What a nice thing to say.  =)  I really don't know if Velvet Chain will ever be on the show again, but there's always that chance.  (Keep those good thoughts coming, and you never know what might happen!)<BR>
<b>Old One:</b>  Hi!  Life's been treating me pretty well, thanks.  We just found out that <b>Sex in the City</b> is going to be licsensing one of our songs for an upcoming episode.  Yay!  How are you?
