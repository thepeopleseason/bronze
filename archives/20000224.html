Hi!  We have the <i>worst</i> timing.  I'm going to bed.  Blurry vision=not good.  Did you get a picture with me at the PBP??  I hope so.  If you did, send me a copy!  =)<BR>
<BR>
G'night!

<b>MichaelJ7770:</b>  Sure do!  Just send us a self-addressed stamped envelope, and I'll send you out a new one.  I don't autograph them anymore (don't usually have time), but if you include a note asking me to, I will, OK?<BR>
<b>nil8r:</b>  Probably the Bowie/NIN concert a few years ago.  (Unless you meant <i>our</i> concerts???)  I'm sleepy...forgive me if I'm being slow.  If you meant our concerts, I'd have to say playing outside, in Chicago, and having hundreds of people show up, 'cause they were following the sound of the music.<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight, everybody!  See you soon!<BR>

<DD><b>closeyoureyes:</b>  Well....thanks!  *blush*<BR>
<b>Miguel:</b>  Great big hugs back to you, and I'm so glad the pic came out well!  =)<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  I know!  Oh, well.  I <i>was</i> a little tense, mainly because I was worried about talking too loudly over the music and possibly making my voice too tired for the show.  I'm really glad I didn't come off tense, though!  =)  And thanks for the compliment!<BR>
<b>BUFFY SHERIDAN:</b>  Well, we just played the PBP, we have another gig this Saturday, and we're almost done with the new record!  YAY!!!!!!! <BR>
<b>~*~CLAIRE~*~</b>  Thanks!<BR>

<b>miremba:</b>  That would be Jeff Stacy.  I write about 30% of the music.  He writes 70% of the music and 100% of the lyrics.  =)<BR>
<b>Safarigirl:</b>  I'm so glad you like the show!  Yeah, that's a fun song.<BR>
<b>Tiamat:</b>  Lord, I don't know!  I wish I did.  I really want to come up there and play...  Maybe soon!  (We can hope, yes?)<BR>
<b>lurking b:</b>  Well, the day-job is OK, just tiring.  Speaking of which, I have to be up early in the morning, so I should go...
