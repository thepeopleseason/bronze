NuP: oy, we scouted so many, and heck i forgot the name.  but i'm pretty sure it was a methodist church.  i just like it the best, and was looking for just that crucifix.. cause i know Kelly Manners (our producer) would have laughed in my face if i told him i wanted Stuart to build one for me.

<DD>cosmic bob:  the church scene was my favorite, i really wanted to build more there with Angel IN a CHURCH... however,  it was a long and overbudget day, so i had to forgo some moments to finish the evening.<BR>
<BR>
LP: *blush*<BR>
<BR>
little willow: yep, i liked the picture too, only wish i had gotten that darned slowmo match shot to work.<BR>
<BR>
TB: thanks.<BR>
<BR>
lurking b.:  they yell alot.  And they pretty much run the set... it's a friggin nightmare of a job.  Ian Wolfe was my first AD and he was quite patient and helpful.... As was our DP, Herb Davis (who saved my arse).<BR>
