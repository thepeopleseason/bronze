<DD>Jasmen... JASMEN... whew.<BR>
<BR>
DeMorial (or DiMoreal)  Yes.  The Angel stunt double for the rain fight in the Mall with Buffy (who also played that Demon who had the fish bone weapons pop out of his arms) (RD you know the ep)  Oh Yeah... "The Prom"  that was the ep.  Anyway.  Chad Stahelsi is his name.  He doubles Keanu.  They are in Chicago or something right now on another movie.  He's going to go to Australia for a year to do two MATRIX sequels back-to-back.

<DD>Jasman:  How's this?<BR>
<BR>
lurking b. - Yeah.  I did the first Power Ranger Movie.  I did the Ooze fight, the flying creatures, the parachute landing, and the rollar blade scenes.  I also did the tv series.  We shot for a month on that one fight in a construction site in Sydney.<BR>
<BR>
Figaro - Thanks.  But I have to say that the editing was waaaay off on that episode.  Most of the action was on the floor and never got seen.  That won't happen again though.  I think that particular editor has moved on to do drama only now (no more action scenes for him)<BR>
<BR>
Sophia and I hated what happened to that episode, but don't worry.  Better stuff is on the way.

<DD>RD - Yeah.  Sophia is really dinged up with little knots all over from that last set.  You know the one you visited the other day.  It was a harsh environment for sure.<BR>
<BR>
btw - Congrates to you on the great directing work you did on the fight with Sophia on ANGEL.  She and the stunt guys appreciated the effort you made to get everything right.  Good Job!

<DD>Okay Jasman.  How 'bout this col<i></i>or.<BR>
<BR>
I did wear the blue Ranger spandex once.  I can only agree with Eiddileg.  Some of us should avoid it like the plague.  (Although it did look just right on Sophia)<BR>
<BR>
Zeus:  I'm glad you got a kick out of Guyver 2.  I was there helping for every fight and they wanted me to play the stunt Guyver as well, but I was doubling this new actor kid in another movie and the producers didn't want me to get hurt on a low budget flick while they had me on the payroll.  That movie was a trip though.  Non-Union and very hot as I recall.

<DD><vipyellow>Hey Zeus - That was my old assistant and the Asian stunt team that I belonged to that did Guyver: Dark Hero.  (They do Power Rangers now)  The Japanese producers wanted it to be similar to the cartoon.  (Actually it is a little like MATRIX too - only with stupid dialogue and rubber monster suits)<BR>
<BR>
<vipjade>Hey RD - you ANGEL producer type.  Happy Thanksgiving (please watch out for flying arrows)</SMALL>

Lady of Buffdom:  ouch.  suprised though to see that people still remember why we celebrate these holidays.  i was pretty sure it was to honor the virtue -- gluttony.
