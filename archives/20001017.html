<DD>greetings, y'all!<BR>
<BR>
i can't <i>tell</i> you guys how much today's postings have meant to me.  i went scrollin' back a ways, and to see all those good vibes -- let's just say, if i were capable of such things, i would cry.  no matter what the reaction to the episode is, my day has now offically been made.  and i thank you for it.<BR>
<BR>
who'da thought -- three years ago at this time, i was living Brooklyn, watching "Buffy" <small>admittedly RABIDLY</small> on a TV set that wasn't even mine, and coming in to work at 7 a.m. every day just so i could get in some quality posting time before the whup started.  how things have changed, huh?  now i'm living in Los Angeles, watching "Buffy" <small>admittedly RABIDLY</small> on a TV set that i <i>own</i> (and okay, so it was given to me for free, so there's no great up-from-the-bootstraps story there), and coming into work at... oh... around 10 a.m. or so.  if i feel like it.  <small>that was a joke, Mr. Greenwalt!  i swear!</small>  sometimes i feel like i fell asleep three years ago, a devout "Buffy" fan, and then... woke up, three years later, a devout "Buffy" fan who happens to write for "Angel". life, my dear friends, is nothing short of... really freaking weird.<BR>
<BR>
anyway, enough with the whole emoting-and-feigning-sincerity part.  bring on the male strippers!<BR>
<BR>
<small>um, you did order male strippers for my debut tonight, right?  you *did* think that far ahead, right?  right, guys?  right?</small><BR>
<BR>
and to <b>NancyE</b>: thank you for a most WONDROUS celebratory package! did you make this Angel yourself?  'cause he BOULDERS!,  and is now taking up permanent residence in my office, on my couch.  <small>and did i mention how much i love the "leather" pants?  rrrrrrr!</small> you are thoughtful, talented, and cuisinarily-gifted.  <small>u cee, i is an writer.</small> oh, and Shawn Ryan is a big fan of the chocolate chip cookies, i might add -- he even ruined his lunch with them! (uh, pretend, just for a moment, that "ruined" has no bad connotations.  'cause this one doesn't.)  thank you, thank you, thank you, dear lady, for making my debut night all the sweeter.<BR>
