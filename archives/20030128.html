<dd>Hi everyone.<br><br>Thanks for the comments on <br>Miracles!!<br><br>To those concerned, don't woryy, <br>Miracles won't go off into a <br>Touched By An Angel tangent!!<br><br>Wait until you see where the <br>story arc develops!! There's an <br>upcoming episode in particular <br>which takes you into the next <br>level. I don't know when that one <br>will air though.<br><br>THanks again for the <br>comments. It's great to read <br>reactions after having seen this <br>show way back in June of last <br>year!<br><br>
