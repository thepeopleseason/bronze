<DD>Before i go, i see we have a <BR>
newbie, so i'll try to explain <BR>
the show.  **** Van Dyke is a <BR>
doctor, but he SOLVES CRIMES!  <BR>
(I'm sorry, I just never get <BR>
tired of that crazy show...)  I <BR>
hope you all will jump in and <BR>
clue him up -- we need new <BR>
viewers!  Jamie Kellner is so <BR>
fond of saying the show has <BR>
peaked, audiencewise.  This <BR>
usually causes me to fire off <BR>
some witty rejoinder like "oh, <BR>
yeah?".  <BR>
<BR>
Bye all!  Think of me fondly, and <BR>
constantly.  (But don't stalk me <BR>
or anything.)  (seriously.  That <BR>
would be really weird.)<BR>
<BR>
Next episode will be interesting.  <BR>
Guarenteed.<BR>
<BR>
(no stalking)<BR>

places to see on TV, things to <BR>
watch people doing on TV.  Plus <BR>
exotic gourmet food to unfreeze, <BR>

<DD>Well, i finally got a look at the <BR>
posting board party pix, and I <BR>
look pretty damn good!  My <BR>
percing eyes, my alabaster <BR>
skin... my mousy brown hair <BR>
pulled in to a fetchingly loose <BR>
pony, my black leather jacket <BR>
setting off the curves of my -- <BR>
oh.  That was Emma.  Damn.<BR>
<BR>
Well, i look nice too.  You know <BR>
what they say, the camera adds <BR>
ten chins...<BR>
<BR>
And, longnameguy, I just read the <BR>
new TOP TEN today too and it's <BR>
stunning.  That is my favorite <BR>
book, even of all of Moore's.  <BR>
Just gets better.  "I'm no Uncle <BR>
Gojira!"  "You wouln't like me <BR>
when i'm naked".  Key stuff.<BR>

<DD>Okay.  that was just wrong.  i <BR>
know.  I love France, I love <BR>
french movies, french kissing, <BR>
french fries, paris when it <BR>
sizzles, wine, cheese, much more <BR>
wine... it's just that damn <BR>
resurrection film.  It gets me <BR>
down.  My apolgies to any french <BR>
type guys that are reading this.  <BR>
It's not your problem, it's MY <BR>
problem.<BR>

Down with Spain!<BR>

<DD>Slave, I just don't have time to <BR>
join clubs.  I JUST DON'T!  If I <BR>
join one... but i'm definitely <BR>
down with it.  Is there a site?  <BR>
Is there a link?  AS FOR THE <BR>
FRENCH, who are responsible for <BR>
certain films that shall remain <BR>
pointless, they are MAD.  But <BR>
the shows ARE designed to stand <BR>
alone -- after all, in <BR>
syndication they won't be <BR>
together anymore, so it isn't the <BR>
end of the world.  Or, sadly of <BR>
the french.<BR>

trepidation and also fear) to <BR>
click onto the links to the PBP <BR>
pix but I just sends me back to <BR>
the bronze.  Am I missing <BR>
something?<BR>

<DD>Jewel:  Yes, I was a machine <BR>
manufactured for the purpose of <BR>
relieving humans of their dancing <BR>
chores at the party.  Actually, i <BR>
wasn't much.  I'm afraid I just <BR>
didn't have it in me, and just <BR>
whn I made an effort, velvet <BR>
chain went into the free-jazz <BR>
bopfest that completely <BR>
confounded me.  Kai was <BR>
disappointed, but I won her back <BR>
by being charming and slim.<BR>

Does that make me like Buffy?  <BR>
Shadowsong:  I am working on an <BR>
ep where sort of anything goes, <BR>
though I doubt we can afford <BR>
walrusses.Mesuvius:  Yes, there <BR>
is an ep coming up with an amout <BR>
of nakedness, though of course it <BR>
is tasteful, boring nakedness as <BR>
opposed to the cool exploitive <BR>
kind they have on Cinemax.  <BR>

have been send with their endings <BR>
intact.  So at the end of this I <BR>
will type something inane.  No, I <BR>
mean MORE inane.<BR>

Georgie.  Don't blame Petrie.  He <BR>
was only following orders.  And I <BR>
promise you that while Faith is <BR>
in Buffy's body, NOTHING BAD WILL <BR>

<DD>Well as you can see I'm a bit <BR>
pale today.  I know they changed <BR>
the col<i></i>or code but but for the <BR>
life of me I can't remember what <BR>
it is.  This will no doubt cause <BR>
another riveting debate over <BR>
whether this is actually me.  Let <BR>
me clear that one up right away <BR>
by revealing a few facts ONLY I <BR>
COULD KNOW.<BR>
1)Willow is played by Allison <BR>
Hanigenn.<BR>
2)The vampires come out for the <BR>
blood and the girl stabs them.<BR>
3)I'm incredibly derivative.<BR>
<BR>
So there you have it.  Some <BR>
whimsical phrase involving goats <BR>
or walrusses wraps it all up <BR>
nicely.  i've proved i'm me.  Now <BR>
for the ACTUAL REASON I'm <BR>

I reach out to you, the fans, my <BR>
internet buddies, the faceless <BR>
(except for the ones with heads) <BR>
masses (oh, and the ones i've <BR>
met, who all had faces) who watch <BR>
the show every week and who are <BR>
therefore directly responsible <BR>
