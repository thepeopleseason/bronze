Hey Pixie, I just heard a better one, the end of Act 3 where Buffy gets knocked out, there's one of those evil piano whooshes that take us into black.  I'll still give you one nice 'n big on the next one though.  Just for you. <BR>
<BR>
Icelord - thanks.  (what silly post?)<BR>
<BR>
Hi DarkLady, Ladyjack.<BR>
<BR>
Angle man - no I was just being col<i></i>orful.  I've got 4 eps to go.<BR>
<BR>
Lovely Poet - Don't worry.  I may provide a temporary VIP fix but rest assured it will be all too ephemeral for the riff-raff and they'll be clamoring for SMG anytime now.<BR>
<BR>
spike_14 - my, how polite and patient you are.  I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite from this season.  "Helpless" comes to mind because I got to really stretch and try things I'd never done before, use all kinds of crazy 20-th century concert music techniques with strings and such.<BR>
<BR>
off to eat steak<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bye

second second-to-last post.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Kristen.  Angle rox.<BR>
<BR>
Pixie - Not stupid at all.  I sampled a bunch of inside-the-piano sounds and use them all over the place.  They may not sound quite like what you're expecting.  I'm trying to think of a place I used them, and I'm... just... not... quite... able to.  Generelly it's sort of this big eveil whoosh; I like to use it as a bridge between sections in the music, or going to a commercial when I need a big act-out.  Hmmm.  OK, listening to "Enemies" now.  Right as Faith spills the blood on Angel's shirt, there's a quick ramp up to the big percussion hit on the spillage.  This quick ramp up is actually the strings of a piano being scraped quickly with a guitar pick.  It might be hard to hear in the actual show, I dunno.<BR>
<BR>
I'll tell ya what.  I'll put it in nice 'n prominent in "Choices" then I'll come back and tell you where, and you can hear it.  Cool, no?<BR>
<BR>
PDR - I have no say in the non-Chris-Beck music they use in the show.  I tend to really like their choices though.<BR>
<BR>
DeMorayEel - Jonathan is mine, you can't have him.<BR>
<BR>
hi Waxy, it's good to see your enigmatic self.  Mystic doesn't ring a bell.  <small>Unless he's a percussionist.</small>  Did waxy like Becky's pitcher nice 'n goodie?<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - Most of my wife's projects I stay out of, usually because I'm just too busy, but also things can get tense when couples work together intensely for long periods of time.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Just Me, Simon, SpikeLVR<BR>
<BR>
Lan, hi, met her once, and no.

second-to-last post (happy Sarah W?)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Willow- - Don't worry.  I won't work too hard.  The motivation for everything I do in my life is pure, unadulterated, laziness. <BR>
<BR>
Sarah W., mélanie - you two go work it out amongst yourselves.  And Sarah W you can't always have green.  Yellow needs love too.<BR>
<BR>
Blackheart - that is correct, I will be scoring both shows next year.  At some point in the season the plan is to bring in a second composer for "Angel" so that I can have a life.<BR>
<BR>
Kare, the big and bold - thank *you*.<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - see my response to Willow- above.  No chance of that happening. <BR>
<BR>
loki - thanks, we'll see what Mirmax does with it in September, they might put it on two screens for a week and bury it...<BR>
<BR>
Corcus - ooh, you is slow :)<BR>
<BR>
Strawberries - You're way off, indeed.  The "opera" theme was nothing like "Cursed".  You are right about it being more haunting.  <BR>
<BR>
hey delf.

<DT><STRONG>Chris Beck (composer) who still would love to post in orange</STRONG> says:<br>
<SMALL>(Wed Apr  7 17:21:30 1999 209.179.213.106)</SMALL><br> 

<DD><BR>
Malista - Several reasons why "Dog Park" is exciting: 1) It's really good (OK, this could be the usual "beer goggles effect" where I tend to automatically love the projects I work on but still it's really good)  2) It's definitely getting a theatrical release (a lot of indie films I've scored never see the light of day) and 3) I'm getting a lot of money.  Well not really.  But sort of.<BR>
<BR>
Anais - I *have* seen that.  Quite good (if a little arty) if I remember correctly.  And Mark McKinney has a hilarious role as an animal psychologist in Dog Park.<BR>
<BR>
PDR - I do the orchestral stuff.  I do *most* of the guitar stuff without vocals.  If it has vocals it's definitely not me.  Well except wordless vocals like the end of "The Wish".  Oh, and the beginning of "Consequences".  This is getting confusing.<BR>
<BR>
Shaun - there is no score available for the main title music. I've seen guitar tabs floating around though.  Don't remember exactly where, you might try alt.tv.buffy-v-slayer.<BR>
<BR>
Keywe - Joey and I are still living a faux-bachelor existence.  Ends Saturday - see post below.<BR>
<BR>
ripley- wow, that sounds good - all the above, then.  :)</SMALL>

<DD><BR>
Hitomi - lol, I must say I'm quite surprised to be posting myself :)<BR>
<BR>
krypt - lol, if I have to be staked, well, there's my cameo, right?  And I *like* casios.  "Da da da" wouldn't exist without casios.<BR>
<BR>
Arymede - Crossworlds, huh?  My first movie ever.  Wait, maybe my second.  Glad you liked it.  <BR>
<BR>
JSK - yellow, yellow, not green... (on my screen anyway)<BR>
<BR>
Willow- the music goes fine, just finishing up a couple of last minute revisions on "Earshot" before frantically trying to finish "Choices" by Monday.  With Joss directing things have been rather hectic.<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen, I don't think I got your email.  Try again OK?  (durn Yahoo)<BR>
<BR>
Heynewbies, here I am!  I'm a famous VIP!  Come on, say something!  :)</SMALL>

Anais - I like Gabriel Yared too.  Never seen "The Lover".  Wait a sec.  maybe I have.  What's it about again?<BR>
<BR>
Uh-oh, chynna, you forgot your spoiler space.<BR>
<BR>
hi and bye FASTEDDIE.<BR>
<BR>
monique - she remains in Taiwan, she gets back on Sat.  She's good and bad - good cuz she gets to do all kinds of fun promotion for her CD (which was just released in Taiwan, she wrote and co-produced all the songs) including radio and TV talk shows.  Bad
cuz she has a herniated disc and it's getting bad.  She really doesn't want surgery so we'll just have to see.<BR>
<BR>
Hey everyone, don't blame me for the repeats, I could easily handle 30 episodes a season.  In fact I've already written the 8 extra scores, all I need is an episode to stick them in.<BR>
<BR>
My day has been singularly excellent.  I just got a gig scoring "Dog Park", a romantic comedy from Kid in the Hall Bruce McCulloch.  I am very excited about this one...

Why are there so many repeats?  When do the VIP's come on?
