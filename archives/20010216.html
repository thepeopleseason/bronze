<DD>Amberlynne - Uh, okay...<BR>
<BR>
How about "~mere's~ Stilletto Wielding Pyschos?"<BR>
<BR>
(I'm drowning here.)<BR>
<BR>
I'll come back when I'm more inspired.

<DD>Okay, I kno I'm stepping in it again, but let me try and explain...<BR>
<BR>
Angel and Buffy cannot be together because it's the sweet  torture of their doomed relationship that makes us care.  Desiring something forever out of reach makes their relationship epic... like Cathy and Heathcliffe (not the single chick and the cat from the comics).<BR>
<BR>
Romeo and Juliet would never have been a play if their love wasn't doomed.  If they lived happily ever after, all our longing for them to live happily ever after, to somehow beat fate, would evaporate and we'd all be left unsatisfied.  Well, me, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Spike and Buffy together, though... Boy that I'd like to see.  Those two should definitely fall in love and marry and have kids... Let's get it on.<BR>
<BR>
Such is the humble opinion of this much-maligned hack.  *sniff*<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(Okay, how long before this creates a big brawl at the Bronze, I ask you.)

<DD>Amberlynne - Of course I knew I could cause such trouble...  Why do you think I come on here from time to time?  To stir things up, make some controversy...<BR>
<BR>
It beats working. ;-)

<DD>mere-meisters?  WHat's that mean?  You're the masters of ~mere~?  No one can tame a savage spirit such as mere!  I scoff at the name.<BR>
<BR>
Besides, I didn't think of it.

<DD>Thanks, Safarigirl.<BR>
<BR>
justjo - I think you're talking about Doug P.'s episode.  But, thanks all the same.

<DD>Circe - Oh, yeah?  Well, that "No, YOU'RE a loon" thing was meant in the best possible way, too.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(I really have to come up with better retorts.)
