<dd>Tralf:  Oooh!  Amy!  Amy!  Amy!  I mean, ahem, whichever seems most rewarding to you as an artist.  But also, Amy.<br><br>@lex: I’ll tell you when I sit for one!!!<br><br>Cash: Lets just say they more than make up for it with the lemon-flavored Zingers.  And sometimes Twinkies.<br><br>Hey Drew: First of all, you have excellent taste in screen names.  I could NEVER pick a favorite to write for, that’s like choosing a favorite child, I love writing for ALL the characters.  And Amber and Emma are both sticking around, neither one is going anywhere, so don’t worry.<br><br>Hostile 17: Yeah, we’re all really excited about animated Buffy.  Yes, I am going to be doing some episodes of it, it’s gonna be really cool, once they finally pick a home... there are some interesting developments taking place right now, actually, we should know something really soon.  I’m looking forward to it, ‘cause I’ve had a blast working on the stuff  I’ve done so far for them, and I wanna do more.<br><br>MrsBig: It was the US version, first season.  And I’m glad you’re enjoying this season on Buffy – you clearly have excellent taste.<br><br>Net Slayerette: LOVED Office Space.  ESPECIALLY the flair.<br><br>Partyman: Hmmm?  Halfrek what?   Can’t hear you.  Speak up next time.<br><br>Molly: Mmmm... cookies.<br><br>Okay, my sweetie-pies, must skedaddle, please stay well.  Someone find out why I haven’t made Genre Magazine’s List of Men We Love AGAIN – I mean, yes, I know they’ve never heard of me, but I don’t see why such petty details should matter.  Love you all –<br><br>*poof-itty-poof-poof*<br><br>

<dd>SlayerQueen: Um, let’s just say that I finally get a chance to restore my lesbian karmic balance after what I did to Melanie and Lindsay in my episode of Queer as Folk...<br><br>Old One: Hey!  The season is winding down now, yes, they’re shooting Ep. 22 as we speak.  Er, type.  <br><br>Chris Marlowe: Awwww, you make me blush.  And also question your taste, because I think my voice is weird.  Books, books... I hope so.  My dream is to move into the Happy Fogey Television Writers Home and sit around writing books and beating the pants off DeKnight at shuffleboard.  Aw, hell, who am I kidding, he won’t be wearing any pants anyway... but I’ll still beat him.<br><br>Undeadenglish: Glad you liked it... I think there are lots more houses to destroy in Sunnydale.  The couples may change a bit, though.  I’m just saying, I think Spike and Xander could really make this thing work.  Really, thanks for the kind words, and I adore Clem, too, for what that’s worth.<br><br>Partyman: No, haven’t seen any of the parodies, but it sounds cool – except where you gave me a line... I don’t have to sing, do I?  Because, seriously... cruel and unusual.  I mean it.  I got laughed out of chorus when I was in seventh grade.  You understand what I’m saying... a room full of teenagers with cracking voices and awkward growth spurts laughed at my singing voice.  So, you know... beware...<br><br>Cash: See previous comments on spoilers.  Ibid.  Bad, Cash.  Bad.  But I am stern because I love, you know that.<br><br>Okay, one more round, my lovelies, then I have an oven full of Hot Pockets calling my name.<br><br>

<dd>Cash: What makes us tick is the 9-volt battery installed in each of us and three quarts of pure lemon juice every day.  I dunno, it’s kind of a case-by-case question.  I can see I’m wandering in in the middle of a rather intense debate here, and I have strong feelings on the subject of how much an audience should factor into an aritst’s work, but I could never presume to speak for the other writers on my show or any other.  I will say that personally, I do it because I have to, because if I couldn’t express myself through words, I would end up going even nuttier than I already am.  (If I wanted to make lots of money, I would have gone ahead with my original plan of making a career in the law, and if you listen very carefully, somewhere in Northern California my mother just let out a very hopeful sigh, poor thing.)  But not everyone is like me, and that’s okay, there are lots of good reasons to be an artist.  So sayeth I.  Now go forth and, like, be fruitful or something.<br><br>Tralf: No, I love technology.  I’ll love it even more when they finally get around to making that robot that follows you around dusting everything for you and that machine where you stand on the conveyer belt and raise your arms and then go behind a screen and end up dressed.  I mean, you know, get with the program, Scientific Community!  And where’s my silver jumpsuit??!  Um, wait, what was the question?<br><br>Kay: Ah, Riley and the missus.  Glad you enjoyed, Dougie will be so pleased, he did a great job there, didn’t he?  I mean, you know, I was sort of hoping Riley would end up with Spike, but I guess that’s a whole OTHER brand of fan fiction.<br><br>Dust’em: I’m waving back.  And waiving.  All kinds of rights going away, Miranda, 5th Amendment, privacy... no, wait.  Just waving.<br><br>Freaking Witch: Well, I’m kinda the wrong person to ask about spoilers.  Spoilers suck, kids.  They really do, I thought so when I was just a fan watching at home, and I think so now that I’m working on a show.  So, no spoiler confirmation for you!  Cool name, though.<br><br>

<dd>Tralf:  I just bought a new toothbrush (every seven years, whether I need one or not, ba-dum-dum), and it is green-and-white, replacing the very pretty purple one I just threw out.  And, no I didn’t hear I had Groupies-in-Waiting... golly, I’m flattered, if a bit, you know... disturbed.  And now I’m probably gonna get all conceited, insisting that the Buffy production office keep a fresh periwinkle terrycloth robe ready for me at all times, only certain brands of key lime pie yogurt within fifty feet of me, etc... yay!<br><br>ValMichael: Right now, I’m kinda working on nothing more exciting than my state quarter collection (who’s excited for the 2002 additions?  Anyone?  Anyone?) and moving to a new place this month, but we’re already starting to talk season seven, so that’s always kinda percolating in my head.  <br><br>Otis: I’m told Entropy airs the last week of April.  But who knows?  It’s more fun when you have to guess.  And I don’t know where this Willow-with-black-hair thing started.  She’s gonna SHAVE her hair.  You must have read it wrong.<br><br>@lex: Yeah OaFA is one of mine, hope you like it, I enjoyed writing it.  We’ve already shot a bit of material for the Season 6 DVD, I’m hoping we’ll get to do some commentary, too, keep your fingers crossed.  Mostly, I’m just excited because I got to try to pick Doug Petrie’s nose on camera.  Mama must be so proud.<br><br>

<dd>Hello, my sweeties.  Just wanted to pop in with a quick hello.  I felt the need to connect on a human level, and, no, I am not saying this just because the Survivor board is really busy right now.  Hope you all are doing well.  What's up in here, kids?<br><br>
