<DD>Sorry all, gotta go.  Wife just came home and now we've gotta watch the Practice that we taped last night.<BR>
<BR>
Dark Horse -- good to be you too, amigo.<BR>
<BR>
Weeping Willow -- If I wasn't meeting someone for dinner first, I'd come get you myself.  I swear.  I do hope you get a ride over there, though.  Maybe another Bronzer is going?  Try Polgara.  I don't think she is, but ya never know.  As for my site, it's www.christophergolden.com<BR>
I've got a whole list of the signings there.  And a lot of stores have copies of IMMORTAL already.<BR>
<BR>
Adios, folks.<BR>
<BR>
Chris

<DD>Weeping Willow:  Actually, I have signings all over MA and NH in the next two months.  In fact, this Thursday night at 7pm, I'll be at the B&N in Burlington, MA, that big new one.  I hope to see some Bronzers there.  If you can't make that, WW, check my site for a complete list.

<DD>FastEddie--You won't be disappointed.  Trust me, I've read the script.  It's everying "Buffy goes to college" should be.<BR>
<BR>
St. Germain -- thanks again.  And hey, the Bronze is the grapevine.  It isn't the first time I've turned to the PB for help.  You can always count on Bronzers.<BR>
<BR>
Carl -- Rosie, yes.  I doubt I can stay awake for Conan.  Getting old, I guess.
