<dd>Crap -- you know what?  I hate to do this to you guys, but I'm probably going to have to go. However, I know that you will all understand -- Joss is a' calling.<br><br> I'll make it up to you, I promise.  I'll come back later this week as soon as I have a chance.  We'll do a proper Minion address and some more Q & A and perhaps give each other backrubs.<br><br>Minions, I love you all.  I also love all the people who aren't Minions but say positive things about me anyway (but I love them less than my Minions.)  I also love the people who hate me, but more in a Christ-figure-you-gotta-say-you-love-everyone-way that's not really true.<br><br>Lotta love in this room.  <br><br>Be back soon, gang.<br><br>Goddard out.<br><br>

<dd>Oh man... again I get delayed screw all this magic up.  This must be irritating for you all...<br><br>This time it was Marc Alpert's fault.  He comes in with all these "questions" and "concerns."  Man, give it a rest, would you?<br><br>(Actually, in all honesty, Alpert is awesome.  He carries the show to the screen.  Don't tell him I said that, though.)<br><br>

<dd>Oops… sorry for the delay.  <br><br>Sweet God, there are a lot of posts tonight.  I ‘ll do my best to keep up.  I do keep getting lost in the scrolling murk.  Maybe I'll keep my answers shorter.  And funnier.  More poignant.  Heart-warming and erotic at the same time.<br><br>How come when I write the word a-s-s-l-e-s-s I’m censored but other people on the board get away with it?  That hardly seems fair.  <br><br>Okay, music questions – currently I’m obsessed – and I mean like stalker obsessed – with Queens of the Stone Age.  That band is jaw dropping.  Go buy all their albums.  Right now.  <br><br>Fun fact:  I wrote most of Selfless to Queens of the Stone Age.   And let’s see… Conversations was written to The Flaming Lips and the Vines and Never Leave Me was written almost exclusively to the live version of Iron Maiden’s “Fear of the Dark” (the Bruce Dickinson version.)  Music, very important to the writing process.  <br><br>Who else is good these days…  have you heard this band called Muse?  I think they’re pretty good.   And the lovely Tamara Becher just gave me a cd for a band called Sahara Hotnights and it’s damn good – girls and punk rock, I tell you what…<br><br>Oh, I’ve been listening to old Aerosmith a lot lately.  You know, that band actually used to be cool.  Rocks and Toys in the Attic – great albums.  Just try to forget about what comes later – you know, Affleck and animal crackers and asteroids… shudder.<br><br>

<dd>Man, the Bronze is jumping tonight.  God, I’ve missed you people.  Especially my Minions.  Minions, I thought about you all break.  Did you get my presents?  I hope they fit.<br><br>Lots of good questions.  I’ll see if I can do them justice.  <br><br>Dachelle, as always, we begin with you my lovely.  Drew Z. passed on your thanks, and believe me, you are more than welcome.  Love the new site.  Tralf really outdid herself.  I don’t deserve you guys.  <br><br>Wait, yes I do.  Who am I kidding?  I’m magnificent.<br><br>Eirefaerie, sassyeggs, amarra – don’t fight.  Please.   Here’s my solution:  you can all have me.  There’s more than enough Ultimate Drew to go around.<br><br>There.  Isn’t that better?  Yeah… mmmmmmm.<br><br>Nekkid Vamp Frog Dogmeat – okay, here’s your kiss…  Ha ha!  I gave you tongue anyway.  That’s my style.  Be careful what you wish for.<br><br>bubonicplague1348 – thank you for your kind words.  I love Spike as well.  Fret not.  He’s got some good stuff coming up.  And I swear to God, I would kill to be on the show in ******* chaps.  Could you guys start writing Joss and Marti letters?  The people deserve to be heard!<br><br>Karaph, eddy  – did Jordan really say that about B/A?  What’s your source?<br><br>Y_slaybelle – yep, it was a Six Feet Under spec that got me the job.  It was all about sex and death… and, you know, dead people coming back from the grave and talking to the main characters about their insecurities.   And then more sex.  Did I mention sex?<br><br>(That’s all actually true.  My advice to aspiring writers is this:  pack your scripts with sex.   Turns out people love sex.   Who knew?)<br><br>Okay – regarding questions about the PBP and surrounding events – I’m hoping I can go to as many events as possible.  I mean, c’mon, hanging with the fans is easily the best part of this job.  But realistically, February is right in the thick of it for us, and work may limit my schedule.  But damnit, I’m gonna do my best.  I love you people.<br><br>

<dd>Okay, here’s what I’ve learned from scrolling:  a lot of people don’t trust me to keep my word.  Which means we must be at about the sixth month mark of our relationship.  Pretty soon you're all going to be yelling at me for acting distant and focusing on work too much.  And also for playing video games instead having dinner with your sister and calling you by my old high school girlfriend's name when we're being "intimate" and thinking about Guns n' Roses when I was supposed to be listening to the dream you had last night.<br><br>C’mon gang, when have I let you down?  If I say I’ll be here, I’ll be here, unless sex or drugs or rock and roll somehow prevent me from keeping my word.  <br><br>So far, this is my favorite quote of the evening:  “We need to bring it up to Drew. I'm torn between watching JAG (I LOVE Dean Stockwell!) and the very small possibility of chatting w/Drew.”<br><br>Shadowquest, I’ll do my best to be more interesting than JAG, but I can’t promise anything.<br><br>I wish this was Thursday.  Isn’t that the day where everyone talks about what music they’re listening to?  Can we pretend it’s that day?  What have you guys heard that's any good?<br><br>Now I have to scroll and read the stuff that was posted while I was scrolling...<br><br>

<dd>Hello you magnificent ********.  Sorry I'm a little late.  I blame David Fury.<br><br>How is everybody?  What's going on?  Guess I better scroll...<br><br>
