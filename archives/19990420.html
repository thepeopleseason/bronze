Oki - wow, that hadn't even occured to me. Indeed the ep features a kid with a large gun whose intent seems to be to shoot the place up.  Now that I think about it...  I guess we'll have to see what people's mood is at the beginning of next week, but, man, it would be kind of insensitive for the WB to air it so soon.<BR>
<BR>
It will be interesting to see how it plays out.</small><BR>

<DD>Sorry to run off... need to go watch NYPD Blue.<BR>
<BR>
Adina - I spend anywhere from three (if it's a light show and I'm feeling frisky) to six days working on an episode.  Usually four or five.  It leaves enough time for either a life or one other project.  Currently that's the latter - "Dog Park", a romantic comedy.<BR>
<BR>
kugel - thanks, I haven't heard "Pushing Tin" but I usually like Anne Dudley's work... Still, I'll take the cimpliments where's I can get em.<BR>

<DD>Hey fax1.  Chile good I assume.<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer - I'm 29.  I turn 30 soon.  And I'm doing very well thank you.<BR>
<BR>
Adina - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
horizon - Don't wear out your hard drive K?  I haven't started the finale.  Just finishing up "The Prom".  Bring the kleenex for that one.

<DD>Icelord, Shadowslayer - thanx<BR>
<BR>
Jeannie TTF - She sings on my score for "Guinevere" too - not formally trained but with a little digital maniplulatory help the innocent and sweet quality of her voice really comes through.<BR>
<BR>
Thy Slayer - bambi eyes ain't gettin you nowhere.  Besides which we haven't really made much progress on the theme in the last few weeks... it's been rather busy.  It's still very much in the embryonic stage.<BR>
<BR>
Oki - lots of thoughts... now's not a good time for me to get too into it though.

<DD>OK, I really must be going...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Ollie:</b>  Nope.  The Buffy Soundtrack is not out in America yet.  It should be out by June.  Velvet Chain, however, does not seem to be one of the bands on it.  =(  So, you'd better order a CD from us if you ever want to hear our music!  lol<BR>
<b>Green Falcon:</b>  Have not sold it yet, why?  you mean our OLD comupter, right?  not the iMac.  That one we did sell.  And an E.P. is just a shorter CD.  Ours is 6 songs long.  It's a holdover expression from the days of vinyl, meaning Extended Paly.  (In between a 45 and an LP, or Long Playing record.)  Get it?<BR>
RSOs to <4Paws and Liddie!</b><BR>
<b>DingoBaby:</b>  Well, my oh my, how you rock!  =)  And I guess you're right about it being a statistical improbabliity, but I've always been one-in-a-million!  lol<BR>
<b>Vaedus:</b>  Yep, that was my sarcastic typing.  Glad it came through!  And yes!  Forego the beer and get the Joss-darn CD's, OK?<BR>
<BR>
Leaving...

<DD><b>Jimbo:</b>  Thanks!  And cool!  Someone is sending me a copy of it, I believe, so I'll be sure to check out your drawing!<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  Yes!  I did receive them, but I forgot to give that one to Elizabeth Anne the last time I saw her, but I promise she'll get it sometime this week.  =)<BR>
<b>Icelord:</b>  Oh!  Well that's great, but Imeant did you write your letter to TVT Records complaining that Velvet Chain isn't on the Buffy Soundtrack, and telling them that they better change their minds!!!  hehehe<BR>
<b>Asanti:</b>  Hi!  Nope.  No iMac.  Bought it, still paying for it (AppleLoan), but had to sell it and get a PC.  Nightmare.  All Jeff's fault.  lol<BR>
<b>Ollie:</b>  would love to, but we don;t have the power to release anything in England.  We don't have a label.  But you can always order any of our CD's from our website!  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<b>Jasmine:</b>  Hello!  Well, sure...but I need to go SOON.<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  Too far.  But maybe!<BR>
<b>keylime:</b>  Ah, yes.  Misery does love company, no?

<DD>I want to see her name properly:  Elizabeth Anne.  There.<BR>
<BR>
<b>DingoBaby:</b>  Thanks!  Glad you like it.  the next one should be out by late summer.  Do you have "Warm" yet?<BR>
<BR>
<b>SarahNicole:</b>  Hopefully, we'll get some investor or a label deal or <i>something</i> that will enable us to tour again.  If and when that happens, we'll definitely hit your neck of the woods!  (Of course, if we got on the Buffy Soundtrack, then all that other good stuff might fhollow.  *sigh*)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Vaedus:</b>  Hey!  Yes, actually, I came specifically looking for you!  Of course!  Why else would I be here????<BR>
<BR>
<b>DavidFan:</b>  Thanks!  That sounds very very cool.  Way to take the initiative!  And yes, I will require front-row seats for every performance...

<BR>
<b>IceLord:</b>  Wow!  Thanks for the protection!  I'm fine, thanks.  Did you write you letter like a good girl?  lol  j/k   But did you???  ;-)<BR>

<DD><b>keylime:</b>  lol...I know.  What a coinkydink!  I'm doing pretty well, thank you.  The weather here has been insane, though.  It was raining and about 55 degrees all last week, and now it's sunny and 90!  Um...can we have a Spring, please???<BR>

<b>Basia:</b>  Howdy!<BR>
<b>DingoBaby:</b>  Hehe...I've wondered about that sometimes...I wasn't sure if they leave that customs thingie on or not.  Well, there ya go!  You'd better frame that puppy!  lol<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  Everything's cool, thanks.  The more letters we get going, the better!  How far North?  We sometimes get up to San Francisco...<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  you ROCK.  And yes, I think I did get it...but I've just been swamped lately.  Sorry if I haven't responded in a timely fashion...
