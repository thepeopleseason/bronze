<dd>Bonjour!  This is my only post tonight because I have to go to bed 'cause I have a 6 am call.  'nough said on that front.  I am posting tonight 'cause I wanted everyone to know that I have enjoyed the bronze enormously over the past two years.  It's been so neat to lurk about and see what people are thinking.  Even though I don't post very often anymore, I still like to keep abreast of what is going on in the Buffyverse.  I also wanted to say that it would be splendiforously cool if UPN created a linear board at the bronze so that we can all chat more easily. Threaded is nice, but it's a little harder to navigate.  And people are always starting weird threads that boggle the mind like: 17/swf looking for Riley and Dead vampire spikey are you THERE!!!!!!!!!! <br><br>Anyway, that kinda stuff is cute and all, but it would be nice just to be able to chat normally again.<br><br>alright, must get some sleep.  tara love to all.  kitty fantastico sings her love<br>amber<br><br>
