ok one more<BR>
<BR>
Circe - I'm going on a three-week African Safari.  How bout that for plans?  Joss is  shooting ep 22 ("Restless", actually) now.  Too early to say for sure but I hear great things, particularly from the scoring standpoint.<BR>
<BR>
Angelnbuffy - thanks I'm quite proud of that one too.<BR>
<BR>
clarrie - that's quite a tradition - but shouldn't we date for wahile first?<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen - e me and I'll see what I can do.

last post<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob - coming soon coming soon coming soon really<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen - I am, and shall be for some time, completely slammed with work.  This summer looks good though  :)<BR>
<BR>
Polgara - I too have decided never to give birth.  (Convenient huh)<BR>
<BR>
Prospero - I also score "The Practice".  Next week's ep features 30 minutes with no dialog - the judge issues a gag order and all the lawyers have to use sign language.  Or maybe that's just wishful thinking...<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo - I don't start writing until I get a final locked cut - the music is very tightly timed to picture and it's counterproductive to start while they're still editing (though it's been known to happen, esp. in feature films).  And yes I need to write extremely fast sometimes.  It's just something I've learned to do.  It essentially involves lowering my standards to match the quality of my ideas.  :)<BR>
<BR>
exhile - I was just being impressed.<BR>
<BR>
BuBBle - that was the best grin & wave I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot.<BR>
<BR>
FSM CDMan - Didya hear I was just in the studio with some friends of yours?  (shhhh)<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - It would be premature to think too hard about this, but one of the decisions facing me soon (very soon I promise) will be whether to a) include only season 2 and 3 material, and hope there will be a volume 2, or b) put season 4 material on there as well at the expense of some oft-requested clips from seasons 2 and 3.  Ahh it's so hard to be me.<BR>
<BR>
And with that I'm outie.<BR>
<BR>
- Chris

loopless tourogal - TYG = This Year's Girl.  jane = preg.  Anything else?  :)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and Hi to andyourlittledogtoo and Elusio and phillygirl.<BR>
<BR>
Eiddileg - Do klezmer bands have xylos?<BR>
<BR>
lisa1 - My dog Joey hums melodies to me as I sleep.  As for the rest of it, I just go with my gut.  The musical choices are generally obvious (big drums and lots of fast stuff for a fight scene, pretty melody for a romantic scene) and when they're not I just wing it (with help from Joss of course).  As for my working process... mess around until it sounds cool, move on.<BR>
<BR>
angelnbuffy - "Hush".  It took a while to get used to the lack of dialog - I (and many of my colleagues) am very preconditioned to tone it down when characters are speaking - otherwise the music fights with the dialog.  When I first started writing I found myself creating all this room in the score for the characters' mouthing, then realizing the space didn't need to be there and rewriting.  Plus, there was just so much featured music.  Your average Buffy cue (by necessity) is normally not very interesting or dense, otherwise it would draw attention to itself in the scene.  "Hush" was twenty minutes of the opposite kind - the cues were just full of notes and counterpoint and went ON and ON.  But I wouldn't have traded it with an episode of, say, Law & Order, which contains, on average, three minutes of extremely simple (and effective, I might add) scoring.  Opportunities like "Hush" are rare for composers in TV, and I'm forever grateful to Joss for giving it to me.<BR>
<BR>
Slayed Soul - I do the music for Buffy only.  Robert Kral does Angel.<BR>
<BR>
For AjO and anyones else interesated in my brother's music.  Click <a target='_blank' href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004R8PH/o/qid=955640739/sr=8-4/ref=aps_sr_pm_2_1/002-7134438-9883411">here</a> to pick up a copy of his CD.<BR>
<BR>
Please let that have worked.

MeeB - Don't wanna spoil you, except to say... you can expect a little pain, yes.<BR>
<BR>
Eire - Yes, I scored "Bone Daddy", a rather entertaining if gruesome serial killer romp.  And if you see my name anywhere chances are it's for music.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Anna.  Glad to be your first.<BR>
<BR>
Lorna - Oh I think definitely mcleany.  Totally gay and arseless.<BR>
<BR>
valMichael - Joss is shooting 22 now.  My part comes at the very end (sometimes mere days before air), so don't worry.  And from what I hear about 22 it's a keeper.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Legal Lurker and Amish Boy - I could please the both of you with a klezmer band, couldn't I?<BR>
<BR>
Carita - how about a fruit basket?<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - I said more, not better.  :)<BR>
<BR>
exhile - oooh you said non-diagetic.

KAT, Carita, Polgara - Thanks for asking, Jane is doing great.  Her tummy is getting quite round by now.  Carita, July is fine for flying (she's not due till October) but don't get your hopes up for seeing her at the T.O. PBP - she'll be in no mood to get on a plane I'm sure.  As for me, well...<BR>
<BR>
Hi to Antipodean (which means?) and Juggernaut.<BR>
<BR>
Darkness, exhile - I do all the instrumental music for Buffy (with a few exceptions, like the Buffy/Riley fight/sex bit from... oh what was it... all those episodes between Hush and TYG tend to blur together...).  I compose it all by my lonely self.  Angel's scoring is handled (quite ably) by a very nice Australian fellow named Robert Kral.

Thanks for the links everyone.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks also to DarkLady for the suckage (hehe I originally spelled it DrakLady).<BR>
<BR>
Carita - SMarties = gone (but it took long enough)<BR>
<BR>
MeeB- 19 does not have as much music as GD2.  And the "Hush" comparison is unfair too, since the music in "Hush" was featured prominently so much of the time.  But it's still a lot dammit!  (oh and you win for giving me the exact right link - thanks)</SMALL>

Good morning.<BR>
<BR>
Almost done with ep 19, which has more minutes of music than "Hush".<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone know a site which lists the air dates of all Buffy eps this season?  Including repeats and non-Tuesday airings?
