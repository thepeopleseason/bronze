<DD>Reading that post about Chris's signing...if anyone is in San Diego this Saturday, I will be signing at noon at Mysterious Galaxy's gala birthday party.  It's on Convoy Street in Kearny Mesa.  Come and support the most wonderful independent bookstore!  I'll be there and they are making a space for Chris so that we can channel his spirit to sit beside me. You will LOVE this store.

<DD>Gotta . . . book.  Two novel deadlines this month, and then I turn to short stories for a couple weeks.  Chris is editing an anthology of stories bas<i></i>ed on the comic book, Hellboy, and my outline was approved by the series creator.  I'm really looking forward to that project.

<DD>Again, thank you for the praise and compliments.  You don't know what it means, coming from our fellow Buffy devotees.

<DD>I definitely need to come in here more often <G>.  Working on a science fiction novel tonight, of all things and wishing it had something to do with...Buffy!  It's the last book in a trilogy as well.  Chris and I are trilogy kids.  I hope some Bronzers have had a chance to read his vampire trilogy, The Shadow Saga.  It is truly revolutionary.  I adored it.  Of Saints and Shadows; Angel Hearts and Devi Souls; Of Masques and Martyrs.  Fabulous.

<DD>Thanks Sarah and Charity.  I so owe Little Willow some correspondence.  Also, Overbite.  Are you in here?  I have been trying to come up with a proper thank you and instead have fallen into the black hole of shame...it is stunning.  You are WONDERFUL!

<DD>It's very neat for us that the entire trilogy is out.  Looks very nice when it's stacked together.
