<dd>Just when I think I’m out…<br><br>LJ:  14 Below?  That’s in my hood.  I’ll email you, then you can send one back to me.<br><br><br>Really gone now.  If you haven't already, run out and buy yourself the Iron Monkey DVD.  Best kung-fu film ever.<br><br>*poof, dammit, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Lilyana:  Hey sweetness.  Things are groovy on this side of the world.<br><br>Willow 1231:  You will sleep now and when you awake will be an official Steve DeKnight groupie.  Dance, groupie, dance!<br><br>Dallas Viewer:  I know a lot of fans have commented on the Buffy/Spike inconsistencies, but for me they really don’t exist.  Buffy’s feelings for Spike have been plotted specifically to be all over the map.  She’s back from the dead, she’s hurting, she’s confused.  Not just about Spike, but about everything.  Maybe those glasses will help clear things up.<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Petrie has a fear of anything electronic.  I once saw him try to claw the pacemaker out of a Fox exec.   So the chance of him posting is somewhere between slim and Buffy being happy.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  Send me an e.  <br><br>Rack:  We have plans for Dawn.  Hee hee hee.<br><br>Stellasurya:  My plans for hiatus are distinctly insectoid.  I should be working on a Firefly script.  What can I tell you?  It’s not like any sci-fi show you’ve ever seen.  Honest.  <br><br>The Partyman:  Beats me when the episodes air.  Someone from production pokes me with a stick whenever a new one’s coming up.<br><br>Okay, gotta fly.  Those balls aren’t going to rack themselves (sorry Rack).<br><br>Stay cool, stay real, and stay spoiler-free.<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Princess of Darkness:  Steve always needs new groupies.  <br><br>Rack:  Thanks.  It’s nice to know I managed to sneak in a good one.  So does that mean I can do a couple of bad episodes now?  How much time do I have before I have to cough up another good one?  ‘Cause that’s, like, work.<br><br>White Wings:  Yup.  All done with the cough.  Would be completely back to normal now, but I made the mistake of mixing tequila with my antibiotics.  Bleeech!  Kids, don’t try that at home (unless you want to see your skeleton swimming in the pretty blue water).<br><br>The Partyman:  Haven’t seen Crossroads, but I’m hoping for a special edition DVD.  <br><br>Stake:  That explains why I can’t play the guitar!  I sold my soul to get this here sweet writing gig.  Dude!<br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Who knows?  Maybe you’ll see us jam at the next PBP.<br><br>Dallas Viewer:  Yeah, we have great people working on the show.  And another hats off to the amazing Lisa Lassek who edited the hell out of Dead Things.  Sadly, she’s no longer working on Buffy.  Big Joss pulled her off to edit on Firefly.  She’s putting together the pilot as we speak – and man does it rock.<br><br>Kiba Rika:  I run to the mail every day hoping my hat has finally arrived.  Sigh.<br><br><br>Okay, one more round and then I'm off to play pool with Mere.  Sucker!<br><br>

<dd>Dallas Viewer:  Buffy sure has been rough on Spike.  But she recognizes that, and knows deep down it’s wrong.  This is particularly evident in the final scene of Dead Things.  On the other hand, Spike is a complicated character.  He’s trying to be good, but man does it go against his nature as a vamp.  Personally, I’m rooting for these crazy kids to work things out.<br><br>Miller’s angel:  Yeah, I was a bit surprised by all the fuss over Marti’s interview.  I read it, but didn’t see why everyone was so upset.  What was the dealio?<br><br>Princess of Darkness!:  Finally we meet again.  Hey, I’ve been meaning to email you – who was the ring for, Sarah or Michelle?  I completely forgot.<br><br>Malum_Forma:  Of course I remember.  And good for you for being spoiler free.  You’ll live longer, trust me.  As for Dead Things, It wasn’t Katrina in the woods interacting with Buffy – it was Jonathan in the glamour.  Katrina’s body was planted at the bottom of the embankment.  Buffy knocked Glamour Jonathan down the side, then he scuttled away to hide.  In the script, he has a big bruise on his face when he de-glamours in the van, but it’s hard to see on screen because it’s so dark.<br><br>Dudley:  Thanks, we do our best here at Buffy Central.  And comparing us to MASH is high praise indeed.  I’m all a-glow.<br><br>Willow 1231:  Getting your name right smacks dangerously close to math.  Don’t make me get out my slide rule.<br><br>

<dd>Grrr!  Argghh!  Back from the dead, Zombie Steve prpares to face the sweet, sweet music of neglect.<br>Let's dive right in:  <br><br>Stake:  Thanks.  And as always, hats off to big Jim Cotner for directing the hell out of Dead Things.<br><br>Frodo:  Yes, Buffy will regain her focus.  Episode 22 centers around a trip to the ophthalmologist where Buffy will be fitted with a hip pair of corrective lenses.<br><br>Willow1213/Tralfamdore2001:  Doug and I jam occasionally with James in his trailer.  Doug lays down the sweet funky bass, and I come in with the smooth lead.  Oh, did I mention we totally suck?  James is brilliant, but Doug and I are musically challenged, to say the least.<br><br>

<dd>RSO'd to all!<br><br><b>tralfamadore2001:</b>  It's purple.  =)<br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  IT was a world-premiere musical called "Knight Life."  They put it up for the very first time for three weeks in Santa Barbara, and now they're hoping to take it to LA and then hopefully, eventually NY.  I got involved by auditioning for it!  =)  I had a great time, made some money and haven't had to go back to my old day job for 5 months now.  (yay!)<br><b>BBS:</b>  *blush*  Thank you!  Well, I'm hoping to do some more theater, but for sure Velvet Chain is playing at CreepCon in Baltimore June 7-9, and we'll be gigging here in LA in late May.<br><br>
