<DD><b>amberlynne:</b>  Well, thanks very much!  I like "Moody Groove Music" <i>quite</i> a bit (it's a studio album), but our very latest, "Velvet Chain Live at the Temple Bar," (obviously a live album) has the advantage of being an Enhanced CD, with a 20-minute Quicktime video of the concert that was recorded for the CD.  Either one would be a great choice.  Although I love "Warm" And the "Buffy EP," too!  LOL  It's like having to choose between your kids or something!  LOL<BR>
<b>Thoin:</b>  We were in Adare, in Co. Limerick.  It was <b>beautiful!</b>

<DD>Sorry about the double-post...my computer's being a bit wonky.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I should go...I have dinner plans.  (Sushi!  Yum!)  Just a side-note, though, before I leave:  I'm going to be a contestant on the game show "Win Ben Stein's Money," and I'm shooting it on Thursday!  I'm a bit nervous, as I don't have cable, and haven't even <i>seen</i> the show in over 2 years, (it airs on Comedy Central), so I'm sure to be the least-prepared person there!  LOL  Anyway, keep a good thought for me, OK?  I don't want to make an ass of myself!  ;-)

<DD><aqua1265><b>Laz:</b>  Well, it was actually <i>snowing</i> when we got there, which it almost never does.  They don't have snow plows or anythiing, so the roads were a disaster!  lol  But it cleared away and melted by the 3rd day we were there.  The rest of the time, it was typical Irish weather...at least one rain shower per day!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Amberlynne:</b>  Hi!  <i>*wave*</i><BR>
<b>ED1_Faith:</b>  I'm 99.9% sure we're not playing at the PBP this year, but I do hope to attend, and we're trying to work out a gig that weekend so people can come see us if they want to.<BR>
<b>Cathedral:</b>  Hello...I am, a little.  ;-)<BR>
<b>TaraAnyaKate4eva:</b>  Hi, there!  I hope you get it!  If you tell whoever gets it for you (your mom or something) to e-mail me, I'll autograph it for you for your Bday!  =)<BR>
<b>Irene Adler:</b>  Bummer.  I feel for you.  ;-)  I'm well, thanks.

<DD>Good evening, all!  I can't stay on long, but I wanted to say hey and Happy New Year and stuff!  I was in Ireland with my family for the holidays, and I just got back to LA.  How is everybody?
