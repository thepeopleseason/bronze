Casey -- your comments do mean a lot.  thank you.<BR>
<BR>
LadyW asked about the time it takes to write an ep.  About oh... maybe 1 to 2 weeks to "break it" (figure out the story and the scenes) -- a day to outline it, a week to write it, a week to rewrite it / polish it.<BR>
<BR>
Someone (delf?) asked about bringing back Danny Strong... an interesting notion.  I dunno.  Maybe.<BR>
<BR>
Liddie -- hee hee.  I promised shirtless and I delivered shirtless.  You didn't ask for specifics.<BR>
<BR>
Hey... I gotta go watch my eppy now!  Talk to y'all later!

NuPhalanx... the evil that Willow sensed was Ethan.<BR>
<BR>
Swoop -- i think Tom (I like to call him Tom) was referring to writer/producers which is what I am.  (well I'm a co-producer, which isn't really a producer, but next year... oh dear, it's so complicated).  Anyway, what Tom meant was that in TV we writers/producers get to tell the directors how we want the episode to look.  In movies the vision very much belongs to the directors.<BR>
<BR>
Kameko -- why does Ethan do what he does?  Well, he worships Chaos.  (personally I think he also has some Giles-envy issues, but those are mostly just in my mind.)<BR>
<BR>
Pilgrim:  I can't say if there will be a whole  Xander-centric ep this season, but I promise you he'll have much coolness in the future.<BR>
<BR>
carl -- I know about SPAGHETTI -- met some members at the last PBP... perhaps they signed me up.

To the Anya fans -- I agree she's great, one of my faves to write for.   I'm giving her lots of stuff in my next ep.<BR>
<BR>
BlackAria -- well, I think people react to the end of a relationship in different ways.  Like Buffy, I tend to sort of block it out... it can hurt too much to think about it.  I don't think it's necessarily a shallow reaction.   The fling with Parker was all about Angel -- it was her trying to move on too fast... that's why the pain lingered so long, in my opinion... because it was really about Angel -- she was wondering if Angel was the start of a pattern she would live out the rest of her life.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to all those saying such great things about me.  Did I hear the word Goddess?   Kewl.

The name of the kind of demons is spelled "Fyarl" -- someone asked about this.<BR>
<BR>
And Hokiefan asked if that was Jenny C. in this ep -- nope, just a Sunnydale mom.

<BR>
Ooh.<BR>
I'm seeing worry-face out there.  Don't.  Xander isn't phasing out.  Anya will be around.  I wouldn't even be surprised to see some old friends in a couple of eps.<BR>
<BR>
And about Willow and Tara... are you asking what they do in private?  We don't write those scenes, so I guess you could say we don't know either.   What you see is what there is.

<BR>
starting to get confused, but let's try... <BR>
<BR>
lotus asked something... what was it?  About stunts... oh yeah.  I just write 'em in the script roughly how they should look, what the feel of them should be.  I never talk directly to the stunt people, but Joss does and the director does.<BR>
<BR>
carl asked about the shooting schedule.   each ep shoots for eight working days and  I think they're just starting to shoot ep 16 now.

Oh so many names.  Hi to buggy, Charity, Karen, Gifted, scram (sorry you haven't seen the new eps),  Slayergrl.<BR>
<BR>
I don't think it's reruns next week -- should be new... we can ask the East Coasters who've already seen the previews.

lotus -- actually we get most of our ideas by starting in the real world and then finding the metaphor in the Buffyverse.  So we start with something like 'a bad roommate' or 'dad's feeling left out' and then try to find the interesting demon-bas<i></i>ed way to tell the story.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.

No, that can't be right.  March?  I dunno.  You'll see it.  It'll have my name on it.  It'll all work out.<BR>

Jen 15,  I'm turning in my next ep tomorrow or the day after, and it will air -- 0h gosh, it's episode 17 and this was ep 12... so late February I guess?  I think you'll like it -- the idea was Joss' and it's a funny one.
