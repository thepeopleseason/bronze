<DD>BuffyS: hmm, that's an early air-time for this show: I spose they gotta cut it. I'll remember that when I slave over the grindstone doing my fight music!<BR>
SarahNicole: I'll email and take a look at the survey<BR>
Aja: Thanks muchly! Season two will be bigger and better in the music department, we are having lots of fun!<BR>
<BR>
ANYWAY, I was supposed to just check the colors, gotta run, lots of notes (musical) to write! Bye for now! ROB.

<DD><b>Circe</b> and <b>MeeBola</b>: no, seriously -- all the good parts are Jossian in origin. though i did have a line that has "boobs" in it. you'll have to watch for that one. and that's all the spoilers i'm givin'.  as for BTVS, i'm completely, 100%, no-turning-back spoiled spoiled spoiled. and i LURVE it.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Slayergrl99</b>: i came up with my ultracool board name in this way: my parents named me "Meredyth", and i shortened it to "-mere-". i know, i know -- it's hard to remain in the presence of such coolness without wetting oneself, but try to maintain.<BR>

<DD><b>DarkLady</b>: but the panic's part of the FUN!  you know, which is fun... 'cause of... the FUN!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Leather Jacket</b>: yes, but there's nothing like watching the eppies with those commercials in the middle to draw out the anticipation and excitement, you know? <small>i'm sick. i know this. somewhere, an adman smiles...</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Lady of the Lake</b>: i tried doing that Superman thing, where i fly around the world really really fast in order to reverse the rotation of the world, but then i remembered that that makes time go <i>backwards</i> rather than <i>forwards</i>, and i wound up on last Thursday. and boy, did that suck -- four extra days to wait! <small>and that whole story was really lame, but it's too late now, 'cause i forgot where i stashed the "delete" key.</small><BR>

<b>TC via Corpelia</b>: gee, NO PRESSURE OR ANYTHING!!! <small>pass the Schnapps.</small><BR>

<b>SunnyD</b>: i'll give you the stock answer: trust in Joss. <small>and yes, stock answers suck. i am aware.</small><BR>

<b>kim!</b>: thanks for the invite -- <b>AKABECKER</b> mentioned it to me this morning, too -- but i <i>do</i>, unfortunately, have previous plannage.  and the bud in question would saw off my head with a dull butter knife were i to backpedal.  so, being that i am somewhat attached to my head -- only in the most literal sense -- i think i'll have to decline.  but again, thanks!<BR>

<BR>
<b>jengod</b>: while i truly <i>adore</i> your Jesus-and-apostle metaphor, it was more like Jesus-and-tiny-lizard-in-desert-he-took-pity-on. i'm a reptilian apostle-in-waiting.<BR>
