<DD><b>Last post, 'cause now I have to get to the post office for those lousy Brits!  j/k</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>cabin7dad:</b>  Hi!  That's adorable!  I'm so glad she has such *ahem* excellent taste in music!  (Although how anyone could like anything better than the Beatles...I just don't know!)  =)<BR>
<b>Dr Lectre:</b>  hmmmm....poem topic......Napster?  LOL  No, really....how about the unbearable heat we're enduring here in LA?  ;-)<BR>
<b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  YAY..it's gonna be fun!  And I don't know...we could go to the back and have dinner...then sneak her through the pool table area.  (???)<BR>
<b>Prophet6:</b>  Now, now...let's not disparage any bands!  =)  (Although I <i>love</i> having someone who appreciates and supports us like you do!)<BR>
<b>Matt the Bruins Fan:</b>  Why, thank you!  =)  Nope, I didn;t get bruised...not that I recall, anyway!<BR>
<b>FASTEDDIE:</b>  You're so welcome!  We had a great time.<BR>
<b>DeAn:</b>  Nope, I don't think so...but it has a similar vibe.<BR>
<b>AlyRosenberg:</b>  Our following has expanded greatly due to Buffy (the show and soundtrack), and we're very grateful.  =)<BR>
<b>Paris_Angel:</b>  I know what you mean...and that's why we have 6 songs authorized for FREE downloads.  They're on our site, they're on mp3.com, they're on Napster.  No problem.  But having our entire song catalogue available is a little much, IOHO.  (in our humble opinion hehe)<BR>
<b>DreamLurker:</b>  Yep, that's the point.  =)<BR>
<BR>
OK, outta here.  Hope to see you LA Bronzers at the LIVE RECORDING this Monday!<BR>
<BR>
We're playing at Temple Bar, in Santa Monica, at 7pm.  It's FREE.  We're recording it for a live album.  And videotaping it, too.  We're providing free food.  It's gonna be a blast!  =)  More details at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>
<BR>

<DD><b>TMorel & Jennie:</b>  I need your address NOW!  ;-)  (I'm going to run to the post office before they close.  Which is in 1 1/2 hours.)  We're also throwing in a few extra surprises for you guys.  (Jeff's idea...he's cool, too.  hehe)  E-mail me!<BR>
<b>KAT:</b>  Hey!  Thanks!  Bye!<BR>
<b>ducky:</b>  You're welcome!  =)<BR>
<b>Sci-Fi Bard:</b>  To get a free VC sticker, all you have to do is send us a <b>self-addressed, stamped envelope.</b>  That's it.  =)  Send it to:<BR>

<b>Vanessa:</b>  Yep, I get ya.  And thanks so much for buying our CDs!  =)  But you see my point...not everyone's going to be as cool as you.  Especially in the future, when you can burn a perfect-sounding CD in 5 minutes off your T-1 line, or whatever.  That's when it'll get sticky.<BR>
<b>Prophet 6:</b>  I have that same import!  It's kinda green...and it's Japanese...and their hair looks ridiculous!  hehehe  But I bought it in about '85...  I found it in an import store in NYC.  =)

<DD><b>Sci-Fi Bard:</b>  Hi there!  Didn't see your post to me.  =)  A poem?  Why not?<BR>
<b>DeAn:</b>  Eek!  I haven't gotten around to doing your interview yet, have I?  Ack! I will!  I will! (sorry!)<BR>
<b>Willow's Gimp:</b>  I understand your point, however, once the technology is perfected - which we all know won't take very long - and mp3's sound <i>exactly</i> as good as the original CD, why would people still buy the actual product, if they can get it for free?  For the artwork on the CD case?  I'm not so sure...  Of course, if someone's a big fan (e.g. me and Duran Duran), they'll buy your stuff regrdless.  (Like I said to Prophet6, I have all these B-sides and stuff on bootleg cassette, but I also purchased every single Duran Duran recording I could get my hands on here in the states.)  It's just a concern for the future, you know?  It worries us.  (We're poor!)<BR>
<b>Kiba Rika:</b>  Yeah...see - that part, I get.  I <i>like</i> that people are finding out about us through trading mp3s and stuff...it's just the inevitable conclusion that such unregulated trading will lead to that frightens me.  You know?<BR>
<b>SocKs:</b>  Well, there's the MTV thing.  That's cool.  And the live recording on Monday.  very cool.  And we're doing an unplugged type thing tomorrow night.  Cool again.  =)

<DD><b>Prophet6:</b>  I'm really looking forward to the CD!  I have (I'm pretty sure) ALL the B-sides and stuff... but I have a lot of them (including Secret Oktober) on a very worn, fading, sorry little bootleg cassette I've had since 1985!  I do have a ton of 12" imports, though.  =)  but the songs that I have only on bad cassette are:  Faster Than Light, Khanada, Secret Oktober, Late Bar, um....I can't remember them all off the top of my head.  yay!  Can't wait.<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  Got it.  Thanks!  'Night!<BR>
<b>TheName:</b>  Thanks very much for understanding our position!  =)  And of course, for your support!

<DD><b>Dream Lurker:</b>  RSO to you!<BR>
<b>Thoin:</b>  Thanks!  What a nice drive-by!<BR>
<b>elusio:</b> That's OK!  We appreciate your doing it in the first place!<BR>
<b>SocKs:</b>  Hiya!  =)<BR>
<b>ducky:</b>  Why, thanks!  I really appreciate that...but nope, no touring in the near future.  You can hear our stuff on that new MTV show, "Live Through This," though. They used 3 of our songs (well, 2 and a smidge) in the first episode, and they're using one of them AGAIN in the 2nd episode...I didn't get a chance to watch it, 'cause I had rehearsal.  But they said they were opening episode 2 with our song, "You Got Me," so that's cool.  =)<BR>
<b>TMorel & Jennie:</b>  Hi!  I know!  What a travesty!  lol  You really want some stickers?  'Cause I can pop a few (like 25 or so) in the post airmail today...you might get them in time.  Let me know.

<DD><b>Prophet 6:</b>  Hey!  Yep, I got it, and yep, I'd love to have that CD, and Yay!  =)<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Awwwwwwww...well, someday soon we'll tour - I hope!  ;-)  I'm really looking forward to this live recording gig on Monday.  =)<BR>
<b>Kiba Rika:</b>Thank you, and tell your sister hi for me.  =)<BR>
<b>Vanessa:</b>  Hey!<BR>
<b>Ralph II:</b>  I personally have every intention of attending.  I'm looking forward to just hanging out at the party for once!  (As opposed to performing...)<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  Hey you!  How are you?<BR>
<b>Spacebabie:</b>  Hehehe...well, there's always another auction, right?  =)  Hi!<BR>
<b>Lady of the Lake:</b>  Hello!  Nice to meet you.  Nope, no touring in the near future...which is a bummer, but oh well.<BR>
<b>kawaii_Marc:</b>  Hello!  Very interesting you should ask that, becaue we recently sent out an e-mail stating our concerns over the whole Napster thing, and it's sparked a bit of a debate among fans.  hehehe  But basically, we love the idea that people are spreaing the word about Velvet Chain, and we have 6 songs available as mp3s that we specifically authorized for free downloads, but when it comes down to being able to download an artist's entire body of work for free...that's very scary for an independent artists who depends on every single CD sale to squeak by.  That's our basic concern.  We'd like there to be some form of payment to the artists, and some say over what's out there.  (Hope that doesn't upset anybody, but that's how we feel about it.)<BR>
<b>greeneyes:</b>  Ooh!  I'd love to go to Atlanta...I have a good friend there, so maybe I can sweing by sometime.  =)
