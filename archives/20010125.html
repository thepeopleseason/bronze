<DD>last one...gotta run (BZ,BZ,BZ)<BR>
<BR>
gotta say that I'm looking forward to both series home stretches. diggin' on Glory and the dark Angel (NOT Dark Angel...James Cameron's first sucky product and proof that I won't watch just cuz there's a cute girl *g*)<BR>
<BR>
My apologies to my buds and others for not answering everyone back (gotta clear out and did I mention this computer REALLY sucks).<BR>

<DD>oops...I meant pre-PBP party NOT PBP (y'all knew that but I'm anal...wipe that smile off your face *g*).<BR>
<BR>
I'll go to any party that'll have me (wipe that smile off your face *g*)<BR>
<BR>
Atto's departure is of a friendly nature and he'll be on the recordings we're doing right now. Gerri will not be performing at the pre-party as she'll be on tour at the time. She will appear with us again.<BR>
We will have a cellist whose name is Sarah.<BR>
<BR>
We're working on a tab book for all who've asked for guitar tabs. Look for it soon on our site.<BR>
<BR>
<i>God, I sound like an infomercial crossed with "Flowers For Algernon"</i> *g*<BR>
<BR>
leaving soon

<DD>'K, I'm on a crappy comp so I'll just answer as best I can.<BR>
<BR>
No color cuz I never got new codes and just figured a regular guy should post regular. I'm just lazy!<BR>
<BR>
PBP will likely be our last show with the beloved Atto on board as he's returning to his native Mexico. <i>Us and Metallica at the same time</i>.<BR>
<BR>
We're working on a new record (four songs right now) earmarked to become a full-length.

<DD>SO's to all my friends (and those who shall be)!<BR>
<BR>
It's official: Darling Violetta will be playing the PBP pre-party on 2/16/01 at the Key Club in L.A. Even if you've seen us before, come one come all cuz changes are in the wind in the DV camp.<BR>
<BR>
Be sure to get your DV shirts, keychains and knick-knacks (not the guy from "The Man With the Golden Gun", silly). <BR>
<BR>
