I'll scroll later...<BR>
<BR>
Sachiel - I'm working on it.<BR>

<DD>Hi Mandy.  Thanks Blackheart.  Hi Gregg.<BR>
<BR>
Last post.  Going to see a concert by the YMF (Young Musician's Foundation) orchestra.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - three of my favorite score moments so far this season, in no particular order:<BR> Buffy hesitantly approaching a crazed Angel in B&tB<BR> Those kooky chocolate-influenced adults-acting-like-kids causing a ruckus in BC (day after tomorrow...)<BR> The very last scene in Revelations (week from Tues.)<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - there you go putting words in my mouth.  A 9 out of 10 means I didn't like it so much?<BR>
<BR>
devil - Yes, new theme (though not much of one - it's probably the simplest little tune I've come up with for this show) for X/W - I've been using acoustic guitar.<BR>
<BR>
melanie - currently getting maximum rotation on my CD player:  Bjork, stereolab, the new Elvis Costello/Burt Bacharch thing.<BR>
<BR>
Bye everyone.

<DD>Posting in the Erika co-lor.<BR>
<BR>
Jennifer Lynn - oooooh thanks for reminding me about L&O.  My OTHER favorite non-Buffy show.  (Useless-but-makes-me-look-cool trivia - 3 years ago I wrote music for several eps of Law & Order - uncredited.)<BR>
<BR>
Missi - Yeah I saw the Cupcakes fan club.  I'm honored.  How many members so far?  How often do you rehearse?  FYI here's a sampling of our repertoire (this is for real BTW):<BR> "Stepping Out" by Joe Jackson<BR> a cheesy early 80's ballad called "The Hardest Part of Love is Letting Go" by... (anyone?)<BR> a couple of originals whose titles I have completely forgotten.  Oh wait. "Caravelle"?  (If memory serves...  I sure hope I'm wrong...)<BR>
These were played instrumentally only, no singer (!), with a line up of a drummer, a piano player (me), a synth player, and a drummer.  It was really and truly as cringeworthy as it sounds.  We played only a few "gigs", the biggest being a lunchtime 30-minute set in our junior high auditorium.  Ahh the memories!  Flooding the senses!  Makes me feel 13, short and insecure all over again.<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - my request for a cameo was politely laughed off.  Make that cackled off.<BR>
<BR>
RJ - John King (see below).  Hoping anew for non-killage from Mr. King.<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - the absolute hardest thing to do, after I watch a new episode, is to not go out and see a movie, followed by TV, followed by the PB, followed by several days of time wastage, only to finally start working at the very last possible minute.  Well, actually, it's so hard I've never managed to do it.  Coming up with ideas is always easy for me.  Especially under pressure, which is why the hardest part is not wasting time.  <BR>
<BR>
New record!  Longest post I've ever!<BR>
<BR>
And it gets longer.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - I'm sure that was part of it.  If you play that scene with score, you can't ahve it from the beginning of the scene like you can the song (it would just play for too long and get annoying).  And the minute that score comes in, you KNOW "something's gonna happen..."  So good point.

<DD>Yo Sarah W.  I like ep 8 only as much as you like the green.  Well probably a little more.  My favorite so far.  I say that a lot I know.<BR>
<BR>
Which brings me to a new paragraph.  Anybody who asks me my opinion of a Buffy ep that hasn't aired yet may have noticed I seem to like every ep more than the last.  And you probably will conclude (correctly!) that my opinion counts for absolutely zero.  I love every episode more than the last not because I'm shamelessly butt-kissing - more because I *want* to like the episodes, so I can get into that creative work zone thingie.  It happens on every project I work on, whether Buffy or non.  I can't be trusted.<BR>
<BR>
So: if I say I don't like an ep, you KNOW it's gonna suck.  Call it an upside.<BR>
<BR>
Having said that, ep 8 ROCKS.  Truly.  Ignore what I said above.<BR>
<BR>
Will I regain some credibility if I give "Some Assembly Required" only a 9 out of 10?<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and I haven't seen ep 9 or 10, but they've been described to me in great detail and all's I can say is - yowzah!

<DD>DeMoriel - send a tape or CD to the production offices, to John King's attention.  He pre-screens all the the music.  And I hope he doesn't kill me for publicly posting that.  Oh, and precolumbian music sounds like it could be cool.  Look for it in an upcoming episode...<BR>
<BR>
...Anxiously awaiting 9 pm to watch my favorite non-Buffy show...<BR>
<BR>
Kidding about precolumbian.

<DD>Ah green.  Ah, the power. <BR>
<BR>
Jennifer Lynn - see below.  And I will elaborate - if I wanted to I'm sure I could voice my opinion.  Whether anyone would listen is another matter entirely.  And the missus is not in the vicinity but I'll pass the good wishes along.  Those were good wishes right?<BR>
<BR>
Fax1 - I just keep seeing scenes where the B/A theme would be perfect, and I can't help myself.  Moderation is the key, I suppose.  And re: its on-again-off-again-ness, B/A is the Michael Jordan of Buffy themes.

<DD>Bonjour melanie.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Laurence and Sarah W. (good luck loading the board), Sanguineus, Shadow Slayer<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - re: Lisa Loeb vs. Score, I'm not sure if there was a particular reason they went for that specific song.  It sure felt like a Dawson's Creek moment - on the one hand, Lisa Loeb is cool (good song, plus less work for me!) but on the other, maybe scoring that scene would have resulted in a better match between music and visuals.  Personally, I think the scene is strong enough that either works well.  OK, was that diplomatic enough?<BR>
<BR>
Lisa - I've tried to involve my wife in the PB.  She just gets bored.  WUWT?<BR>
<BR>
RJ - I don't have anything to do with the song selection.  I write the background (instrumental) music.  Why do you ask?  Do I detect a little antifastballian slant?<BR>
<BR>
Sachiel - let me get back to you on the dinner-alive-or-dead thingie.

<DD>Hey Sunday Bronzers.<BR>
<BR>
Had dinner with the lovely & talented Erika Amato and the lovely & talented Jeff Stacy a few nights ago...  Lotsa fun.  That was definitely a first: never before have I had dinner with someone I met on the Internet.  Diggin' my VC CD too.  And they convinced me to go to the PBP here in LA in Feb.  (Well, I was already thinking of going anyway, so no convincing was really needed...)<BR>
<BR>
In the thick of working on episode 8 (Spike's), featuring the long-overdue if subtle return of the B/A love theme.  Work is going well.  So far.<BR>
<BR>
I'm taking the rest of the day off, and much to my wife's dismay, here I am!
