Mabb - LOL.  String quartets = very evil.  Or very sweet.  Depends how far along we are in the episode.<BR>
<BR>
BOREANZ IS HOT - try emailing David at christophebeck@yahoo.com.<BR>
<BR>
Jennifer Lynn - I won't vote.  I'd rather just observe.<BR>
<BR>
WolfByte, AngelLover24-7, zaner - thanks (I'd love to see that Halloween bootleg)<BR>
<BR>
BOREANZ IS HOT - actually, don't.  I was just funnin.<BR>
<BR>
DSP/BNerd - LOL.  The Buffy/Faith theme... I love it.<BR>
<BR>
Happy New Year!<BR>

second-to-last post...  muffins or no, tummy is growling...<BR>
<BR>
Buffy Book - I only just found out about the awards.  If I can't be there in person I'll definitely scroll back after the fact...<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow - the next Buffy Magazine will have a pic of me in a tux holding my Emmy.  Feel free to use it.<BR>
<BR>
Pixie - Sometimes no question is the best question.<BR>
<BR>
I have never felt so safe as I do now that the SW/LW/DG triumverate has finally coalesced  - and while I'm here no less!<BR>
<BR>
Kara - I know zilch re: soundtrack.  But this rumor... makes me mad.  I hope fans of the show are not too disappointed when the ST comes out; I fear this will be more of a "songs inspired by" type deal than actual songs from the show.  TVT records may want to push their own artists, whether or not they've appeared on the show.   Again, I don't know anything one way or another, but too many times I've seen it happen (typically in films) that the music from the actual film or show, whether score or songs, is dropped in favor of songs that have nothing to do with the show.  I personally think TVT would be incredibly foolish to escalate this trend by not having the theme on the CD.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - so I've heard.  70 (farneheit) today in LA...<BR>
<BR>
poohbeee - I'm a big Carter Burwell fan.  ("Fargo" got me hooked).  You're probably thinking of "Film Score Monthly".  I don't know of a "F S Quarterly".  I hang with colleagues quite a bit actually.  Marco Beltrami (Scream, Scream 2, The Faculty) and Jon Ehrlich (Roar, Party of 5) were both in my class at USC and we stay in touch.  In fact Jon & I were both nominated for Emmys this past year.  Too bad I had to kick his ass.<BR>
<BR>
Kar - unfortunately there is no sheet music for the B/A love theme.  You'll just have to pick it out by ear like RyanH did.

Buff Sheridan - thanks, and to answer your question:<BR>

SPOILERS FOR "HELPLESS"<BR>

<s>I'm gonna use a string quartet... oooooooohhhhh...</s><BR>

SPOILERS FOR "HELPLESS"<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and "My Way" in LW was Gary Oldman as Sid Vicious form the "Sid & Nancy" soundtrack.<BR>
<BR>
Hellos and thanks to NuPhalanx, Trixie, AjO, Will-O, Lovely Poet, VT, Shadowslayer, and Cirrus the Tidy<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - no response from TV James.  Yellow it is for now.  And, re: "Ted", it's definitely one of my favorites from s2.  Sometimes you just need to hear the music unencumbered by dialog and SFX (especially when it's a less-than-excellent episode) to get the full effect.<BR>
<BR>
Chrissy - e me the form.  Not silly at all.  OK a little silly.  A lot actually.  e it to me anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Missi - which award are you presenting?<BR>
<BR>
Marissa - I can't take all the credit.  Great performances + writing + directing can make you cry all on their very own.  I'm just here to help nudge you that little weensy bit over the edge...

Hey FSM CD Man.  Been enjoying your little gift to me over the holidays... thanks again.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks & hellos (variously) to A Polite Newbie, Mabb, Pixie<BR>
<BR>
Charity - Do not know if Joss is an "Anne of Green Gables" fan.  What I do know is that they're currently making another "Anne" miniseries.  (I know because I tried - unsuccesfully - to get the composing gig.)<BR>
<BR>
Theatergirl - LOL!<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - Yeah, I'm gonna make you cry.  But first (and at length) I'm gonna scare the pants off ya.  Did you see all the people ask me to say hi to you?  Hi!  Oh, one more thing... I have a strong suspicion that NY guy selling those videos is doing so illegally.  I'm not 100% sure about the dailies (though it sounds illegal to me) but I know that selling the complete episodes is copyright infringement.  Just thought I'd let ya know.<BR>
<BR>
Litlle Will - (with mouth full) Goo muffims, fank woo

Hellos to Briolette and ?<BR>
<BR>
Fax - I never said my trip was fun.  It <i>was</i> for the most part, especially if you don't consider the yearly family revert-back-to-familiar-patterns-isms.  I got to see my 3 month old niece for the first time too.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Sarah W!  Come back!<BR>
<BR>
Oh,and I was supposed to do this a while ago, but I forgot.  Congrats to devil on your acceptance to Georgetown.  (How'd I do, fax?)</SMALL>

Happy New Year Bronzers.<BR>
<BR>
I did make it to Canada & back with no problems.  In fact my green card was <b>exactly where my wife told me it would be</b>.  I just didn't look hard enough the first time.  grr argh<BR>
<BR>
I'm back, slightly flu-ish, and about to start on ep 12.<BR>
<BR>
Hope y'all had nice xmases.<BR>
<BR>
