<dd>Bye, <b>DeAn</b>!<br><b>Old One:</b>  Hey!  The auditions went well, to greater and lesser degrees, but I still haven't booked a new musical yet.  I will, though.  It's just a matter of time.  =)  And I'm still in the running for one of them.  We'll see.<br><br>

<dd><b>DeAn:</b>  How exciting!  That's great!  Now, I just have to figure out how we're getting over there!!  ;-)<br><b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  Heya!  You're very welcome.  Long time, no see, eh?  I've been very well, thanks.  Very busy this year doing lots of plays (mostly musicals and such) and working on the new Velvet Chain album, which will be coming out in November.  How about you?<br><br>
