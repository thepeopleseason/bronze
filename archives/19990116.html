<DD><b>RJ:</b>  7 years. thank you very much!  Actually, I was quite clever.  I'd play into the teacher's ego.  (I had about 4 different ones)  I'd say, "Could you please play it through for me, so I can get a feel for the nuances..."  Somethng like that.  Then, it's be stuck in my head.  I know it's hard to believe, but my brain's just like that.  In the band, they call me The Computer.  Or compare me to a tape recorder.  Play it for me, and I'll play it back.  All the parts.  Anyway, once I got home, I'd practice the heck out of it, by ear.  I'd know if a note was off.  I'd rememebr the timing.  Every once in a while I might double-check a note or a beat (quarter-note, sixteenth, triplet, whatever) but very rarely.  So I never really learned to read music.  I'm actually not proud of it.  It was lazy of me.  But I managed.<BR>

<b>Natty:</b>Oh!  You asked about the CDs before, didn't you?  Well, they're not available in Canada except at HMV as an import...they're RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  Don't buy it!  lol  If you can get your hands on a U.S. money-ordr, you can always order straight from me.  E-mail me if you're interested.  As ofr the Buffy soundtrack, we just spoke to TVT records, and they cannot confirm or deny that we'll be on it.  They did say it won't be out 'til the Fall, now.  (I hate to say I told you so, but...well I guess I just did.)<BR>
<b>Angela:</b>  Thanks!<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  Hehehe..I have seen that one, but does she say "D'amato?"  I can't remember.  That's pretty cool!  =)<BR>
<b>Acid Cross:</b>  Cool.  I'm doing an indie-film with some friends, as well.  Well, the director's my friend, and I hope th rest of the cast will become my friends, as well!<BR>
<b>Meteor:</b>  Any and all ideas are welcome!

<b>Acid Cross:</b>  Ah, yes?  Cool.  I moved out here to act, but the music took over!  (I've always done both, though.)  Are you in L.A.?<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>  Thanks!  I tried...  but now you know why sometimes the mouths are so way off when a band appears on a show!<BR>

<DD><b>Natty:</b>  Well, I used to take piano lessons...for many years. actually, and here's what happened:  I faked my way through 7 years of lessons!  I faked my way through Bach, Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven, Scott Joplin, you name it.  This my sound strange, but I was so good at "sounding things out" that I never really bothered to learn hoe to read music!  I can sight-read signing, since i's only one line at a time, but as for piano music, I'm still at the every-good-boy-does-fine stage!  Funny, ain't it?<BR>
<B>VaBuffyFan:</b>Oh, you're in for a treat!  Many new songs...some of which will have NEVER been performed in public before!  And yes, we will do the Buffy song, too.  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Dianne:</b>Hi and Bye!  =)<BR>
<b>bec:</b>I definitely will after we play.  Beforehand, I probably won't.  It's too much strain on my voice to talk to so many people before a show, you know?  ('Cause there's always very loud music playing, so I have to shout to be heard...)  After I sing, I won't care if I scream all night!  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>HollyFrog:</b>  We were signed on an indie label called Overall Records.  They put out our Warm album.  We decided to take the plunge and go solo again, though...they really didn' have any money.  (Which is part of the reason why Warm is STILL backordered.  Ack.)  Anyway, we're currently being shopped, and hope to score another deal (preferably with a major, but a well-funded indie will do) soon! =)<BR>

<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>  thanks!  It's gonna rock.  I give you my word.  =)<BR>
<b>StGermain:</b>  That's SUCH a compliment, you have no idea!  Not only did we lipsynch...we had to do it with no music playing!!  Talk about TOUGH.  See, what they did was, they'd start the scene, the cameras would roll, then they'd start playing the CD.  We'd begin to lipsynch, (for maybe 5 seconds) and then they'd turn it off, so that Buffy, Owen, whoever... so that their dialogue would be heard.  We had to continue to keep time in our heads, etc.  It was pretty silly.  They were dancing to silence most of the time!  hehe<BR>
<b>Miguel:</b>  Cool!  I'm so glad you'll get a chance to see us!  Make sure you say hi.<BR>
<b>Acid Cross:</b>  cool!  Nice to meet you.

<DD>Howdy, I'm back!<BR>
<BR>
To answer a few earlier posts...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Zaner:</b>  Well, Chris Beck's job is to compose music that matches the scene.  He actually watches the dailies, then comes up with appropriate scoring.  (And does a FABULOUS job of it, too!)  The bands, on the other hand, are chosen because their music already seems to fit in.  So, the two songs we have on NKABOTFD were already recorded, and they placed them on the show.<BR>
<b>MudPuppy:</b>  You didn't ask anything, but you were sweet, so THANKS.<BR>
<b>APolite Newbie:</b>  Yes, I did receive the CD...thanks a bunch!  I gave it a listen, and I have to say, they're good, but just not my cup of tea.  It's cool that you have such eclectic taste in music!!!  =)</SMALL>

<DD>OK, so posting from work was not such a good idea this time...<BR>
<BR>
Thank you so much to all the people who bothered to come on and say hi, and that they liked VC's music, etc.  It means a lot to me!  =)<BR>
<BR>
I'm closing up, now (Ah, the joys of a day-job), but I'll post again once I get home.  Hopefully, I'll see some of you then!  (8:30 or 9pm)<BR>

Ciao!<BR>
