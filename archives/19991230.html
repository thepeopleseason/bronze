<DD>LJC: I am indeed from the band...I play the guitar but I prefer to think of myself as a musician who happens to play guitar rather than as a guitarist (I wrote the cello part for the Angel theme and there's very little guitar audible in that). Thanks for the compliment!<BR>
<BR>
Gonna pop over to our club at yahoo called VioletDarlings (started by the Bronze's own Kenickie) if anyone cares to do the chat thing...back for LOSERS</vgreen>

<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Cool!  I hope we can chat, as well!  =)<BR>
<b>carl:</b>  Well, there's just FSM and Velvet Chain, as far as "performers" go, and we <i>are</i> both rock bands, so...<BR>
<b>Miremba:</b>  They approached us, actually.  And we're super-glad they did!  =)  Here's the addy:  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<b>Jimbo:</b>  Yes, your position is secure!<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure I've missed people, but I have dinner on the stove, and I'm totally procrastinating on my laundry, and I just really have to jet!  =)  HAPPY NEW YEAR!<BR>

<DD>OK, I've got to get going...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Mesuvius:<b>  Cool!  Glad they were a hit.  E- me your new address, OK?  (Is your e-mail still the same?  That's the most important thing.)<BR>
<b>Drop Kick Girl:</b>  Thanks!  That's my very own dress.  I'm afraid it's a bit dated-looking now, but it <i>was</i> pretty d@mn hip in '96, when we shot the episode!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Miremba:</b>  You should be able to find the "Buffy EP" by Velvet Chain at Tower Records.  Some Tower and Virgin stores also carry "Warm."  When in doubt, order it by mail via our website.  (You can send a check via the mail if e-commerce doesn't float your boat.)<BR>
<b>Jen:</b>  No, I don't think we'll be giving away free copies...but I'm sure somehow they'll get copied and distributed, just like everything seems to!  The video is really for our own promotional purposes.  We will use it to "shop" oursleves to the industry.  Of course, you never know where it could end up, but it is not likely to be on MTV or anything.

<DD><b>Old One:</b>  Nope, no big plans.  Nice to meet you!<BR>
<b>FASTEDDIE:</b>  thanks for the First!<BR>
<b>Angelicious:,/b>  Yes, I got your e-mail!  I'll try and get back to you ASAP.  I know I can swing the first thing you requested, but your second request may be more difficult...<BR>
<b>Opus:</b>  OK, I'm 90% sure I've told you this already, but no, she is not working on Green Sails.  It doesn't really look like that's going to get picked up.  She is out of the country on vacation.  And yes, actually Velvet Chain will be headlining at the PBP.  (FSM will be playing before us!)  Should be really realy fun.

<BR>
<b>Willow182:</b>  Our song is track #4, "Strong," just after the track by Garbage.<BR>
<b>SlayedMyself:</b>NO, you do NOT have to be over 18.  We're filming in the club before business hours.  No worries on the age thing.  =)</SMALL>

<DD>Hi, guys...<BR>
<BR>
Just stopping by to say <b>HAPPY NEW YEAR</b> in adavnce!  (I have to work tomorrow, and then I'm going out to dinner, so I probably won't have any time to check in then.)<BR>
<BR>
Just a reminder:  We're shooting a video for our song "Beyond Time" (from the next VC album) on January 10th, and we need EXTRAS!  (We're shooting from 11am to 3pm in the "plush room" at the Key Club.)  If you live in the SoCal area and are at all interested, e- me!
