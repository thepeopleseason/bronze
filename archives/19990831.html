<DD>Damn you XG!  Long live Machida!  Snake Boy Rules.  He's every bit as tough as that giant 8 foot tall Demon who foolishly walked over and stabbed himself on Buffy's pole when she was being burned at the stake.  (How about that one?  If I'd only had an Uzi then dagnab it)  Sure... "it'll be fine Jeff" they said... "It's not about the fights" they told me...<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Well... I gotta go and hit the sack (as in the bed)  I think that tomorrow I will suggest to Sarah that she switch over to the Brittany Spear look full time.*<BR>
<BR>
*if I don't come back for a while it is only because my fingers were broken after said Spears costume suggestion.<BR>

<DD>XG - If I did then a giant snake-like thingy would come and thump me on the head.<BR>
<BR>
But I can say that Oz does have a Halloween costume idea.  I will watch on the day and see if anyone has guessed correctly.<BR>
<BR>
Ithink Sarah should have come as her heroine, Brittany Spears.  Just in case anyone should change into their costume again we could have some bouncy, happy  tunes.  With the emphasis on bouncy.  (I'm just a guy anyway)</SMALL>

<BR>
Hmmm  That could be better than a giant snake-thingy Mayor.  I'd better alert Joss to that.  Could be a possible guest shot villain.

and<BR>
<BR>

<DD>I gave the current guy the thumbs up.  He did stunts in one of my old movies called MartiAL OUTLAW.  If you ever see a guy in that particular flick getting his legs swept out from under him and hitting chest-first on a metal rail then you will know that's the Angel stunt coordinator.  He told me later it was the hardest fight he'd ever done.  I'm also in it doubling the star for his crashes.<BR>
<BR>
Plus my old Angel stunt double , Mike Massa, is there too.

<DD>carl - I'll bet they were Susan Lucci fans.  hmmm<BR>
<BR>
Bri - Yeah.  Like how about that nut who badgered Sophia?  I'll bet Sarah has a million of those guys running around.  That's why we have such ultra-tight security.  I'm afraid to demo any punch to her.  I could be shot!  Boy!  The actors life is certainly unique.  That I can say for sure.

<DD>Nastasia - I don't normally comment on anyones relationship to anyone else, but I think you'd better not listen to much to that stuff.  I do know who dates who around there and it really is nothing like anything I've ever read.  Except for David and Ingrid.  <BR>
<BR>
However, speaking for myself:  David did flash me one time so I can only assume it was a sexual thing and I plan on a lawsuit for millions (excuse me) BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!<BR>

<DD>thanks Slain.<BR>
<BR>
horizon - No time to be in both places.  I was going to do it while it was still on the Buffy studio lot.  Then we outgrew our space and Angel had to move out and rent studio space elsewhere.  Plus Sarah asked that I not devide my time between two shows.<BR>
<BR>
But I still love David G and David B.  I miss seeing those guys everyday.

<DD>Bri - Acting sure is a weird job alright.  It must mess with your head.  One minute you're laughed at because you want to be one, then if something miraculous happens and you get a good gig suddenly if you drop your coat there will be ten people there to pick it up as if you were the President or something.  That's gotta be strange.  Plus you can't go to the 7-11 store without people gawking at you.  How weird is that?  Whoa.

<DD>Margot - I didn't want them to actually mention that in the magazine about DARK NEXUS.  It's only in the early stage of writing right now.  Some of the guys from THE MATRIX are involved in it and want to produce it for around 2 million.  We'll see.  We get so many offers to do things and we nver know which is going to actually happen.  I mean... I once heard that they were going to shoot a pilot for a series for that movie called "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."  Can you believe that one?  heh

<DD>Mysty Mage - What happened was Sarah wanted to hit the little pad herself when Eliza first appeared on the show and I guess it got numb after a few takes.  So (of course) in Hollywood when you are a star of a hit show people tend to over react to that.  It wasn't even bruised really, but everyone made a big deal out of it.  It was cute.  She actually wore a little sling around the set and had Sophia step in to press buttons on the TV in "Homecoming" the following week.<BR>
<BR>
Actorsare like little cute kids when it comes to those things.  Even the guys.  I just ask the stunt guys who has the most pins holding them together this week and usually the actor quiets down.  But it does make for good talk show material I guess:)</SMALL>

<BR>
Sophia just came by and she is getting a big kick out of the various costumes that you guys think Oz might wear.  All I can say is "outrageous."  I'd better leave it at that:)<BR>
<BR>
I am looking for another secret spot to stick a shout out to the PB again this season.  haven't found a place for it yet, but I'll let you know when I am able to sneak it in.

<DD>Angle Man: I'll be in the next episode (a couple of times - but you won't see my face)<BR>
gazoo - Just the usual pain for Sophia.  Lots of bruises and a sprain (so far)<BR>
<BR>
Mysty Mage - ?huh?  Sophia broke her hand doing the sword fight and just recently sprained it.  Sarah's never been hurt that I know of.<BR>
<BR>
Dki - Nope.  That's me choreographing the action and Sophia doing the Buffy fighting and stunts.<BR>
<BR>
Bri - I'm just doing Buffy right now.  There's no way that I can be across town and here at the same time.  (But my stunt guys are working on it)<BR>
<BR>
Adina - Don't worry.  I waited till we hung up before I jumped on here.

<DD>Shooting is going well.  I see that everyone saw the thing on E (or heard) so you know the costumes.  So the question for the night is:<BR>
"What is Oz?"<BR>
<BR>
I could tell you , but then I'd have to kill myself.<BR>

Just got a call from a friend in Canada who told me that Buffy just started airing in his area and he is now hooked on the show after watching "Bad Girls."  <BR>
