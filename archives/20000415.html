<DD>Okay, I actually have <BR>
to bail, but I will address a <BR>
couple of things.  The music in <BR>
Hush is Danse Macabre by <BR>
Saint-Saen and that was a <BR>
coincidence.  Spike will be <BR>
coming back next season -- and <BR>
it'll be different than this <BR>
season.  Quite different.  In <BR>
fact, many things will be.  More <BR>
than that I cannot say except <BR>
that every one of the scoobies <BR>
and surrounding regulars will <BR>
have a lot of new stuff to deal <BR>
with.  No one gets left out.  <BR>
<BR>
Ah, the vagueness.  Gotta fly.<BR>

<DD>The actress invited <BR>
Angel over when she was in his <BR>
office.  Jeez, people!  You think <BR>
we'd make some blatant mistake <BR>
like that?  Just because Angel <BR>
OCCASIONALLY can be seen <BR>
sunbathing on the show doesn't <BR>
mean we don't take our mythology <BR>
se

<DD>It's over.  Finished <BR>
shooting the last ep at 3:00 <BR>
yesterday morning.  Went to <BR>
sleep, woke up and started <BR>
talking with the writers about <BR>
what happens in season 5.  It's <BR>
never over.<BR>
<BR>
To say that the last ep is <BR>
interesting, oh, even strange, <BR>
would be to say true.<BR>
<BR>
Just wanted to wave hi.  Still <BR>
sleepy.<BR>
<BR>
Did I mention strange?<BR>
