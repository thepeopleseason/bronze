<DD>Okay, last round then I gotta go work some animated magic.<BR>
<BR>
The move to UPN and the Posting Board:  I've read that Joss is very committed to the Bronze.  I wouldn't worry too much about things changing drastically when UPN takes over.<BR>
<BR>
JustLiza: It's all true.  You Bronzers are great.  And hey, I melt whenever someone calls me Mr. DeKnight.<BR>
<BR>
Willow 4ever.  Sorry.  Willow's fate is out of my hands.  We'll all miss her after Glory explodes her head with her laser beam eyes -- oh!  You've tricked me into spilling the beans!  Why you sneaky little scamp!<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323: I am as mysterious as I am frugal.  Okay, last hint:  "...down these mean streets a man must go..." Identify who said this, and you'll at least know the genre I'm working in.<BR>
<BR>
greeneyes:  Yes, an excellent point.  Why isn't my mighty name in color? Arghhhh!  Steve smash!<BR>
<BR>
And with that outburst I must take my leave.  Best to all you wonderful Bronzers.  I'll return next Friday with more tales of wonder and excitement.<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>green blip:  Hmmm... too much time on your hands, my friend?  As for REBOOT, yeah, kinda liked it.  Especially that bizarre, dark, final season.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  Get Giles some booty?  Sure!  Right after I land some myself.  Priorities, priorities...<BR>
<BR>
BCangel: I think the animated Buffy is going to be on Fox Kids, which I believe is your basic Fox channel.  I have no idea when it'll actually start.  Probably very late in the year at the earliest.  Yes, it is geared more towards kids, so don't expect any sex or extremely dark storylines.  That being said, I think any fan of Buffy will love the show.  Heck, it's Buffy!  Writing for the animated show is quite refreshing, especially in regards to all the crazy action we can do.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323: Thanks for the kind words regarding the article.  As for my big summer project, well... one little hint:  1940.<BR>
<BR>
JAJ:  Thanks!  Hey, Brown University!  That's one of the colleges I didn't get accepted to.  Next time you're down in the dinning hall, get up on the table and yell, "We could have had Steven S. DeKnight!  Ahhhhhhhhh!"<BR>
<BR>
Lil Bit.  Funny you should ask.  In my outline for my first animated Buffy I had a muscular Xander wearing nothing but a bow tie.  Sadly, I was forced to put some clothes on him.<BR>
<BR>
Time... running... out...

<DD>bdbdb: I'm not sure about the posters and flyers you see in the background on Buffy.  I seem to recall someone mentioning that they are actual local bands.<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo: Basically writitng is writing, but there are some differences between animated and live action.  First, animated Buffy is only 30 minutes long.  Second, an animated script requires much more scene description.  If it's not in the script, chances are the artists won't draw it.  Finally, animation pays muuuuuch less than live action, plus you don't get residuals.  Of course, none of the Buffy writers are doing the animated show for the cash.  We're doing it because it's extra cool to be able to tell stories that we couldn't do on the live action show because of budget limitations.<BR>
<BR>
Ergoshakes:  Sure!  I love the writing on the West Wing, Once and Again, Gilmore Girls, and The Sopranos, just to name a few.  <BR>
<BR>
Raelynn:  Growing up in Jersey, I spent a little time in Delaware myself.  Are the winters still bleak and gray and the summers hot and humid?  Get yourself to New York or LA.  Fast! Before the pods get ya!

<DD>tiggy3323:  Wild Turkey it is!<BR>
<BR>
Raelynn:  My only advice is to never give up.  Like I said earlier, I was 33 before I got my first professional break.  Keep writing, keep working, and one day it will happen.  Oh yeah, also kind of helps to be in Los Angeles.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so I'll be around for about 45 more minutes, then I gotta go wrestle with my animated Buffy script.  Any more questions I can artfully dodge

<DD>Cosmic Bob: Rebecca Kirshner's amazing "Tough Love" is on next week.  "Spiral" is the week after.  The promo after "Intervention" combined scenes from both episodes.<BR>
<BR>
Janni:  Thanks for the link!  My knowledge of computers is pretty much confined to the "on" button.<BR>
<BR>
BCangel:  Had a great half-year on Buffy.  Loved every minute of it.  During my hiatus, I'm working on the Animated Buffy, as well as a top secret project  that I'll tell you all about at a later date.  Speaking of the animated show, I just read an episode by the incredible Jane Espenson (all bow!).  It was fantastic, of course.  The show's going to be great.<BR>
<BR>
Creep Crawley:  Yeah, I did use to watch Johnny Socko.  Loved it, along with a show called Space Giants.  I guess Iron Giant is a bit like Johnny Socko, but Iron Giant is much, much better.  Go!  Get the DVD!  You will love it!<BR>
<BR>
bdbdb: Not sure when we'll start working on Season Six.  All depends on the writers' strike.  As for which episodes we'll all be working on, I believe the first batch will be done in order of seniority.  Which means I'll be eppy 6 or 7.  Mmmm!  Sounds juicy.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323:  Some refreshing fruit juice with a splash of -- quick!  What devil's brew do I refer to in The Darkest Night interview?<BR>
<BR>
Now, if you will pardon me, I must step away for about ten minutes to return a call from my agent.  Be right back...

<DD>Xanderella: Well, today, I'm feeling around 90, but that's purely subjective.  Here, I'll let you do the math.  I was 33 when I got my first professional writing job on MTV's Undressed.  But as I've always said, mentally I'm stuck at around 14. And what the heck's a 'shipper?<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo:  How do you get an agent?  That's one of those great Catch 22's.  If you need an agent, they don't want you.  When you're successful and don't need an agent, they want you.  I can tell you how I got my first real agent.  I entered a lot of writing contests, and finally made it to the finals of The Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting.  That opened some agency doors and got me signed --albeit with a teeny tiny agency.

<DD>Third Hellgod, eh?  Let me think, have we seen the Third Hellfod yet... Oh, right!  We have!  She was standing right next to me in the unemployment line.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  But seriously, folks, all that Third Hellgod stuff will be cleared up in "Spiral".

<DD>Yo ho ho and a fine Steve DeKnight Friday to you all.  Let me start the big ball of fun rolling with yet another shamless plug.  Check out a long interview with me over at:<BR>

<BR>
More than you ever wanted to know about me.  They've also got some pics, but I don't believe they're up yet.<BR>
<BR>
So, how are the amazing Bronzers today?  And what's all this talk about the Third Hellgod?
