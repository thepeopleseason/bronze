<DD>One final post . . .<BR>
<BR>
Asanti--I didn't say I was "eviler" than Joss.  God forbid.  Though, if you've read my vampire novels (the originals) you can decide for yourself.  Only said I was evil before I'd ever heard of him, or Buffy.  Darlin'.<BR>
<BR>
Jaina -- Never spend any time surfing, I'm sad to say.  Too busy. <BR>
<BR>
Night for real all.

<DD>And now, before Jaina's topic gets me SUPER embarrassed, I'm going to sleep.  'Night all.<BR>
<BR>
Be well.

<DD>Asanti -- re: evil comment . . . which is, of course, why I love Joss and Buffy so much.

<DD>Ang & Icelord -- thanks!  *blush*<BR>
<BR>
Asanti -- darlin' I was evil LONG before I ever heard of Joss Whedon.<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen -- HeY!  Actually, LAG was probably talking about my original novel, STRANGEWOOD, due out in August, as she is my editor at Signet.

<DD>Islington -- ooh sure, but getting our X-man from point A to point B is all the fun in the world.<BR>
<BR>
Clattering -- thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Hitomi -- um, what were they?<BR>
<BR>
Whelk -- wish I had one of those!!<BR>
<BR>
Angle man -- y'know, I honestly can't remember if Nancy wrote it or I did, but there's a line where someone says to Oz "are you pondering what I'm pondering?" and Oz says something like, "if it involves something or other and cheez wiz, then no."  I like that one a lot.

<BR>
Angle Man -- God, i don't know.  Anyone?<BR>
<BR>
Rebecca Lynn -- thanks<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Ang--thanks!  oh, and check out Spike & Dru next week!<BR>
<BR>

<DD>? -- too damn busy.<BR>
<BR>
Asanti -- that's why they call it a cliffhanger.<BR>
<BR>
Ms. A -- Yup.  Until we knew the outcome of the Faith story, we didn't dare include her.<BR>
<BR>
Icelord -- thanks!

<DD>Okay, first of all, everyone go see The Matrix!<BR>
<BR>
Carita -- book 3 is Sons of Entropy.<BR>
<BR>
Horizon -- Well, i have a solo book called Sins of the Father that I love.  That'll be out in November.  The Gatekeeper trilogy is just everything and the kitchen sink.  But Child of the Hunt may be my favorite because it was the first "adult" Buffy book.<BR>
<BR>
Jaina -- great name.  We had to start way ahead of season three.  All Joss told us was that Angel was coming back.  Anyway, the books are in a sort of alternate continuity, but obviously not completely.

<BR>
St. G -- what's up?<BR>

<DD>Mabb -- Hi there.  I was only in here for a peek and maybe a drive-by, but then I just happened to notice the last quote in your tag -- I'm a big Alana Davis fan, and "32 Flavors" is one of my favorite songs right now.
