<dd>The Angel E:  Good for you!  Stay away from those nasty spoilers.  They'll ruin your dinner.<br><br>Biobabe:  Yeah, I suck.  I’ve suspected it for years.  But I’m having surround sound installed this weekend, so I’ll be able to get the full experience from your work.  Woo hoo!<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  JD?  Start pouring.  The perks with each level are more money and the power to say, "No, you stupid lab monkey, I am NOT going to do that."  Well, Joss can say that.  The rest of us just munch bananas and try to avoid the tranquilizer darts.<br><br>Kronos:  I’ll never forget our night that might have been.  Sniff sniff.  Wah wah wah.<br><br>Ergoshakes:  Don’t think you can escape my keen discerning eye.  Woo woo.<br><br>Janni:  Back hair?  I’m not even going to ask.  Seek professional help.  Quickly.  No, I really mean it.  Go.  Now.  Run.<br><br>Wolfguard:  The IRS has an even keen eye than my own.   I believe that’s their hand I feel in my pocket now.  Wait, no – Rebecca!  I told you I don’t have any candy!  Get out of there!<br><br>Newt:  A freebie?  I have no idea what that word means.  No, we are paid handsomely for our work on the animated show.  When one of us writer types is working on an ep of the live-action show, the rest of us gather to break the next story coming up.  No rest for us, baby!<br><br>SandraL:  Not sure what we’re doing for Halloween yet.  Aw, heck – I’m too tired to come up with a joke.  Somebody jump in.<br><br>midiangirl:  My first ep #6, airing on Oct. 30 here in USA.<br><br>Ripped Toast:  I play the guitar, man.  No manager here, but may join in with a blistering lead.  Well, a slightly-warm-to-the-touch lead.<br><br><br>And with that I must poof.  Put your pants back on.  Close the door quietly.  Stevie sleep now.  Mumble… mumble… nmm… nmm… ice cream… mumble mumble…<br><br>

<dd>basia:  No contest.  Ice cream.  Vanilla, please.<br><br>Cashmere.  Nope.  Just the gal, thanks.  I want for nothing else (except for time to spend with the gals).<br><br>Allyson:  Your Fury's great.  We feed him a treat every now and then, clean his cage, and give him a little water.  Fury, no!  Not my favorite shoes!  As for my goat, it was baby soft.  Like snuggling up with a warm blanket.<br><br>Angel Rain:  I don't think the WB stopping crossovers is the issue.  I think it's more a creative decision of wanting the Angel show to stand on its own. <br><br>Phoenix:  So what you're saying is, more Graham?   I hear he goes really good with some nice huckleberry jam.<br><br>huggybuff:  Mmm.  Tuna.<br><br><br><br>I smell an impending meeting coming up.  Last round, baby.<br><br>

<dd>biobabe:  I totally missed your post.  And being the evil scamp that I am, I still haven't had the chance to watch your film.  But I'm still looking forward to it.<br><br>andeeh:  I'll let you in on a little Hollywood secret:  Story Editors don't edit anything.  It's just a writing level.  You start as Staff Writer, then you move up as follows: Story Editor, Exec. Story Editor, Co-producer, Producer, Supervising Producer, Co-exec. Producer, Exec. Producer.  So Marti and Fury are and always shall be outside my evil editing grasp (not that they need this joker poking at their stuff anyway).<br><br>Cashmere: Happy B-day coming up.  This season Spike's going to -- hey, I ain't fallin' for that.  I'll need a birth certificate and three forms of picture ID before I spill any birthday secrets.<br><br>Tiggy:  Halloween brain teaser just for you: Crank the handle and stand back.  Hee hee hee...<br><br>

<dd>Well I tell you to ignore everything for me, then I ignore you.  How rude!  Bad, Steve, bad!  Sorry -- got yanked away.  I'm going to get yanked again in a second, but I promise I'll back in an hour or two.<br><br>Quick answers to some of your questions:  Yes, no, no, maybe, thanks, yes, absolutely not, and maybe (if they let me).  Hope that clears everything up.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  I'm evil, I tells ya!  Pure evil!<br><br>Special hugs to Tiggy for keeping a visual record of you rouges and scalawags (Send her your pics!  Now!) and to the mighty Boo for keeping DeKnight's Riders marching ever forward.  You guys are the best.<br><br>

<dd>OldManFan:  The writing be good.  We should start breaking 12 soon.  Yeah - I think there'll be a cast CD of the musical.<br><br>Jenkins:  I prefer my mug with whiskers, but the ladies seem to prefer me smooth.  And I always do as the ladies say.<br><br>

<dd>A fine pantsless Friday to all you Beta Bronzers.  Ignore your work.  Eschew your mate.  Forsake your children.  Talk to me instead!<br><br>I'll be in out for the next couple of hours, so my responses may be sporadic and mildly incoherent.  Hey, just like I normally am!<br><br>
