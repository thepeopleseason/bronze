<DD>Aw, man...did you have to KILL it?  I always sing the tags into submission.  Music soothes the savge breast and all that.  I hate all this violence against the poor, defenseless tags.  Bezoars, on the hand, are a different matter... ;-)

<DD><b>rage:</b>  I know this is unbelievable, but I am COMPLETELY ingnorant of any KISS songs.  There's some famous "Iwant to rock all night and party every day" song, right?  I couldn't tell you the tune, though.  My band's not big on covers...although we did do a Portishead cover...made the song just about unrecgnizable, hehe...<BR>
<b>1BuffyFan:</b>  Cool.  Did you sign up for your stickers?

<DD><b>JenniferLynn:</b>  Well, they look FABULOUS on cars, too, you know! =)  Just go to the <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">Velvet Chain Site</a> and click on the Diva Icon to sign our mailing list.  We'll send 'em on out to ya!  For FREE!<BR>
<b>?:</b>  Well, I am unashamed....I hereby vote for myself, beacuase I am the sort of person who always votes for herself!  lol...no, really.  If you don't vote for yourslef, why would you expect others to do so?  HOWEVER< let me say I sincerely hope the best STABer wins!!  We're all great, right?  Woo-hoo!  Go <b>Jade!</b>  Go <b>EverDawn!</b> =)  Oh, and yeah, I'm sure Apollo took care of the bezoar.  No problem.  I'm pretty tough, actually, so it's not a big deal.<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  Not a dumb question.  I generally keep both ears covered...but it all depends on the quality of the mix you've got soming into the headphones, whether or not your harmonizing live woth other singers in the same room, etc.

<DD><b>S.O.R.:</b>  Hi.  Well, we're working on a BUNCH of new songs, and we'll be reording a demo of them over the next few weeks.  It's cool to be doing new material. =)<BR>
<b>Missi:</b>  Nice to meet you, too!<BR>
<b>Pixie:</b>  LOL...you're so sweet!  Thank you.  Do you have our CD yet?<BR>
<b>?:</b>  Hey!  Oh, I wasn't mad about missing Seth...I just thought it would be funny to contact him via an online chat .  You know, I've tried to vote for STABer of the month, but it won't connect after I submit my vote.  *sigh*<BR>
Hi and Bye to <b>drdan</b><BR>
<b>Gregg:</b>  No worries! I can handle myslef OK.  I just didn't like the bezoar (Morganna, I think) yesterday...but <b>rage</b> is OK.  Just a musician with some very STRONG opinions as to what constitutes "art."  That's what makes a horse race, right?<BR>
