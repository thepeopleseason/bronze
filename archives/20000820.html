<DD>Happy.  Please.  Do you honestly think that the kind of venom you post will have any effect on the opinions of anyone else?<BR>
<BR>
And on that lovely note, I must go and put my sons to bed.  Let's hope we can raise them to be courteous and kind, and not Bezoars.

<DD>Happy Goat--see, I know the best thing to do in a situation like this is just keep my mouth shut . .. but I'm just not that patient with (insert expletive here).<BR>
<BR>
You "hear" Kim Newman's books are good.  Well, they are, but you wouldn't know, because you "hear" they're good, rather than having read them for yourself.<BR>
<BR>
As for my novels, do yourself a favor.  Either don't read them (no skin off my nose) and keep your mouth shut, or go and buy Strangewood or one of my original vampire novels and read it before you offer an opinion or recommendation.  Those who offer an opinion out of ignorance are generally perceived by others as ignorant.<BR>
