<dd>here's a excerpt of an email i just sent a friend:<br><br>alex is such the sweet kitty.  always thinking about me...  she just brought me a present: a live rat.  i was sound asleep and heard her come crashing through the window...  "here alex, come to sleep"  i say.  then nothing... then dottie(my dog) starts growling... so i say "stop it dottie"...  she keeps growling.... i say "leave alex alone"  then alex jumps up on the bed.. dottie growls really loud.  so i turn the light on and there sits alex, a rat in her mouth- which she just drops... "here daddy, i brought you breakfast"....  the rat runs off the bed and behind the fridge.  imagine waking up to that at 4:00 a.m.!!!  well, needless to say with the help of alex, and my machete we manage to chase it out the door nearly 20 minutes later... <br>________________<br><br>ok.. back to bed and sleep i hope.<br><br>RD<br><br>

<dd>Hey gang,<br><br>Can’t stay and talk, so save your “Sweet Drew Goddard, I bow at your knee and worship your every move-s” for another time.  Just wanted to do a quick drive-by because I’ve been thinking about it and I’ve decided that spoilers are bad.<br><br>Now, I know I’m not saying anything new here.  I’m realistic.  Let’s face it – those of you who read spoilers aren’t going to stop just because I tell you not to.  So I’ve decided to come here and make you all an offer.  Here it is:<br><br>Anyone who can remain spoiler-free for the rest of the season – all the way through the finale – will be immediately and passionately French-kissed by me.  <br><br>That’s right – I will French-kiss anyone, woman or man, who can avoid spoilers for the rest of the year.<br><br>Ho ho.  How does that sound?  May want to think twice before clicking on your spoilerslayers or your cross-and-stakes or your whatevers now, won’t you?<br><br>I mean, ol’ U. D. is gonna French-kiss the hell out of you if you’re good.  That’s a sweet deal.  I mean, it’s just five months, spoiler-free…<br><br>And seriously, I’m an awesome Frencher.  And for the rest of your life, you’ll be able to tell everyone we Frenched.  <br><br>Nice.<br><br>Now, I know I’ve been off the radar for a while, but they’ve been working us hard here in the coal-mines, so please forgive me.  As soon as I’m done working on this script, which should be next week sometime, I’ll be back for a good round of Hose Down the Slip-and-Slide (what the hell does that even mean?  Sorry – it’s late.)<br><br>But in the meantime, the offer’s on the table.  Hey – if you want to look at spoilers now, it’s up to you, but man, you’re gonna be missing out.<br><br>To my Minions, well, I love and treasure you all.  I honestly don’t tell you that enough.  You know… come to think of it… I don’t give you enough free stuff either.  In fact, let’s have some sort of contest.  Dachelle, do you want to judge a contest for me?  I’m thinking a “Praise Goddard” Contest.  The rules are as such:  the object of the contest is to praise me in the best way possible.  Entries can be in the form of a song, a poem, a sculpture, a t-shirt, a painting, an interpretative dance… really, the sky’s the limit on this, okay?  Whatever the hell you can think of.  Top three entries get a bunch of cool Buffy stuff. <br><br>We’ll figure out the logistics of it all next week (Dachelle, I’m gonna get a hold of you next week anyway – sorry it’s taken me so long.)  But in the meantime, start thinking of those entries.  <br><br>I like this contest.  It celebrates the very spirit upon which this group was founded in the first place – praise and worship of me.  Ol’ U.D.<br><br>And don’t forget about that French-kiss deal, either.   How ‘bout that?  Tonight’s turning out to be real sweet for everyone involved.  Real sweet, I tell you.<br><br>Don’t doubt the clout.<br><br>Ultimate Drew<br><br>
