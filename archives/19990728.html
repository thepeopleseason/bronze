<DD>Cleio:  Well, sorry, no gigs in Sept. because we're working on the new record all of Sept. and most of October. We might play one gig in October at House of Blues, but that's about it (until Nov.)<BR>
Hi to Charity aka, Winter Rain, and Skittery (thanks for the compliment).  Gotta run.  Another band rehearsal.  Time to blast the bass.<BR>
Take care.........

Angelus1297: yea.... You're right, I'm famous as hell.  What is it like working with the buffy gang?  Well, basically, they worship me. I can't get them to stop calling me, you know?  I think they must like musicians...<BR>
Cosmic Bob: Things are going great.  Big show for us coming up on Aug 6th at the Key Club in L.A.  The Diva of the Bronze has been on vacation.  She's back though. I'll bet she'll visit the Bronze soon.
