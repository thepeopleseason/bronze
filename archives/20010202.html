<DD><i>-mere-, still vibrating with the NNNAAAANNNNGGGGG of the garden chair, manages to snake <b>MTVA</b>'s black Flair felt tip pen away from her...<BR>
<BR>
...<u>just like she did the last one</u>...<BR>
<BR>
...and poke it into the Calvinball, deflating it.  -mere- then folds the Calvinball in four neat squares, and shoves it down <b>belmont</b>'s throat with a little peach Schnapps as a lubricant.  now that <b>belmont</b> has </i>become<i> the Calvinball, -mere- has transformed the game into <b>belmont</b>ball, and tosses <b>belmont</b> through the special Infinite Points Ring (which unfortunately disappears the moment an object passes through it), thus sealing her victory at a new sport and enshrining her in ESPN's Dork's Hall of Fame forever.</I>

<DD><b>Dunlin</b>, please let <b>Frodo</b> into the hammock.<BR>
<BR>
<small>and oh, the very odd things we have occasion to say around here.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Corpelia</b>: you still have the WAW?  COOL!  'cause i don't!  could you send it to me?  i'm a little hesitant to post my e- addy, but you should still have it, and if not, ask one of the oldbies.  i'd love to see that again!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Circe</b>: yes, i turned on my computer this morning while getting ready for work, and saw your e-.  and did i really lock myself in the basement?  i vaguely recall that, although  i definitely remember not being able to type the J-word after B2.  sometimes i still find myself making little "meep!" <small>[not MeeB]</small> sounds when Joss walks into the room.  i figure a couple more years and i might actually be able to form a complete sentence when he's around.  like, "i really admire the quality and depth of your MEEP!"<BR>
<BR>
<b>President Blade Sir</b>: um, can i have your abs and chest on MY menu, too?<BR>
<BR>
<small>"Hello, salty goodness!"</small><BR>
