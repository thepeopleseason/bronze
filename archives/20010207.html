<DD>Just wanted to say thanks one more time to everyone before I sign off and get back to work on more Buffy magic.  You guys are the best.  See you at the PBP.

<DD>Okay, in no particular order:<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I am indeed weevil.  But I don't fall down (much).<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I will be at the PBP.  Wouldn't miss it.  You glorious fans are what keep us going -- well, that and all the free candy. <BR>
<BR>
Yes, I was a huge fan of BTVS before I was hired to write "Blood Ties".  I was actually a fan even before I became a professional writer.  Watched every episode and dreamed of what it'd be like to work on such an incredible show.  Then I got hired on and oh let me tell you -- it's a zillion times better than I could ever have imagined.  Everyone is so talented and funny and generous.  It's amazing.<BR>
<BR>
I'd like to take a minute to thank the cast and crew that brought "Blood Ties" to such vivid life.  Sarah and Michelle's performances were gut-wrenching, even to the guy that wrote the script.  And everyone else was equally amazing: Nicholas, Anthony, Alyson, Amber, James, Emma, Kristine, Clare, and Charlie -- big, gooey thanks for making my first episode so memorable.  Also a huge thanks to the director, Michael Gershman.  His talent is only surpassed by his kindness.

<DD>AngelRachel: Yes, the snuggle scene between Willow and Tara was cut (along with other bits and pieces) because the episode was running about two minutes long. <BR>
<BR>
Cashmere & Swoop: Thank you both very much.  I'm blushing.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson: Gin?  Shudder!  Never touch the stuff.  Not since that unfortunate incident in high school involving the toilet and my big fat stupid head. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone: Sorry I can't send a personal response to everyone.  I'm at the office right now and kind of juggling the PB and, you know, the sweet funky Buffy magic. I can say this about Xander's role in the big finale: my lips are sealed.  Come on, I just got this job.  Kinda like to keep it.

<DD>OzLady: Yes, you are correct.  Having grown up on the East Coast, I can confirm that it is far, far too cold to assume the guise of Mr. King -- at least during this time of year.<BR>
<BR>
Liza Da Newbie: You are also correct.  Green is the color of the key, isn't it?

<DD>Steve DeKnight -- if that really is his name -- would like to thank eveyone for their generous comments regarding "Blood Ties".  There's also a nasty rumor going around that he'll be writing one more episode this season -- if he doesn't unexpectedly morph into Joss or Stephen King.
