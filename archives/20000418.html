<b>Carita:</b>  Glad to hear it!<BR>
<b>wiccachick:</b>  Why, thank you!  You can always order any of our CDs (and other goodies as well) directly from our site, btw.  Secured credit card transaction.  Just FYI.  The day job is just fine.  Tiring, but fine.<BR>
<b>Andy:</b>  No, no...I'm just the singer of a band.  REally nobody very important.  We were on the show very early on, and we're on the soundtrack, and I post a lot, and that's about it.  =)<BR>
<b>W-Sky:</b>  Hi!<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  Je vais bien, merci.  Un peu fatiguee, mais c'est normale.<BR>
<b>Slayergrl99:</b>  Nope, niot yet.  Right now it's ONLY availble at out website.  But it's totally a good deal, and it's a secure site!  =)  Go here:  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>

<b>Little Willow:</b>  Hey!  Actually, no, it does NOT include shipping.  And it's NOT $12.50, it's $12.95  The new CD cost us more to make, so we had to raise the price on that one.  Including shipping, the new CD costs $14 within the United States.  =)  You go, you selling fool!  hehehe<BR>
