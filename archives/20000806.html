<DD>Posting in my sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Just wanted to answer: toning down my involvement?  Well, i'm only shooting three Buffy's this year (last year, four) but that's so I can be MORE involved in the eps I don't shoot.  (Most EP's don't shoot much at all so they can run the show better.)  I will take the odd hour off (I went to Chicago, after all) but on the other hand I want to hit 100 at full speed.  Now I want (I really really want) to be in bed.  No more intriguing questions, you bastard-people!ZZZZZing...

<DD>You know, in Victorian society people would have been polite enough to IGNORE the fact that I can't remember the damn color codes.   (Of course, in Victorian society I couldn't have all those wibes.  Plus I'd probably have a big funky-ass mustache and opinions about steam.  It's a trade off.)  g'nite already.

<DD>A quick check in before bed, fun to see some B/A discussion, a message from Slavey and the exciting news that a voluptuous college girl wants be my wibe!  Very nice for a Sunday night.  Well, I gotta be up early tomorrow to watch them film the pivotal scene where Buffy, Dawn, Giles, Willow and Tara all do a thing.

<DD>Just to say, just loked at the Amberview -- cool one is she.  At the con, a woman came up to me after the panel to say "Thank you for Tara".  But I was being herded away and I didn't get to respond, I shouted "You're Welcome" but I don't know if she heard, anyway it was a big deal for me that she came up to say that and I hope she knows it.  Amber and I chat on occasion about the greatness of helping people with this role.<BR>
<BR>
And I stopped by the site wherein I'm a hottie and, oddly enough, I approve of it wholeheartedly.  What are the odds?

<DD>I just read about Sir Alec Guinness dying.  I'm really sad to hear that.  My favorite of all the Sirs, the best and most subtle actor the brits ever gave to the movies.  Tunes of Glory, Bridge on the River Kwai, Kind Hearts and Coronets, the Horse's Mouth... He was the man.  Well, he lived long and did well, can't ask for more, except being made a Sir which none of us can ask for anyway thanks to our pesky republic.  <BR>
<BR>
I've an ANGEL needs working on, so off go me.  Have good nights.

<DD>just a quick 'hey' to say that the Wizardcon was cool and everyone was very nice and all that.  Plus reading all that interseting stuff about naming things in RESTLESS -- I never thought of that stuff, but it's definitely true.  Neat.  I love surprises, especially when they're in my own work.  Anyway, Con fun, plus hangage with Karl Moline, who's drawing FRAY and is a talent-man.

The caves were a set.  fun to shoot in.  most of it was shot with steadicam.  pain in the arse for Herb to light though.  but i think he loves a challenge - and he made it look great.
