<DD>Just on the net doing some late night research.  Thought I'd stop by on my way to comfy warm dreamland.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Joss and Marti are treating us all very well.  Why, I'd work for them for free (but don't tell them that -- they might get sinister ideas).

<DD>Shadow:  Yeah, we crusty VIP types pretty much pop up unexpected.  Look!  There goes one now!

<DD>Sorry guys.  Meeting ran long, and now I'm off to another one.  I'll try to stop back later, but if I don't make it, have a great weekend.  I'll stop by again soon.<BR>

<DD>Creep Crawley:  Many movies have made me feel that way.  Brazil, The Matrix, Blood Simple.  The list is a very long one.<BR>
<BR>
Rob:  Sure.  I'll be in touch as soon as I get the chance.<BR>
<BR>
Teen AK:  I play the noble writer.  You'll have to look real close or you'll miss me.<BR>
<BR>
Writing jobs on the animated show?  Beats me.  I suppose they'll have to have somebody write it.<BR>
<BR>
Kill Faith?  Over my dead body!<BR>
<BR>
Isis:  How the heck did you find out the title of my episode?  You guys got spies under my desk?  As for the UK party in August, I am easily tempted.  If we're on strike and I'm not working, I might just drop by.<BR>
<BR>
Am I Nicholas Bendon?  I wish!<BR>
<BR>
Uhp!  Got to go into a top secret meeting.  I'll be back as soon as I'm done.

<DD>Okay, let me see if I can remember all your questions.<BR>
<BR>
Is Marc Blucas coming back?  Beats me.  Sounds like a cool idea, though.<BR>
<BR>
Were any BTVS fans involved in that tragic Aspen plane crash?  Not to my knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
Can I give you any spoilers?  Yeah, right after I file for unemployment.<BR>
<BR>
Will I be making any cameos on Buffy?  Now that's a fine idea.  I think Fury and I should do a little demon action in the future.  I'll get my agents right on that.<BR>
<BR>
Are we going to do a musical episode of Buffy?  You're asking the wrong guy.  The only thing worse than my dancing is my singing.<BR>
<BR>
Is the amazing Mr. Kane going to die on Angel?  Uh... I work on Buffy.<BR>
<BR>
Why doesn't my name appear in blue?  Excellent question.  Who should we talk to?  I've always dreamed of being blue.

<DD>Lisa H:  Life couldn't get much better.  Heck, I'm on Buffy!  I spring out of bed every morning and can't wait to get to work.  Very unnatural.<BR>
<BR>
Have we finished filming yet?  No.  We're finishing up ep. 21 (written by the astounding Doug Petrie) and will begin the finale sometime next week.<BR>
<BR>
What have I heard about the animated show?  Plenty!  It's going to be great.  I've seen some artwork for it and it blew me away.  Plus it's being headed by Jeph Loeb.  Those who read comics will know him form Batman's Long Halloween and Dark Victory, as well as his work in Superman.  Great guy, great talent.  This show should rock!

<SMALL>(Fri Mar 30 10:05:58 2001 216.186.167.165)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>And a fine good morning to you folks too.  Can't go back to bed -- Rust Never Sleeps, and neither do I.<BR>
<BR>
How long does it take to write a first draft?  Generally five days, although in a pinch we have been known to squirt one out in three.<BR>
<BR>
I read somebody asking when new shows will air.  I believe in a little less than three weeks.  Mid April?<BR>
<BR>
And speaking of new shows, I recently read Joss' amazing season finale (epidose 100!).  It's everything you could hope for.  Right on par with the Season Two ender.  I can't wait to see it.

<DD>Yo ho ho, bright and early Buffy fans.  Thought I'd mix things up and appear in the AM this time around.  <BR>
<BR>
I spy Lisa H dancing around.  How's school treating you?
