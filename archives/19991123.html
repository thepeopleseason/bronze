All right.  We've had our fun.  A little history.  A little filthy sex talk.  A lot of Syphillis.<BR>
<BR>
And thus... goodnight!<BR>
<BR>
Keep watching everybody... doesn't next week look great?

Also, the attempted rebellion at the Santa Barbara mission, with the Chumash leaders being hanged as a result -- that really happened.  As did the accused Chumash thieves having their ears cut off.    I actually did a bunch of research  before we even broke the story, so we'd know what we had to work with.

<BR>
But first, Erika, the song rocks.  Had to be on the CD.  Jane, thanks for the credit, a little something about my sexual prowess or my stellar golf game woundn't KILL YOU, but thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Somebody mentioned comic books.<BR>
<BR>
All the ABC comicx by alan Moore are phenom.  Preacher, Earth X, Astro City, White Out, Ball and Chain, Children of the Atom, plus some i'm forgetting.  It's a renaissance in comic land.  good time to be alive.<BR>
<BR>
I'm leaving.  Nobody try to follow me!

<DD><b>Megdalen:</b>  Cool!  May I ask you, what are the call-letters of the station, (you know:  WABC, WXYZ, that sort of thing), please?  I would really like to get in touch with them.  (Hmmmmmm...phone interview, perhaps?)<BR>
<b>DoBoy:</b>  Hmmmmmmmm...call the stations up there, get them to keep playing us, make us famous, so we get tour-support (translation: CASH), to be able to trek over there and play for you guys!!!!<BR>

Mallory, I believe, asked about the Indian tribe mentioned in today's ep.  They were the Chumash, who  lived in much of Southern California.  The last full-blooded Chumash Indian died in 1952, although there is an active community of partial Chumash descendants.<BR>
They lived what is thought to have been a relatively peaceful life, harvesting fish and acorns.  Lots and lots of acorns.  They died by the tens of thousands in Spanish missions.  It's all very sad.  I did a lot of research, and YIKES.

<DD>Who're you calling Ty?  My point is, i had to jump back to clear it up:  Buffy doesn't remember what happened.  She absolutely posatively definitely never ever will.  Unless there's a story in it.  Jane, feel free to slump and rest on your hilarious laurels.  We were right:  Syphillus is ALWAYS funny.   <BR>

Wow.  Never posted at the same time as Joss before.  And of course, as I've explained many times, and I'm sure you all now, Joss is very much the creative force behind all the eps.<BR>
<BR>
Huge chucks of Pangs were actually written by him.  Including esp. the Willow/Giles argument and other good stuff.

<DD>And so to bed -- or, two rewrites and then bed.  Grumble grumble...  Oh, and listen to the words of Jane on pitching.  She has used her mind-control methods on me many times, i am her powerless slave which pretty much sucks except I get every other thursday off.  I'm so far gone.

Scribe:  that is so cool, the pitch at Voyager.  Tips to bring it home:  be flexible, pay attention to what they're responding to.  If they start saying "what about..."  nod and follow their lead.   Let them start shaping the ep.  Then they start to feel propietary and then you have a sale.

Cool trivia?  "Hus"  (or variantly "Khus") is the Chumash word for "Bear."  This means that if they had bothered to look that up, they might have anticipated the big morph.  Interesting, huh?

<DD>Just a quick drive-by to say I thought the crossover was GREAT, and I even <i>cried</i>, which I almost never do, but I guess I'm just a sappy romantic at heart, and the whole thing just got to me.  OH!  And...<BR>

I thought the final cut in the first half (the ending shot of the Buffy episode, I should say), was so funny, I actually was laughing out loud, like a freakin' maniac, all by myself in my apartment.  Did anybody else catch the look on Spike's face, in particular??  Priceless!<BR>

Hi all!  Just dropping to say thanks for all the great comments I'm reading here about "Pangs."<BR>
I understand that the big Angel ep was much more emotional and involving -- in fact I'm kinda amazed anyone's talking about mine at all!
