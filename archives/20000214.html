<DD><b>Misako:</b>  Let me be clear:  I think she's lovely, and her English is excellent, it's just her accent combined with poor enunciation that creates the difficulty.  =)  And I thought David's dance was hilarious.<BR>
<b>indiekid:</b>  Nice to meet you, and lol about the math class!<BR>
<b>Big Tony:</b>  Hehehehe...=)<BR>
<b>Tai-Chi:</b> Cool!  Glad you like the Buffy-lyrics...they're supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.  (You know...kinda funny ina geeky way?)  Do you have "Warm" yet?  Just curious.<BR>
<b>Motorclycle au pair Boy:</b>  So I have gathered!  lol  What a bunch  Can't wait to meet a few of them at the PBP!<BR>
<BR>
OK, I'm leaving...don't want to trigger a new migraine!  ACK!  =)  See you later!<BR>

<DD><b>chi:</b>  Nope, I didn't.  Been working on the new CD and stuff, but our first gig since the Troubadour in January  will be the PBP this Saturday!  The Amatomobile is in the shop.  The insurance adjuster is just getting around to looking at the darn thing today.  Will probably be a couple weeks til I get it back.  *sigh*  And no, I don't crave sweets particularly after a migraine, but I <i>always</i> crave them...and salty things!  )I love to eat...)<BR>
<b>Misako:</b>  No!  Would you believe I never got around to seeing it?  I'll rent it soon.  She is a funny girl!<BR>
<b>buggo:</b>  Ick!  Well, feel better, and you're welcome!<BR>
<BR>
Getting ready to go...

<DD><b>Motorcycle au pair Boy</b>:  Friendly-hello back to you!  Probably not anytime soon, but we can hope!  =)<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  Yay!  See you then!<BR>
<b>Lady Wolfsbane:</b>  I <i>LOVED</i> the Angel-boogie dance!!!  =)<BR>
<b>Slave2Faith:</b>  Hi and bye!  =)<BR>
<b>Yooper:</b>  Yeah, they really really suck.  I had to use an Imitrex injection for this one.  <i>REALLY</i> bad.  =(  Thanks for the no-migraine wishes, and see you Saturday!

<DD>I just wanted to chime in and add my whole-hearted agreement on the Bai-Ling mumbling thing.  It was VERY difficult for me to understand her...I found I kept turning the volume on my TV up and up and up...and I am someone who had no problem understand the accents in <i>Trainspotting</i>!  ;-)  Also, I agree that Angel seems to have more natural chemistry with Kate than with Bai Ling, but maybe they can work on that.  AND I still think Wesley is far too bumbling.  Please, please let him get a clue!  IMHO<BR>
<BR>
How is everyone?  Looking forward to this weekend?  I had an EVIL migraine yesterday, and am still not 100%, so I probably won't be on the board for long.
