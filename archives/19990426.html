Jeff Stacy and I just wanted to let you know that we have NOT forgotten about the autographed photo we promised you guys.  We've just been held up a bit.  The picture we were planning on using isn't duplicating very well in col<i></i>or, so we're trying black and white, but we're not sure that's going to work either, etc.  So, please bear with us...your pics will be sent out soon, I promise!  =)<BR>

I've recently been contacted by Fox regarding the upcoming Buffy Soundtrack.  Apparently TVT is considering putting one or two score pieces on it, and they asked me (through Fox) to submit possible selections for inclusion.<BR>
<BR>
I mention this only because up until this point I have always been told there was no chance of there being any score on the CD.  I wouldn't want to take anything away from Velvet Chain or Darling Violetta or Four Star Mary, all of whom in my opinion deserve a place on the CD, not to mention any number of the other Bronze bands.  But if you want a score piece or two on the CD, now that I know it's a real possibility, I just wanted to ask those of you who are writing letters to TVT to add score to your list of requests.  I'll need all the support I can get.<BR>
<BR>
If they give me one track, it will probably be some newly-recorded version of the B/A love theme.  If they give me two, I'll probably push for the ending bit from "The Wish" as a second track.<BR>
<BR>
I also mention this because it means the final lineup is far from being set in stone.  The list that was floating around a couple of weeks back seems quite tentative at this point.  That is good news not only for me but also for the other Bronze bands who at this point have been left off the list.<BR>

Here again is the address:<BR>
