<DD>TaraAnyaKate4Eva, you seem kind of at loose ends.  you ought to think about starting a club or something.  You may not be into that, just a thought.

<DD>I was debating whether or not to go off on a little SURVIVOR diatribe re: the merits of setting people against each other and voting them off of things when I see that I myself have been voted off of the bronze.  Well, ordinarily that would shut me up so's it didn't seem like I was just being pouty, and anyway I don't mean to ruin th' fun, but what about that whole process is cool at all?  Backstabbing and namecalling... am I very old and wrinkly that I don't think that's a hoot?  Or is it my use of the word "hoot" that makes me seem old?  Hmmm.

<DD>Hello to the Kristen.<BR>
<BR>
The comic book is called FRAY.<BR>
<BR>
The slayer girl is Melaka Fray, and yes, she uses a pointy stick -- but a cool one!  You'll see!

<DD>Yes, Eliza has said she'll come back if the stories are interesting.  Which is just too damn bad, 'cause I had some really DULL stuff lined up for Faith.  Man, QUALITY dull.  She was gonna knit, there was whole psoriasis arc, intense dandruff -- Oh!  She was gonna vaccuum.  But, like, obsessively.  It's the kind of lifeless TV the fans demand, but apparantly Little Miss Contrary isn't into that.  Well, fine.<BR>
<BR>
(Actually, Eliza will be back pretty much dependent on her film schedule.  We love her, but we're -sob- not the only ones.  Go figure.)

<DD>I don't think the comic is going to be particularly scary, though I'd like to get some creepy in there.  Mostly it's rollicking sci-fi adventure, a plucky gal in trouble and FLYING CARS, honestly is there anytihng finer?

<DD>I don't know when the comic is coming out, probably near the new year.  It's a new medium for me so I'm writing kind of slow.  And I don't know about Sydney, though I'd love to if I could.

<DD>soon to be leaving but no, I haven't been to a highschool reunion since BUFFY, would be fun, but not in a vengeance way.  There's nobody from school I particularly resent or who picked on me.  I'm not with the hate.  I was just kind of lonesome and not too popular.  And short.  Little tiny man.

<DD>Another colorless drop-in from the me.  It's saturday night, kids, and you know what that means:  I'm working.  FUN!  Actually, fun, because i'm working on the comic.  I just got the first penciled pages for issue #1 and there was much rejoicing.  The Artist is Karl Moline, deep with the talent.  Now I am as happy as a little girl.  Speaking of little girls (or voluptuous college girls, which is different, and pretty much better, unless you're maurice chevalier, any chance this segue will end some time today?) a little holler out to KIBA RIKA:  thanks for answering Kai's e-mail.  I showed her the site and she had the great fun.  (I had to explain about you being my wibe, but she could see how in lobe we were and said it was fine.  Big of her, really).  So thanks.  Increase of fun caused by you.  (If anybody sees Kiba, could they direct her to this post?  Danke.)
