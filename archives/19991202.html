<DD>Eric: Helloo! 	<BR>
<BR>
SG99: Nice to meet you! Yes, it was me and the rest of Darling Violetta.<BR>
<BR>
Sami: Thanks for being honest...now go away! *g* (kidding!) That happens to me all the time with bands. I'll hate them at first and then become a huge fan.<BR>
<BR>
SlayedMyself: Thanks much. That cello does do the trick!<BR>
<BR>
WW: Heya! Hope all's well. I'll keep my eyes on the mail. We should have the CD's on hand very soon.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Angus: Thanks, I don't know what to say. That's quite good company.<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Will keep y'all "in the loop".<BR>
<BR>
banana: It's that busy time of year, y'know! Gotta make time to see some movies, though.<BR>
<BR>
ozo: Kewl! I haven't been able to keep up with my hockey this year (other than the occasional visit to NHL.com). Hopefully, there'll be an Angel soundtrack at some point.</vgreen>

<DD>ozo: Actually, the Angel theme is not commercially available and <i>I</i> can't legally direct you to it on the 'net (it's owned by Fox like everything else Buffy/Angel) but it's not hard to find and I'm sure some nice Bronzer will direct you. *g*<BR>
<BR>
Alaric: Nice to meet you, too.<BR>
<BR>
KAM: Didn't see ya here (I scroll badly)! Feb. 2000 is shaping up to be a great month ;)<BR>
<BR>
Carita: Good save! Patrick Roy like!<BR>
<BR>
Tamz: Hi there! I'm the world's worst typist so I'm usually way behind myself.<BR>
<BR>
slay me: Nice to formally meet ya! Thanks for the kudos.<BR>
<BR>
banana: Been good (busy) doing this and that. How're you?<BR>
<BR>
Happy Birthday Werewolf!<BR>
<BR>
artemis: Why thank you and consider this an official intro!<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Good. Busy with band stuff (more info soon) and the theme you hear is the theme that there is. All 50 seconds of it!</vgreen>
