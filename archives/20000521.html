<DD>Well, a bunch of you have asked some pretty interesting questions, so I'm going to bed.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks few th' kindnesswords.  I'll be in th' touch.<BR>
<BR>
(-- dreaming of sugar plums and candy canes and Darklady and Kristen and -- what the Hell?  How did you get in here?  This is a FAMILY dream, dammit!  Go on.  And take the feather boa -- no!  I don't want -- what am gonna do with -- all right, leave the boa.)<BR>
<BR>
Bye now.<BR>
<BR>
no longer present, but entirely still me.

<DD>What, you didn't think I was gonna see what people thought?  I'd just post something deep and ride off without a backwards glance?  Please.  I'm not THAT cool.  Maybe Fury is, but not me.  <BR>
<BR>
Actually, I WAS going to slip away but having scrolled a bit, I couldn't disappear without saying THREE YEARS! to Little Willow.  And take a moment for the coolness. <BR>
<BR>
And by the way, BeMu, I keep wanting to post to you -- I YEARN to post to you -- but I keep reading that I HATE you on your posts.  Now I'm WICKED smart and I'm sure I wouldn't hate you without a very good reason.  So, don't expect me to acknowldege your existence any time soon, since there's obviously something wrong and possibly evil about you.<BR>
<BR>
And Melody, I wasn't singling you out for scolding.  I have no idea how you got the clip -- it's the system whereby you can that I was lamenting -- but I don't fault you for posting it.  I'm sure I'd've done the same.  You seem to be taking it on the chin abit lately (haven't scrolled enuf to know why) and I didn't want to add to your trubs.<BR>
<BR>
still me.

<DD>Well.  Hey.  <BR>
<BR>
This "internet" you kids have nowadays sure is wacky.  All kinds of crazy fun.  And not all of it fun!<BR>
<BR>
I've seen all kinds of things in the past few days.  This board's become a pretty intense place.  I don't plan to stay long, but I wanted to share my general observation that things do tend to get out of hand.  First there was the unfortunate incident, which I am obviously not going to talk about except this once to say I haven't been carrying on any public feud and I certainly haven't been posting under an assumed name.  There seems to be some confusion there.  I've not posted since that day, thought I have lurked a bit.  (That's how I was able to reach Justin, who kindly put Sophia back in color and gave me the color codes, for which I'm grateful unless they don't work in which case DAMN YOU, Justin!!!  Damn you to HELL!!!)  I've also seen other things that disturbed me a bit -- information about upcoming eps and such that is painfully detailed.  Some of it well-protected by spoilers, some of it not, but none of it the sort of thing that should be leaked.  Some of you may know the value I place on surprise, an element that seems nearly impossible to maintain these days.  A casting memo, a huge audio clip, a complete rundown of RESTLESS... yikes.  It saddens me a bit.  In addition to all that, I see people having a hard time knowing how to behave, veering from flaming rage to desperately cautious oversensitivity.  All of these things are connected simply by the fact that the internet (and particularly the Bronze) are new societies, still forming, and the rules, the boundries, are still unclear.  Feels a bit like the end of the STAND, when the police are asking to be armed and they wonder if the new society will be any better -- or any DIFFERENT -- from the old.  Well, this one will be different.  Privacy and propriety are going to become very tricky issues here.  I don't really have any brilliant conclusion (I'm on vacation and the only brilliant thing I can make is my grilled cheese sandwich), and I'm certainly not here to say "Don't do the following!", or "Behave this way!"  I just want to say that it's hard.  It's certainly taken a toll on you guys this past week, and I actually think you've been compassionate and very cool about it.  It used to be simpler, but now this community has grown to the point where laws start to be made.  Personally, I feel like we have way too many and not nearly enough, depending on the day of the week.  But it's a good community -- a lot of you have posted things that I love -- and I'm not referring to the PRAISE, love the PRAISE, but that's not what I mean here -- things that made me think, reassess, laugh, plot the untimely death of Fury, all kinds of stuff.  And I know it's a blast for the writers and others to talk to you guys and get the PRAISE and joke around -- none of us could have had that contact without this, and we treasure it.  It's just that there is a dark side to it, and it showed up with a vengeance.  I probably won't be around so much for a while, but I'll be lurking, and I'll definitely check in to see what you all thought of RESTLESS.  I'm really proud of it, which is something I forgot in the midst of all this.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Longwinded, vague and not at all witty -- for once I actually HOPE someone thinks it's not really me.  But it is.  Tired me.  Be well, guys.  Go easy on each other.<BR>
<BR>
me.
