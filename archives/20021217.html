<dd>Whew!!  Just had to leave the desk for a quick chat with Joss... I know you guys don't need to hear that, it doesn't matter in any way to my posts, but I just like getting to tell people that I chat with Joss.  Okay, my sweeties... I know I didn't get to all of you, but I must return to the land of Actual Buffy Filming... stay well till next time, we'll talk more.  Miss you all.<br><br>

<dd>Melusine: Now, let’s be clear… I was referring to the whole not-wanting-to-be-spoiled thing.  Though I did find the insults, you know… compelling.<br><br>Thanks MaxxMarc: I wonder what you’ll think of the episode once it’s actually filmed!<br><br>Little E: I’m standing on my head and whistling right now. Anything to avoid singing.  No seriously.  I am.  Ask Drew Goddard.<br><br>Sassyeggs: Ben and Glory?  Connected somehow? What are you getting at?  And, yes, your hair is too long. <br><br>Shylock: What?  You’re lusting?<br><br>Thanks, BuffyX.  I’ll take all the cheap compliments I can get.<br><br>Eric:  Gracious!  But I can’t give THAT away… what will I WEAR to the PBP???  (And I like pineapple, light cheese.)<br><br>Fraz… Errr, how do you feel about TWO black eyes?  <br><br>General note to everyone in the Assless Chaps Camp:  Just.  Make.  It.  Stop.<br><br>Newt: Glad you enjoy.  And pronouns are for wimps anyway, you rock.<br><br>Hey, messalina!<br><br>Hey, Brad!!  Hey Halfrek!!<br><br>

<dd>Paks: You rock.  I like the Frozen-Moment-in-Time thing, anyway.  <br><br>Dogmeat: Awwwww.  Cute.  Now, errrr… is there kiss-juice on my face?  <br><br>Rina: When will Spike be able to make his own choices free of the influence of outside forces?  Well, I mean… never.  The writers will control him forever.<br><br>The Great One:  Are you kidding??  Am I gonna see The Two Towers???  Wed. morning of course!!!!<br><br>Fraz: I’m not sure of the date of 13… we’re not planning a specific Valentine’s themed ep this year, though… though it is romantic in its own twisted, Buffy-ish way.  Depending on your definition of “romantic,” of course… And I may not be talking about Buffy and Spike…<br><br>Sassyeggs: Damn!!  You know about the Surprise Squash Ending!!  That it’s been the SQUASH controlling the asparagus all along!!  I HATE spoilers!  Now I have to go change everything…<br><br>P. Choisseul: I’m definitely NOT directing!!  That’s a dangerous, dangerous prospect… I might as well SING.  ON CAMERA!  <br><br>Molly: See, you’re doing the smart thing.  Moderation.  Not mixing.  Good girl.<br><br>Melusine, Littlexander: YOU GUYS SAVED MY LIFE!!  <br><br>Sera: Hey!  I WISH I knew the answers to those questions… I got school loans to pay off!!  But, no, we don’t know yet, we’re just trying to plan for all contingencies…<br><br>Okay,  one more round, then I’m braving the rain to go to the set.  ‘Cause I’m brave like that.<br><br>

<dd>Dogtrot: the bwa ha ha was definitely implied.<br><br>Elreyn24: The writers?  Cameos? ON CAMERA??  Believe me, no one wants to see me on camera.  I don’t think they make a lens strong enough.  (Addendum to Littlexander: I keep trying to get Marti to sing just here around the office, ‘cause SHE rocks… I would love to see another Paring Ticket Lady story…)<br><br>OMF: Our asparagus will wear a beret.<br><br>Hey, numba1!<br><br>Melusine: Now, see, THAT’S the attitude that wins BIG BIG BIG points with me… you just made my day.<br><br>P. Choisseul: Awww, poor thing, I’m so here for you.  Lots of warmth… you know, it rained for a few minutes here in LA today.  And I think it dipped to a deadening 58 degrees.  So, I feel your pain.  <br><br>BuffyX: I should BE so lucky to be Drew Goddard!  I WISH!!  All those minions!  And the talent thing, too, of course…<br><br>

<dd>Corsa: I can’t wait for the PBP.  I mean, I only have two months to pick out the outfit, so I’m a little panicked, but I’m all a-quivery about it.  Plus… there may be dance moves.  All’s I’m sayin’.<br><br>Hey, Christopher M.: Yeah, Jane and Rebecca and I are very much looking forward to the Succubus Club interview… Kitty promised me pie.  And, oh… right.  Talking and stuff.<br><br>Ceirdwyn: I wonder how much is enough?<br><br>XanFan32: Ummm… right.  Smackdown is… uhhh… oh, darn it.  I can’t hide anymore, people, you have to know who I really am: I LOVE SMACKDOWN!!  Oh, man, it’s like I‘ve never seen the sky before...<br><br>Hey Princessfantastico, dachelle!<br><br>Puckles:  Mmmm… killer cheetos…<br><br>Tiggy: Cliches go over like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs!<br><br>Melusine: Saying you loved my episodes will definitely count as “nice.”  Unless, of course, you take into account my thing about losing all respect for anyone who praises me… but I’m working on keeping that in check…!<br><br>

<dd>Dogtrot: We like to think anything COULD happen.  Including, and not limited to, a special appearance by Judge Amy Gray.  Perhaps I’ve said too much.  We do know what the end will be, and we know a lot of the points along the way, too, but, like every season, it’s the filling in of the blanks that keeps us coming back to work every day – lots of details to put in.  But in terms of the outcome you’re asking about – yup, we know it.  Except me.  Joss knows I’m pretty easily bought off – one Hershey’s bar and a Dr. Pepper, I’m singin’.  Okay, that’s not true.  I actually know.  But I do like hershey’s bars.<br><br>Blackaddergirl: I know, scheduling happens at the network level, we have little control over it.  We pretty much know when a new ep will be on when we hear the circus music indicating an exciting and rollicking new UPN promo telling us about it!<br><br>Hey, kathypg and ziquam!<br><br>Algerina… OK, now I’m thirsty.<br><br>

<dd>Hello, The Great One!<br><br>Keyser: I know, the cranberry thing can strike at ANY moment.  It’s not just for urinary tract infections anymore!!  Balance GOLD bars, on the other hand… <br><br>LenS: Oh, we TOTALLY trash the evil celebrity writer types.  I mean, they think they can just come on here whenever they want, start interrupting conversations, get people to just say all these nice things, the very AUDACITY of it, the NERVE, I wish I could let these evil writer types know just what we think of them and their… hmmm?  What?  Oh.  We speak nicely to them.<br><br>XanFan32: Oh, man, moral dilemma.  Enterprise is part of the UPN family.  Ummmm… that dog sure is cute!<br><br>Hey, CarrotSlayer, thanks!<br><br>Hey, Wolfguard!<br><br>Strangestgirl: My next ep is 13.  Shooting now.  Five words: Killer.  Asparagus.  On.  The.  Loose.<br><br>

<dd>OldManFan:  Thanks… Jane and Rebecca and I are actually trying to work it out so we can reschedule our round table discussion soon, once we clear the decks of our respective eps.  Or, maybe we’ll just have a Round Table discussion.  About pizza.<br><br>Nikka: What’s this about fury’s stack??  I thought this was a family board… I mean, yes, I would love to contribute to the PBP auction, a worthy cause indeed.  Get me the info here at the office.  I have some gym socks here that might fetch QUITE a hefty sum…<br><br>Hi LittleXander!<br><br>CarpeDi: It’s hard to top the Balance GOLD bars and cranberry juice combo when you’re looking for excitement… I saw Nemesis this weekend… oh, wait, we’re looking for things that are EXCITING.  Not CRAPTASTICULAR.  Then, no.  (Whoa, unprovoked Trek-Slam… what got into me??)<br><br>

<dd>Hello, Fan Community!  I'm here in the Buffy office getting blasted on Balance GOLD bars and cranberry juice (NOT a compatible mix, it turns out) -- had a few minutes before I had to run down to the set (we're shooting Episode 13, it's a VERY exciting week for me), so I thought I would pop in and wave hello.  Hello!<br><br>
