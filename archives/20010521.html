<DD>Kristen:  You so rock.  Most of industry friends called and said that was their favorite ad.  Great job.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella: Aw, shucks.  I give Joss all the credit for handing me such an over-the-top action eppy.  Why if that man weren't already married...<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  Actually not wearing a shirt or pants today.  Ah, what a cool refreshing breeze.<BR>
<BR>
Paks:  Sorry I missed you too.  Hello!<BR>
<BR>
Amberlynne:  More evil than you know.  Bwahaha.<BR>
<BR>
Special thanks to Tiggy3323 for putting the pic site together.  Send her your pics so I can recognize you when you start stalking me!<BR>
<BR>
Okay, gotta run.  I'm packing up to move my monkey butt out of the Valley.  Hugs and Pokes all around.<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>Sweet fancy Bronzers of the "Give Buffy an Emmy" ilk: <BR>
<BR>
Thank you all so much for the ad you placed in the Hollywood Reporter today.  Extra, extra cool and much appreciated.  You guys rock!

<DD>Beldin - that is exactly correct.  I own nothing I write for the show.  It's rather amusing to get a call from Thomas every couple of months asking for a CD of this theme or that theme...<BR>
<BR>
Happy Victoria Day everyone!<BR>
<BR>
I'll come back tomorrow to re-plug my Ape show.<BR>
<BR>
Bye<BR>

<DD>DarkLady - I'm staying mum on the episode, except to say... how in the HELL did I suffer through this insanity 22 times last year?  Film schedules are positively luxurious in comparison, and I've gotten spoiled during my TV hiatus.

<DD>Kiba Rika - never thought of Joss that way before...<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - you can you can huh!<BR>
<BR>
memphis - there will definitely be more.  We've been playing for ourselves for about a year and a half now, and only recently decided to start playing in public and make a record.  We hope to play on a regular basis around town.  Just not quite yet... we're still pretty green with this whole band thing.<BR>
<BR>
Amberlynne - despite the heroic efforts of Circe and save the score, things don't look good.  I just heard the "Millenium" CD has been indefinitely put on hold.  I know the Buffy score CD was lumped in with the Millenium CD as far as Fox was concerned, so... it just doesn't look good.  Sorry.

<DD>And a hello and wow! back to all of you!  What a nice welcome.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Jane and Jimmy are doing great.  Jimmy's almost crawling.  You can see he's on the verge of figuring it out.<BR>
<BR>
Yes yes, I did score the 100th.  I guess this means I'm a real VIP again.  color codes, anyone?  (e is above)

<DD>Hey, it's been a while.  (Almost a year??)<BR>
<BR>
Just want to say hey, and happy finale, and a plug for my band.<BR>
<BR>
PLUG FOR MY BAND<BR>
<BR>
Any interested So-Cal Bronzers:<BR>
<BR>
My band, Ape Quartet, will be playing at Temple Bar in Santa Monica one week from tomorrow night, Tuesday, May 29, at 9:45 PM.<BR>
<BR>
Details at www.templebarlive.com.<BR>
<BR>
We (me and my partner, Mark, form the "quartet") play live, improvised techno.  This will only be our second gig EVER so go easy on us please.  We're in the midst of finishing our first CD as well.  It should be done by August.
