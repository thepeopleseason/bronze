<dd>Y_Slayerbelle:  Dead Things was edited by the amazing Lisa Lassek.  She also edited Once More, With Feeling and is currently hard at work editing the pilot for Firefly.  And did I mention she’s gorgeous? <br><br>Tralfamadore2001:  Big Doug Petrie is nobody’s figment, baby.  <br><br>TAMZ:  Good to be seen and right back at you.<br><br>Sarah’s Carl:  The first Buffy I watched was the pilot.  I hated the movie and thought it was a really bad idea for a series.  By the end of episode three was telling everyone who would listen it was the best thing on TV.<br><br>Phil PhuD:  Haven’t seen it.  But if you liked it, I’ll give it a shot.<br><br>Smiley Face:  That’s a tough one.  One of my favorite Buffy lines that I’ve written so far would have to be in ep. 19, “Charge the Cerebral Dampener.”  ‘Cause heck, when do you get to write stuff like that?<br><br>JV3:  Your existence is formally recognized.  That’ll be $12.50<br><br>Tvsurfer:  As I’ve said to others before, I refuse to enter into an argument over the merits of any episode – or an entire season.  I leave the rough stuff to Fury.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  Thanks for the counterpoint.  But let me make it clear to everyone:  feel free to complain that you don’t like what’s happening on BTVS.  Heck, I complain about movies and TV shows every day.  Just understand that making a TV show is complicated business.  We try our best, but we’re not always going to get it right.  And for the love of all that’s sweet, if you hate what you’re watching, turn the channel.  I do it all the time.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Thanks!  Glad you enjoyed that early draft of Dead Things.<br><br>Ariel:  If you don’t steer clear of the spoilers, my head will explode.<br><br>Greeneyes:  It’s nice to be right about something.<br><br>Paradox:  I hope 19 does it for you.  It’s some pretty cool stuff in it.  Thanks Joss!<br><br><br>And now my friends I must depart for a pot-pneumonia nap.  Stay cool.  And for those of you with an X-Box or Playstation 2:  SSX Tricky rocks.  <br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Invincor:  Hopefully you’ll see one of your problems addressed later this season and next season.  And that’s all this kid’s saying about that!<br><br>Jason:  Thanks!  Sarah and Amber did a great job with that one.  And – one more time – Jim Cotner nailed the directing.<br><br>Dogmeat:  Thanks! And I’m good with the garlic – just had some on my pizza last night.  Mmmm.  Pizza…<br><br>UpsetTummy:  Didn’t I warn you those spoilers would ruin your dinner?  As for the drugs, well, uh, I didn’t inhale.  Much.<br><br>Elusio:  Little is relative.  I hope.<br><br>Evalie:  Tsk tsk.  On a family board no less.  You little scamp!<br><br>Miller’s angel:  Nekkid Spike?  I’ll work my magic and see what I can do.<br><br>Rias the Host:  Thanks!  Now quick!  Dodge that evil boss!  Or better yet – turn him into a Buffy fan!<br><br>White Wings:  I hear you.  Had dinner with some friends last night – then slept for 13 hours.  And there wasn’t even any beer involved.<br><br>Partyman:  What ode where?  Repost!  Noxon is writing 20, Petrie 21, and Fury 22.  It’s the big guns, baby.<br><br>Eibhilin:  What’s a set up?<br><br>OneStepBeyond:  He who looks at spoilers gets the sour milk.  You get nothing from me, baby!<br><br>DeAn;):  Yeah, I got it rough.  Especially that crappy office filled with toys and movie posters.  Jeez, I gotta get a better job.<br><br>Jason:  I haven’t seen it yet.  Perhaps I’ll pass.  And something’s always coming up with Dawn.  Ad hey – Charisma.  Swoon.  She’s even more beautiful in person.<br><br>Bhd:  Thanks for the advice.  Just don’t burn the place down, Milt.<br><br>GiftofAmber:  Thanks!  <br><br>Evalie:  Learned your lesson, didn’t you?<br><br>Malum_Forma:  Your love of Dead Things has redeemed you admirably.  Stop kicking yourself and let me get in there.  Pow!  (That was Love Bucks, by the way.)<br><br>Ergoshakes:  Always a pleasure taking pics with the purdy ladies.<br><br><br><br><br>Okay, one more quick round and then this bird's gotta fly.<br><br>

<dd>Tralfamadore2001:  Itty bitty Steve’s lungs are mighty too.  Watch him blow!<br><br>Eric:  I formerly hail from Millville, NJ.  Teeny little town down south, about an hour inland from Atlantic City.<br><br>Smiley Faces:  Thanks.  Joss had always planned to set the troika up as comedy relief – then have them turn dark.  Trust in Joss!  I sure do.<br><br>Major Wiggins:  I confirm or deny nothing.  Just expect a few surprises – if you steer clear of those nasty spoilers.<br><br>Phil PhuD:  As far as I’m concerned, Elektra died when Bullseye killed her – and she stayed dead.  Yeah, Jane Espenson and I each wrote three of the BTVS cartoon scripts.  Currently the project is looking for a network to air it.  Hope that happens soon – it’d be a really cool, really funny (that’s right – FUNNY) show.<br><br>Moriah:  The pleasure is all mine.<br><br>

<dd>Malum-forma:  DeKnight’s a jackass that’s deluded himself into thinking he’s a real clever pill.  Don’t believe a word he says.  I sure don’t.<br><br>Bhd:  Yeah, I usually hang on Fridays, but I’ve been busy or ill lately, hence the special visit.  As for my health, I worked so hard on episode 19 that it sent me into a bout of pneumonia.  Luckily I caught it before little Stevie needed to spend a month in the oxygen tent.  Yee-hah.<br><br>Y_Slaybelle:  That Sarah’s pretty great, huh?  And kudos to big Jim Cotner for directing the hell out of Dead Things.  Jim da man, baby!  <br><br>Jamboski:  I’m miles behind too.  Look!  We’re two behinds!<br><br>Kenickie:  One man’s tacky is another man’s fancy.  And I’m EXTRA fancy.<br><br>Paks:  I do hope you’ve been avoiding those nasty spoilers.  That goes for the rest of you too.  Right now we’re filming episode 20.  21 and 22 are both being written as we speak.<br><br>And a special shout out to the goddess known as Tiggy.  She went to major trouble organizing a lunch with DeKnight – and then I had to bail due to episode 19 writage.  I suck – she rules.  But you already knew that, didn’t you?<br><br>

<dd>Yo ho ho, Bronzers!  My lungs have return to their normal mighty inflation, so I'll be stopping by for a chat in a few minutes.  Slip on those gloves and let's go a few rounds.  Come on!  Put 'em up!  Put 'em up!<br><br>
