<DD>Oooh this is just terrible.  I swear up & down - last post.<BR>
<BR>
Quickly:  Parthenon - sorry if I came off as condescending.  I was just having a bit of fun.  I write the background music for "Buffy".  Angle man is a regular here at the Bronze who provides "alternate" bios of VIP's.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of which... Angle Man: hehehehehe.  I just emailed that to my mom for verification.<BR>
<BR>
please?  bye?

<DD>Quickie response to DeM (and how fitting to further honor Ty in this manner) - the singer's name(s) I mention below are very rough translations.  My wife would know better what to call her so that your firend might recognize her.  Alas she is currently of the unreachable...<BR>
<BR>
bye for real now

Hi Strange One.<BR>
<BR>
Masquerade - Sometimes, for some strange reason, I hear a voice call to me as I sleep (not my dog Joey's)... "musical chairs (composer)... musical chairs (composer)..."  It really confuses me.<BR>
<BR>
Angel Lover 24-7, Holly Frogg - thanks. <BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - OK, when it's done (I don't even know what it's called but the singer's name is either Pan Cloud or Michelle Pan depending on whom you talk to) I'll figure out a way for y'all to pick up a copy if you want.  It might only be available in Asia... we'll see.  And don't worry, I won't answer that.<BR>
<BR>
Time for lunchies<BR>
<BR>
bye

<DD>Penultimate post...<BR>
<BR>
melanie - thanks.  I hate you too.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Pam - my favorite piece changes all the time.  Not coincidentally my favorite piece right now is one I just wrote.  It's the penultimate scene in "Helpless"... I actually was able to record it with a REAL string section (24 players).  I snuck it into our sessions yesterday for my wife's album (shhh don't tell her).  <BR>
<BR>
It's amazing... I spend so much time tweaking my sampled strings and making them sound as real as possible, then I go stick a piece of music in front of a bunch of great string players, and... wow.  So that's what strings sound like.  I needed to be reminded.  (For those of you keeping score - this piece goes under the Giles/Buffy scene in the library after the big showdown near the end of the show.  That is if Joss likes it...)<BR>
<BR>
? - heya.

<DD>DReddd - your col<i></i>or-starvedness amazes me.  And, no way.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man, thanks for trying that out... <BR>
<BR>
...this is all quite silly really.  (Isn't it?)  <BR>
<BR>
I bet someone is now going to compile a list off all the VIP bizarro-names.  3 so far...<BR>
<BR>

<DD>CHRIS - I no longer pay much attention to hockey.  But I was a Canadiens <i>freak</i> when I was little.  I saw them win the Stanley cup in '77.  (I cried and cried and cried until my mom gave up her ticket and let me go with my dad.  To this day I'm amazed at her selflessness... I sure as hell wouldn't give up a Stanely Cup final ticket for any kid of mine...)<BR>
<BR>
musical chairs (composer) - LOL!  So you see 'tis really I.<BR>
<BR>
Hi AuroraStar, Holly Frog (cool name you got)<BR>
<BR>
A Polite Newbie - you mean of my wife's album?  Well, think of the sound of Jewel's records (well-recorded, acoustic) with a slightly over-the-top histrionic voice singing MOR-ish tunes in Chinese.  Still interested?<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - I have also "met" Mike Zeares, he does seem cool.  And I'm happy you seem to have found more space.<BR>
<BR>
melanie - Why can't SS tell me himself?  Not that I mind hearing your pretty voice.

<DD>Pam - hi and thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Jean Quidam - obsequiosity be damned - the piece you are referring to is most likely the B/A love theme (used, for example, as Buffy sent Angel to Hell).  The sad bits from Anne are actually (supposed to be!) a different piece.  But sometimes when I have to write a theme really fast it comes out sounding a little similar to a previous theme or another... one of the many perils of TV music writing.  So you're forgiven for getting em mixed up.  Oh, your question... yeah I wrote that.  Thanks for the compliments.<BR>
<BR>
DReddd - I couldn't post in col<i></i>or after my introductory remarks.  I'd lose all credibility.  And think of Ty.  Has he not earned <i>his</i> VIP col<i></i>ors too?<BR>
<BR>
gazoo - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Intoit - notice my verbage too please.

<DD>Masquerade - sometimes I wonder if it's really me myself...<BR>
<BR>
...you'll just have to take my word for it.  I'm curious what would happen if someone tried to impersonate me.  Isn't it true that if you type "Joss" in the "Your Name" field it comes out as "delusions of grandeur" or some such thing?<BR>
<BR>
Going soon for behindness is growing.

<DD>Sarah W - hi.  The PB gets a bad rap over at the ng.  But I must say... the ng for its part seems to have scared you off pretty good.  What happened?  <BR>
<BR>
and... coolies on the CBCC.  Any luck getting more space?<BR>
<BR>
CharlieX - you must have seen it off the sat feed.  Thanks for the compliments... though "Gingerbread" is not my favorite score or episode.  The score for "Helpless" kicks its butt.

<DD>gazoo- hi and my weekend is going fine.  I'm juggling 3 projects right now - finishing up my movie "Guinevere", finishing "Helpless", and producing an album of songs my wife wrote featuring a semi-famous Taiwanese pop star (my wife's first high-profile album project).  We just recorded a string section yesterday in San Diego, and now I'm back in the studio scrambling to finish "Helpless" on time.  <BR>
<BR>
Story of my life...

<DD>I see Ty has returned.<BR>
<BR>
I've never met the guy, but the reverence displayed towards him in the Bronze is very impressive.  In his honor, my posts today will be in non-VIP white.<BR>
