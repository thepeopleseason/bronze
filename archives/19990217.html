<DD>Argh.  I wrote a long response and something happened to it.  First of all, enthusiasm is never gushing, at least in my book.  So, thanks for the wonderful enthusiasm.<BR>
<BR>
Re. ideas: We work hard to come up with stuff that's interesting and hopefully fresh. I hope we succeed more often than not...<BR>
<BR>
Writer's block:  Deadlines are the cure, most of the time.  If you don't have an externally imposed one (viz, from your editor), give yourself one.  Or you might be blocked because you don't know what to do next.  Ask yourself some questions, such as, what's the goal of this section?  <BR>
<BR>
Or you may be intimidated by the amount of writing you think you face.  Break it down into smaller chunks.  Set interim goals:  "I'll write a page every day" or "I'll write for an hour."

<DD>quick post as i am in a whup storm.<BR>
<BR>
SPOILER<BR>
<BR>
just finished reading the board and came back with hair vs. evil and tanning is bad for old girls.<BR>
<BR>
well let me be the one to say it is good to see these two with the self assurance to do as they like. try new things.  i for one loved Sarah's hair with bangs, and yes wasn't as fond of it platinum blonde, but it's still just hair.<BR>
Hey the way i see it cordelia could look forty and be completely bronzed - i say show me the tan lines, baby, and if there aren't any -- then.. hubba hubba.  and as for Sarah, well you could shave off all her hair and i'd still be there drooling and raving at her performance.<BR>
<BR>
How bout that mayor, he rocks... of course he's lacking a good assistant... hmmm i wonder... maybe he needs a pizza delivery boy!<BR>
<BR>
SPOILER<BR>
<BR>
ok, gotta bolt to the whup mines,<BR>
<BR>
later,<BR>

KimP - I just found my favorite new website.  LOL<BR>
<BR>
Anais - Gabriel Yared rocks, I loved The English Patient.  haven't seen or heard the others tho<BR>
<BR>
KAM - hey back<BR>
<BR>
Whirlwind - I have no idea when the other VIPs plan to post.  Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Moshishi - I love you too (in the non-gross sense, of course)<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen - thanks for sying those nice things.  You may find next week's ep lacking in scary drumbeats however... the ep has a decidely lighter feel to it than "The Wish".<BR>
<BR>
FSMCDMan - working up an appetite for tomorrow...<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - OK, you can tell me the naked boy story some other time.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Mélanie - hi back!  Why do you have Slayed Soul doing all your donkey work?<BR>
<BR>
Hi CharlieS.  Thanks Whirlwind, Anais.<BR>
<BR>
SlayedSoul - I'm somewhat proficient on piano.  Nothing like smashing at a drumset though... it's been a while.  Besides piano I play lots of instruments pretty badly.<BR>
<BR>
Lil Tree - could you ask Mabb to e me please?  And I'm glad we got that unfortunate swipage thing all sorted out.<BR>
<BR>
Samson- I can't believe you gave away Willow finding the cure for the common cold.  Ever heard of SPOILER WARNINGS?  :)</SMALL>

<DD><BR>
buggo, cats, My Willowness, The PLayer, Rile - thanx<BR>
<BR>
cate - hey there<BR>
<BR>
Carl - next week is #50?  How cool is that?  Let's see... #29 for me (if you include SAR which is sort of cheating)<BR>
<BR>
elover thanks and I don't know what the next ep after "Doppel" is called.  Nor do I know when they will repeat S2, though I suspect this summer.<BR>
<BR>
AngLover24-7 - you saw what I look like and... lol?<BR>
<BR>
RSO to Mithrandire.<BR>
<BR>
Jessie - I majored in computer science at Yale until my thirs year when I started to fail out... took a year off, switched to music, and went to the USC program (which is a post-grad program) immediately after graduating.<BR>
<BR>
Labyrynth - OK, looking forward to it.<BR>
<BR>
Anais - I don't know, usually the music coordinator John King does the premilinary selections.  But for a piece as pivotal as that one, I suspect Joss had that one figured out early on.

<DD><BR>
Whirlwind - I agree.  Quickly.<BR>
<BR>
Hey DarkLady.  The certificate continues to look quite spiffy thank you.  Hi back to LP and LJ and... naked boy?<BR>
<BR>
Nipsy - I really dug <i>Bonfire</i>.  OK, sold.  I'm starting this aft.<BR>
<BR>
TouroNut - That car of mine now works.  Are you referring to the week I had to drive a Geo Metro rental cuz my car was in the shop?  And give me your boss' number, I'll getcha that week off.<BR>
<BR>
squireboy - believe me the week in between episodes seems long to me too especially the first half or so during which I inevtiably procrastinate.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - I'm not up for any Emmys I know of.  What happens next week?  Perhaps you mean those stinkin' grammys.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Angle Man.  Thanks WoldShadow.

<DD><BR>
Jane/wife sez high.<BR>
<BR>
Jessie - Here's the short answer as to how I started:  Got interested in scoring as a career in college, went to USC to study it for a year (they have a scoring program), and was ghostwriting for a couple of other compsers shortly.  That led to other gis which led to other gigs and here I am.  Sorry I can't be more detailed...  If you're interested in scoring, I suggest you learn all you can about it, hone your craft (=write a lot), and when you feel ready, move to LA with some $ saved for a small studio.  (OK, deep breath, here I go, first time, please work) Also at <a target='_blank' href="http://filmscoremonthly.com/">Film Score Monthly</a> you can find an article or two on getting started in the archives.<BR>
<BR>
Slay_me - one new ep in all of March (sorry), and one new ep in all of April (sorry again), as far as i know.  You do the math - "Doppel" airs next week and is #16 of 22.<BR>
<BR>
Bruces Mom, RJ - thanks<BR>
<BR>
angelgazer - aren't fellow Canadians allowed?<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic - it was nice meeting you too.

<DD><BR>
Corvus - thanks, and I'll pass along your thanks (in the form of a biscuit) to Joey too.<BR>
<BR>
D Socks - I am quite well.  Suffering from day-off-no-wait-week-off guilt.  But getting over it fast.<BR>
<BR>
Whirlwind - I write the background music.  I don't pick the bands.  Thanks for the compliments.  As to <i>Angel</i>:  I'd love to be involved but a) Joss has not asked me and b) I'm pretty sure I can't handle every ep of both shows (though that wouldn't preclude me doing a few episodes and/or the theme)<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of Law & Order:  Does anybody have last week's two episodes on tape they would be willing to send me copies of?  I'll make it worth your while.  E me if you have em.

<BR>
