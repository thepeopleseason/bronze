<DD>OK, I'm going, now...<BR>
<BR>
Bye, <b>Laurence & Jade!</b><BR>
<b>DZRAY:</b>  I'm so sorry, but I am completely out of the loop re: Charmed.<BR>
<b>Dianne:</b>  Oh...hehehe...d'oh!<BR>
<b>Angelic Sweetie:</b>  Hi!  Been busy, but I've been posting a lot this week.  Ok, I'll bite.  What clubs?<BR>
<b>Arcadia:</b>  Thanks!  We're looking forward to it. =)<BR>
<b>Opus:</b>  Hi and bye, and we're already all lined up for the PBP '99.  (Check the Community page...)  =)<BR>

<DD><b>WintwrRain:</b>  Well, yeah, I really should go.  Got some work to do, band-wise.  But I wanted to say hi before I left.  hehehe  I am leaving, though, I swear.  In fact...<BR>
<BR>
This is my second-to-last post.  =)<BR>
<BR>
<b>StG:</b>  No, only one was...becuase we'd been offered a better, more prestigious gig, and we couldn't do both.  However, we are through with gigging for the rest of the year, since we're putting all our energy into these new songs.  How are you?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Yeah, too much pressure.  We'll just let it be an unofficial position, OK?

<DD>Gotta get going pretty soon...<BR>
<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  It's complicated, so I'll say it in English:  we're putting together a new demo CD to shop to the major labels.  It'll have 3 or 4 songs on it.  We're preparing 5, and then we'll see what our representation thinks are the best of those.  If for some reason we DON'T get a major label deal, then yes, we'll put out a new CD on our own.  Probably by the end of '99.<BR>
<b>Kate:</b>  Nope, I don't have cable.  Can you believe it?<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>Well, thanks for the offer, and I'm very happy it still stands, but I'm OK for now, thank you. =)</SMALL>

<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Don't worry, I fully remember you...  (you promised to come and rescue me from work, like a brave knight, remember?)  I jsut like to cover all contingencies in my ansers, in case other people are using them for information, as well.   =)<BR>

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, if it's going within the continental U.S., you should get it within 7 or 8 days of your sending the the order.  (I check the mail about twice a week, and I always send the orders out with 24 hrs of receiving them.)

<DD>Hi, <b>LITTLE E!</b>  You know, <b>Shadowslayer</b> was just asking about you.  Asked me to say hi.  I think he's around, if you want to say to him. =)<BR>
<b>Ali:</b>  Well, that depends on what you mean by "more people."  We replaced the players on our "Warm" album with new, better, more dedicated individuals.  It's been such a boost to our creativity and general state of mind!  FYI, VelvetChain is, in essence, just Jeff Stacy and myself.

<DD>Ack!  I just blew out my last post...here I go again...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kate:</b>  Would you believe I never noticed that before??  Jeff was in charge of the CD design, etc.  I'm assuming that it was because Sour Times is not our song, and Jeff would rather use the limited space we had to promote our own lyrics.<BR>
<b>Kara:</b>  See my previous posts. =)<BR>
<b>devil:</b>  Non, mais je dois chanter plus tard...pour un "recording."<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, see I disagree, but that's what makes a horse race.<BR>

<DD><b>Kara:</b>  Howdy on back!  hehe...did I slay it?  I sort of tamed it, I think...depending on which bezoar you're referring to.  The Halloween party I attended was nice, kinda mellow, with a really good and super-attentive bartender, who kept making the rounds to refresh everyone's drink.  Very civilized.  Thanks for asking.<BR>
<b>Blackheart:</b>  Hello!  Vocals went well, thanks.  It was just a preliminary scratch-track, but it did come out very well.

<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, I enjoyed it more than any other ep so far this season...and I believe your theory about "long term effects" is correct.  Their definitely setting us up for some interesting plot developments.<BR>

<b>Jen-Pooh:</b>  Glad you like it...and yes, Frenchie is weird, but that's why I like it! =)<BR>
<b>?:</b>  Glad to see I'm not alone in my likage of the episode.  And actually, the whup is not relevant, as I am home this evening.<BR>
<b>darkhorse:</b>  Lovely to meet you.
