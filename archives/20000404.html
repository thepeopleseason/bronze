<b>lurking b.</b>  Thanks for the info!  Nope, no tour...yet!  (Hey, if anough people buy the new CD, who knows?  hehehe)<BR>
<b>JoAnne:</b>  Oh, I really hope you can make it!  =)<BR>
<b<Misako:</b>  LOL...I meant <i>small</i> venues.  Like local clubs/small theaters.  Something that holds anywhere from 200 to 1,000 people.<BR>
<b>dru:</b>  I actually prefer the more rocking, live sounding version.  But most peeople seem to like the trippier, slower version that got chosen for the Buffy Soundtrack.  I think I favor the rockier one becasue the recording quality is better, and I'm very picky that way.<BR>
<BR>
OK, that's it for me.  Have a great night, everybody!  Enjoy LOSERS!<BR>

Malista, I think you're splitting hairs.  The notion was in fact that his soul didn't leave.  He didn't actually "turn" in the "perfect happiness" way.  It was a drug induced loss of control.  The drug simulated bliss.  His "evil" was simulated.  People on drugs might let their dark sides slip out, and do things they don't really mean or want to.  My notion was always that Angel was just underneath.  He could feel it coming on, and was fighting it.  We could have put a finer point on that, however.

<DD><b>Nick:</b>  Thank you!  We have two, actually.  "Warm" is a 13 track CD we released in October 1997.  Our brand new CD is called "Moody Groove Music" and has 11 tracks.  It <i>just</i> got done.  We're having the release party this Friday, and the official release date is Tuesday the 11th. We have them in our hot little hands right now, though, and I am really excited.  =)  You can read all about us and our stuff (and hear it, see video, etc.) at our site, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a><BR>
<b>Misako:</b>  We don't have anything booked yet, but that's a real possibilty. We need to start playing up there, anyway.  Have any suggestions on venues?<BR>

Nick -- we had a few additional thoughts for the Jonathan universe that didn't really make it to the screen -- there were jonathan t-shirts and a jonathan action figure that aren't in the ep.  (Hope you all noticed the Jonnie-Os cereal box, btw) -- but we were very clear right from the start that the world should be not-too-different -- that it should feel like a regular ep of Buffy with that one difference.  We didn't want the joke to wag the story, you might say.<BR>
<BR>
Is there really a Jonathan.com?  It's just something we came up with to put on the posters.   I'm confused... does it exist?

LJC -- very good -- that was indeed a very Court Jester-y fight.  Those who don't know the movie should rent it -- Danny Kaye -- extremely funny.<BR>
<BR>
gazoo -- interesting question about director/writer hierarchy when neither one is Joss... the answer is:  Joss.  Even when he neither writes nor directs he is the ultimate authority. <BR>
<BR>
Haven -- it was Joss's idea to put Danny in the opening credits... in fact, the whole premise belong to him... I just begged shamelessly to be allowed to write it.

PhoenixFlame -- thanks.. and yeah, I did put in the line about the Matrix because of Joss's fondness for it.<BR>

Melody -- sorry you didn't enjoy the ep.  It was a "standalone" -- not much of the "arc" elements, more of a self-contained story with a sci-fi hook.  I don't like to think of them as "filler," but I certainly understand that not every ep speaks to every person.
