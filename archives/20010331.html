<DD>Red Hood:  Kiss the monkey for me, and yes please -- send me the pics!<BR>
<BR>
As for the strike, it's anybody's guess.  We all hope it won't happen, but if we have to strike then strike we will.  Where's my axe handle!<BR>
<BR>
And no, it's not easy being green.<BR>
<BR>
With that, I hear the siren call of deep sleep. <BR>
<BR>
*poof*

<DD>Boo: Studying is much more important.  You have my full support.  But we can't let those Fury and Minear fans trounce us.  Steve smash!<BR>
<BR>
laffin: The jury's still out.  Ask me again next season.

<DD>singsinthtecar: Actually, you did miss me.  I was on this morning before I got sucked up into a Top Secret meeting chocked full of savory state secrets.  And yeah, I'd love a copy of the PBP pic.  You've got the mailing address, right?  That goes for all you, by the way.  Send in those pictures and we'll get Boo to put them up on DeKnight's Riders when he gets the chance.  <BR>
<BR>
Boo?  Hey boo?  You still alive?
