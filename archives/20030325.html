<dd>All right gang, I'd stay and talk, but I don't want to spoil anything before you see Lies, so I'll be back sometime either tonight or tomorrow and we can do a full-on Q&A. <br><br>Hope you like the episode tonight. <br><br>Minions - there could very well be a shout-out to you in tonight's episode.  You know why?  Because I love you.<br><br>You might want to brush up on your Minion addresses before you see the show.<br><br>Also, in other news, Steve DeKnight can fit his entire fist into his mouth.  That's weird.<br><br>Goddard out.<br><br>

<dd>So we got a new one tonight.  Three words for you:  David Friggin' Fury.  Wait until you guys see the job he did with this ep.  The guy is not human. I mean, we all knew he was a brilliant writer, but now he has to go rub it in our faces by being this amazing director as well.  What's next?  Particle physics?  Line dancing?  Wrestling around with Doug Petrie?  Damn Fury.  Damn Fury and his bottomless talent.<br><br>Luckily, I still always beat him at office golf.  Please rub that in his face if he drops by here later.<br><br>

<dd>So let's take time out of my busy, busy schedule to answer a few questions.  Okay, I'll choose one completely at random.  Let's see... how about...<br><br>Q: Sunburst asks, "How does it feel to be smart, good-looking, worshipped, and practically perfect in every way?"<br><br>A: It feels pretty good.<br><br>Thanks for the question.<br><br>

<dd>Well, this is a bit spoilery, but <br>doesn't GIVE A WAY anything so <br>here goes...<br><br>ANGEL Ep 4.17 is NOT <br>to be missed....it explains (or <br>begins to) so much, even stuff <br>from BEFORE season <br>4!<br><br>Also, by the way, the amazing episode of Miracles ("Hand of God", the ep <br>that goes much deeper into the pilot's plot line) I kept telling poeple about <br>weeks ago has been bumped yet AGAIN, becuase of the 2 hour episode <br>of The Practise and will not air tonight. Try again NEXT WEEK!<br><br>Also, regarding Miracles and everything on ABC, 2mins 30 seconds had <br>to be cut from all episodes airing during the War.<br><br>
