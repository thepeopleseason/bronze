<DD>Swoop!  Hey, chica.  : )  Nope, no San Diego Con for me.  Too costly for too little payoff, I'm afraid.  But I'll be at WizardWorld in Chicago the first week in August.  that's always fun.  Yeah, Mel's an old friend, and one of the first who really gave me a shot in comics and believed.  LOVE to hear what gossip she's spreading.  I think.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen--Yes.  Lots, even.  That's my Xander brain working, trying to figure out how I've got so much stuff coming out this spring.  And THANKS for plugging the site.  Did I mention I finished the first Prowlers book?  I must have, but it was a long drive.  Heh.<BR>
<BR>
Slay_me, hey!!  Crash!  Very laid back b-day, actually.  Thanks so much for the wishes on the site.  You should visit more often.  You AND Lab.  Her card was a scream, by the way.  I miss my bodyguards!

<DD>Megdalen!!!!!!!!!!!  Smootches and spine-cracking hugs.  : )  And yep, whips cracking.  But the deadline kind, I'm afraid.<BR>
<BR>
Jo-Jo, I didn't work on WG2, but the books I listed in the last post are all Buffy and/or Angel related.  And that doesn't include all teh comics I'm doing.<BR>
<BR>
Eiddileg--Both.  (he says coyly)

<DD>Anti--I would NEVER abandon the board, silly thing.  : )<BR>
<BR>
ED1--It better be in every bookstore after all the work we put into it.<BR>
<BR>
Zeus--Hmm, right now we've got Monster Book in August (signing at the Salem NH B&N with my co-authors Sniegoski and Bissette on Aug. 16th), Spike & Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row in October, and the serial novel Lost Slayer, which I'm working on right this moment, sometime in the spring.<BR>
<BR>
And lots of my own original work in spring as well.  Lots!

<DD>Hey all.  Just up late working and figured I'd pop by for a quick hello.<BR>
<BR>
Before anyone asks, Monster Book hits stores August 1st.  I finally got a copy and am thrilled.<BR>
<BR>
Hope everyone's doing well tonight . . .
