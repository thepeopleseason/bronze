<DD>I'd just like to go on  record that I have a pretty bad headache, so all the misspellings/typos I've had and will continue to have while I'm here must be chalked up to that, OK?  Ack.<BR>
<BR>
<b>TMorel:</b>  Hi!  Yep, still work there, yep still get customers from Hell, and yep, you still have time to win the lottery and fly us over!  lol<BR>
<b>nimh:</b>  Hi, there!  That's a cool/freaky coincidence!  =)<BR>
<b>ali:</b>  Hi; nice to meet you!<BR>
<b>St. George:</b>  Ah....well, you see, that would be because I'm not a star.  Yet.  hehehehe  No, really...I'm just a struggling musician.  But thanks so much for the ego-boost!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Calen:</b>  Ummmmmmmmmmmmm....thanks?  (I really hope your post wasn't facetious!)<BR>
<b>Spikey:</b>  Hi!  Well, I've been really busy lately.  We wrote a new song, that we're planning to perform for the first time at our show next week.  I also singed up for a few showcases here in LA for my acting career, and I've been working on a couple of independent films for some friends of mine.  =)<BR>
<b>Divaliving:</b>  Hi...Love your name!  ;-)  Nice to meet you!  <BR>
<b>bananaaaaaaaaaaa!</b>  Hi!  Yep, you really should think about acquiring it.  I'm very proud of it.  =)<BR>
<b>David's Chick:</b>  Hey, there!  Well, things are good on the band-front.  We've been approached by a few TV shows etc to use our music (we love that), and our lawyer's been shopping us around to the industry, so we're hoping to have some bigwigs at the next show.  And we wrote a new song.  Well, Jeff really wrote it.  hehehe<BR>
<b>SocKS:</b>  Hi!  Another coincidence!  (I seem to inspire those...)<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  Hi!  Long time, no see!  Still on Yahoo Messnger?  ;-)

<DD><b>Lord Mysty Mage:</b>  I'm fine, thanks...  Mean review, huh?  Well, all the "official" reviews we ever got on <i>Warm</i> were very positive, but hey - that's what makes a horse race.  Not everybody's gonna like your stuff, you know?  But thanks for getting angry on our behalf!  lol  Anyway, <i>Warm</i> is over 2 years old by now...  Hard to believe!  ;-)  Don't worry, though...if you search again, you'll probably find about 20 good reviews to counteract that bad one.  ;-)<BR>
<b>the Name:</b>  Hello, there!  No, we don't have any touring plans yet.  We're looking inot booking some stuff in AZ and NV, though.<BR>
<b>Masquerade:</b>  Why, thanks!  =)<BR>
<b>St George:</b>  Cool!  glad everyone's haveing a good time!<BR>
<b>AKA Becker:</b>  I know you're gone, but Hi!  And I'll look forward to seeing you at the show!  =)

<DD>Hi, <b>Brandi, Melody, and clarrie!</b>  I can't stay long...I'm doing about 1,000,000 loads of laundry, plus I have to drive a friend to the airport, go pick up some alterations, drop by this actors' studio I joined recently, and process lots of CD orders.  (yay!  That's a <i>good</i> thing, so don't think I'm complaining!)<BR>
<BR>
<b>clarrie:</b>  lol!<BR>
<b>Brandi:</b>  Say hi back to your Mom!

<DD>All right, really going now . .<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
But . . .<BR>
<BR>
everyone with other questions feel free to post them at my own Message Board, at my site, www.christophergolden.com.<BR>
<BR>
last two thoughts . . .<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander--possible I'd return to Strangewood some day.  Meanwhile the next original, Straight on 'til Morning, will be out in April.<BR>
<BR>
ergo sum--welllll, I mean, "I" know why Tara did that, but I can't tell you guys.  Joss isn't a big guy, but he'd kick my butt if I let that one slip.  You'll just have to keep wondering.  : )

<DD>All right, actually going now, but . . .<BR>
<BR>
Tara--hey, I saw your post about the heat in Boston.  AC.  What's life without it?<BR>
<BR>
Little bam bam--thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Milk 'n cookies--not soon, but in October you can check out the very first GILES comic book.  It's a 26 page special written by me and Tom S., and drawn by the amazing Eric Powell.  Trust me, you'll dig it.  (Shameless plug, yeah, but no lie.  *s*)<BR>
<BR>
DeAn--you can e me from my site with questions any time.

<DD>Okay, gonna go in a sec. Really just jumping in 'cause of Vanessa's spell . . .<BR>
<BR>
Tara and Roman Around--actually, Nancy just finished WG2 with mutual friends Jeff Mariotte and MaryElizabeth Hart, while I went off and did THe Monster Book with Tom Sniegoski and Steve Bissette.  MB will be out in Aug., WG2 in Nov.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Elusio--hey!  Yeah, come by.  It's been a little slow lately while Little Willow's out of town.<BR>
<BR>
Angeloudi!--YOU haven't been posting the last couple of days at the Emporium.  : )<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander--love to do DC some time, but no plans at present.  Thanks for the kind words.  Just finished the 7th BoE, "Burning Bones."

<DD>Carita--kisses!<BR>
<BR>
Angelnbuffy--just did a couple of signings.  My next pa in Boston might not be for a while yet.  I'll post it at my site when necessary.<BR>
<BR>
littledog--nothing to report on the potential series as yet, I'm afraid.<BR>
<BR>
Dean--you conjured.  Carita e'd me and suggested I "appear" as a result of conjuring.  You don't have to believe.  As for the Passion quote, what quote?
