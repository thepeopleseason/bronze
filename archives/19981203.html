<DD>Well, this resembles a driveby.  the pills are already taking effect and so I crawl into bed, dreading -- uh, gleefully anticipating another funfilled day of hellish labor --uh, wacky fun making  more Buffy eps, endless rows of eps, one after the other, until I die - uh, pass away.<BR>
<BR>
Occasionally I get tired.<BR>
<BR>
Sleep good.

<DD>Twice in one week, what are the odds?  See Buffynerd hanging, told the other writers about your theory -- BYOSubtext is now the watchword at Buffy.  And Godeater quoting Marcus Aurelius, very into him as a youth (brotherhood of Aurelius in ep5 yr1, it all comes around).  And Seth WILL be in Austin Powers 2, it means he'll have to be light in a couple of eps but I couldn't stand in the way of Scott Evil.

<BR>
Goldspike, horizon, haven - (take your pick) hi and/or thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Slay_me - samples of my stuff are not commercially available (yet).  See below for Score CD status or lack thereof.  And thanks for the kind words.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - or else?<BR>
<BR>
Slayed Soul - I moved to Toronto when I was 11.  I studied music at Yale, then a year at USC.  I haven't been to Montreal in years, but I have a new niece there, so now I have a better reason to go one of these days.  And as for anything new you should know about Buffy... well, yes, there is.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow - nope, sorry.  Though I'd love to smooch Todd someday if he'll have me...<BR>
<BR>
Dark Lady - (stepping out of the line of fire) lobby away!<BR>
<BR>
Ali - working on the xmas ep now.  goin great thanx.<BR>
<BR>
Gotta go, if for no other reason than to NIP all you bad bad bad overposters in the bud.<BR>
<BR>
Hope to see some or most of you at the PBP!!<BR>
- Chris<BR>
<BR>
P.S. AjO gave up <i>way</i>too easily on Joss dontcha think?  Where's the tenacity, AjO?

second-to-last post<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - cool.  What do I play?  Or maybe I just run the mixing board.<BR>
<BR>
Pixie, Liddie, VT, Missi - hi<BR>
<BR>
golden girl - I was born & raised in Montreal, after which I adolesced in Toronto.  Speaking of which, CHRIS, I lived in the Town of Mount Royal in Montreal.  And thanks for the compliments.<BR>
<BR>
LW - I can't speak for Todd, but I can speak for myself when I say... hunh?  I thought I saw the little thing they did on me and NO PICTURE.  Unless you have a different magazine than the one I saw...  But, hey, if you've got it, feel free to put it up on yer site.<BR>
<BR>
Lovely Poet - lol and thanks.<BR>
<BR>
heya Sarah W.  Why you no come to LA?<BR>
<BR>
horizon - if you mean the guitar piece at the end of Lovers Walk, yes I wrote that.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - hi and the strings thank you.

<DD><BR>
? - I have every intention of going to the PBP, schedule permitting.<BR>
<BR>
Haven - Thanks.  The B/A love theme is not gone.  It was supposed to be but, like Buffy and Angel's love for one another, it's bound to rear its pretty little head from time to time.<BR>
<BR>
Paris Angel - A score CD <i>may</i> be in the works.  I've actually been contacted by a small scoundtrack-specialty label that wants to put out a score CD, but they have to wait until the song CD is done before they'll know whether Fox will give them the OK.  <BR>
<BR>
And, I took history, harmony, yadda yadda in college - I have a B.A. in music.  I never thought I'd say this but I'm glad I took all those classes - it certainly helps to have as many tricks in your bag as possible when dealing with the insane deadlines of TV composing.<BR>
<BR>
Cirrus, Gregg, CharlieX, Aiglod, Red Thunder, Aurorastar - heyall.

Hey -mere-, your show is "Strange World" right?  I'm curious if you know who they hired for music (if you know and are allowed to tell).  I actually got a call for that show and recommended a couple of my buddies...<BR>

<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Doing fine, thanks.  Gotta run soon, though.<BR>
<b>Jennifer Lynn:</b>  I'm pleased I could give you a happy!  =)<BR>
<b>Horizon:</b>  Hi, there!  I'm looking forward to it, too.  (I love parties, and I love performing, so I'm just all set!!)<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  hmm...I hadn't though of that.  May be I'll have to go do some shopping...<BR>
<b>slay_me:</b>  Hi!  I'm looking forward to it, too.  (I'm getting repetitive, ain't I?)<BR>
<b>JeffK:</b>  That's OK.  I ended up having to miss that ep for rehearsal, so I couldn't have gone, anyway.  The recording, etc. going great!  In fact, the LA PBP will see the live debut of several songs.  Yes, that's right, the partygoers at the LA PBP will be the first human beings on the planet to hear these new VC songs, other than the members of the band.  =)</SMALL>

I just wanted to say that, although I have <i>nothing</i> to do with the planning of the LA PBP, I for one think it's going to be great fun, and I'm really looking forward to meeting you all.  And playing for you, too!  (I only hope music can soothe any frayed nerves...lol)<BR>
<BR>
So, what's this about a sign-up?  Um, am I all set since I'm performing?

<DD>Yes, this definitely feels more like my last one than that last one.  Just saying, not suffering writing Spike.  You want to talk suffering, talk about the Buffy Angel scene I had to write recently.  Crying the whole time -- I tend to act everything out and so tears, tears, after about an hour i'd have to stop, exhausted, and go back to the scene later.  I guess that sort of qualifies as a spoiler.  They have a big scene.<BR>

<DD>As god is my witness, I'll never go posty again!  But on this, my final shot of the evening, I have to address once again the spike thing.  Wasn't drinking when I wrote him,but did have to get into the mood.  I stuck myself in a hotel room (as I often do) and to get that great "My girlfriend dumped me and I'm on a misery binge" feeling, I brought some of the salient albums from my college days.  Thus "Don't tell a soul" and "Let it Be" by the replacements and "Candey Apple Grey" by Husker Du.  Particularly that last one, blasting away as I reeled about, spikelike in my vividly remembered misery.  Just felt the need to share that.  By the by, I hope you all noticed the song he warbles at the beginning is the same song he shouts at the end?  Of course you did.  I insult you iwth the very question.<BR>
<BR>
But enough about me.

<DD>Okay.  Emma, I cannot walk on water.  I can barely swim in it.  But to rattle off a few answers:  Not seeing Xander's homelife soon, though reference is made to it in the xmas ep.  Soundtrack is getting done, we're closing in, I thought htey were going to have it out in feb but I haven't checked lately.  I don't make a move on the soundtrack without the advice of my rockgoddess, Aly  .  And movie... well, it'd be fun.  Maybe someday.  Now stop posting interesting questions so I can leave!

<DD>A last word: spike.  I don't know if James sings.  I do know he acts.  Man, does he act.  I wrote much of Lover's walk, I say because i was proud of the work, and James just hit everything out of the park, particularly the speech a bout love, which a bunch of people have responded to.  What fun.  Plus he's a sweetie.<BR>
<BR>
Why did he go away?  Well, there's just a lot going on.  But he'll be back.  And the other one too, that girl he hangs out with.  What was her name again...?<BR>
<BR>
Saying goodnight, signing off, undressing, flossing like a crazed Mohican, and passing gracefully out....j'oss

<DD>Okay, so I guess I must apologize, Brad.  I just read the piece on Buffy and Faith that Buffynerd linked and By God, I think she's right!  I can't believe I never saw it!  (Actually, desptie my facetious tone, it's a pretty damn convincing argument.  But then, I think that's part of the attraction of the Buffyverse.  It lends itself to polymorphously perverse subtext.  It encourages it.  I personally find romance in every realtionship [with exceptions], I love all the characters, so I say B.Y.O.Subtext!)<BR>
This leads to another issue.  The heightened sexuality and darkness of the last several eps.  Uh, not gonna change any time real soon.  9 and 10 are both pretty out there.  Some of you may think this is good news, some not.  But I promise we'll never be too much of just one thing.  We're just finishing up one of our scariest eps, to be followed hard upon by a deeply (I hope) funny one.

<DD>There is only one active slayer at a time (except now cuz of the WACKY circumstances).  Inactive, I don't know.  The watchers pinpoint the potentials if the can.  In some cultures (like Kendra's) they can announce their presence and whisk the girl off.  In some, they can't.  And sometimes they can't pinpoint the girl until she is called, which is what happened with Buffy.  Now on to important things:  Rick Schroeder was cool on NYPD blue.  My Turkey was moist and delicious.  The Resoration Era was a time of turmoil and crisis.
