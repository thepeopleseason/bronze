<b>Anais:</b>  I'm so happy you like the Buffy EP so much!  I like it, myself!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Bruce's Mom:</b> Well, we moved about 8 miles away from where we were before, but we're still essentially in L.A.<BR>
<b>Oz Lady:</b>  Yeah, that's quite a coinkydink.  I'm really looking forward to getting hooked up.  =)<BR>

<DD>AjO:  The band's OK, thanks. =)  Yeah, I've always been a Mac girl.  I just hate how slow my computer is.  Old o/s.<BR>
<b>Anais</b>  Yes, I did!  Thank you.  Very pretty, and cool added Diva feature.  ;-)<BR>
<b>Icelord:</b>  Hi!  Yeah, it's been a rough past couple of weeks.  I wish everyone well, and hope no-one has to go through the comedy of errors that was Jeff's and my ER experience!!!<BR>
<BR>
Getting sleepy...may leave soon to go read...

<DD><b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hmmmmmm...the guy told me it would be the Spring issue.  I guess that's this one.  Did they have anything about the PBP in there?  If they did, then they just decided to cut out my interview.  That was why I was interviewed - to get my thoughts on the PBP, etc.<BR>
<b>RTBS:</b>  LOL...actually, a few people did offer to help, including Jasmen, but we had a few friends already lined up, so we were OK.<BR>
<b>they Slayer:</b>  Bye!  And bye to Thistle, too!<BR>
<b>Hollyn:</b>  Yeah, moving stinks.  No big news there.  ;-)  Here's my advice.  Really.  Talk AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE when you are not on stage.  Got to bed EARLY.  Get plaenty of rest, and drink lots and lots of water.  Avoid all caffeine.  (Drink only caffeine-free soda, or none at all, and only herbal teas.)  Finally, herb tea (especially chamomile) with honey and lemon will be good for your voice, too.<BR>
<b>brittany:</b>  Well, I hope they use us at least once. That would be great.  Um, not to be a spoiler, but I heard they're not sarting shooting in June anymore. But I could totally be wrong.<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  I'll probably pick it up tomorrow or Wednesday, don't worry.

<DD><b>Clattering:</b>  Hi, nice to meet you.  Good idea about the boxes...I think that may be where I'm headed, actually.<BR>
<b>gazoo:</b>  Hi!  Well, I'm not done, but it's getting there.  Slowly.<BR>
<b>KAM:</b>  Well, I guess Jeff'll get a nice e-mail tomorrow at work, then!  =)  Glad you like the Buffy EP.<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  I'm just glad you finally received the photo!<BR>
<b>Kaoru:</b>  Hi!  Actually, we send overseas all the time.  Really. If you have a credit card, you can simply order any of our CD's or t-shirts - whatever - online.  Go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a> to order!  =)<BR>
RSO to <b>Blueronin!</b>

<DD><b>Jasmen:</b>  Hi, there!  Moving-hell is OK...I mean, for Hell, it's really not so bad.  ;-)<BR>
<b>thy Slayer:</b>  Well, the Imac isn't even hooked up yet.  (I'm still using my old Mac Performa 630 with it's sad little 7.1 o/s.)  We're putting extra memory and stuff into it, so it'll be at least another week.  The move's OK.<BR>
<b>~ceridwen~:</b>  Ah, been lurking, eh?  Well, I am felling much better, but I'm still not 100%.  It takes time, I guess.<BR>
<b>Brittany:</b>  Hehehe...Good thought!!  Actually, David  did suggest to me recently that even he thought we might be good on "Angel."  We'll see.  As far as I know, they haven't started shooting yet, though...so it may not air this Fall.  Maybe mid-season, instead.<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  Hi.  Love that parody!  =)  I e-'d you about the pkg, too.
