<dd>Oh, damn.  Gotta respond.  ;-)<br><br><b>Mr. Holz:</b>  Hey!  I said, "Hey" to you!  =)<br><b>Slayed Soul:</b>  Awwww...you're too nice!  It was so cool of all you guys to come.  And <i>never</i> apologize for being upbeat!  Oh so much better than the alternative!  And yes, I speak Italian, too.  Cool that they used other languages in the play, eh?  I'm suprised you never heard of it.  They're remounting it on Broadway this Spring, with Antonio Banderas as Guido.<br><b>tiggy:</b>  Hey!  It's going great, thanks!  =)<br><b>Ziquam:</b>  Hi!  I am doing just fine, thanks.  And you?<br><b>bhd</b>  Nope, no Kansas plans right now, but one never knows, right?  ;-)<br><br>OK, I really have to jet.  Bye!<br><br>~Erika<br><br>

<dd><b>DawnsMan:</b>  I'm sorry! I didn't see your post, either.  (It's better to put the name of the person you're addressing at the beginning of your post, so they know it's directed to them.)  =)  Anyway, hi, welcome, and yep, we were on in the first season, and we're on the Buffy soundtarck album.<br><b>OldManFan:</b>  I play Maria.  The lead.  hehehe  Can't picture it, can you?  ;-)<br><b>Major Wiggins</b>  Hey!  Yeah, it was really awesome.  Lots of fun.  Sorry you missed it!  =)<br><b>Beldin:</b>  Howdy!<br><b>Cashmere:</b>  Hey!  Nice to see you!<br><br>

<dd><b>puckles:</b>  OK, cool.  I check out the Archives sometimes, so I probably just saw your name there.  =)  Thanks so much for the congrats!<br><b>Zeus:</b>  Ahhh...so I have a special tag-dropping-dispensation from the God of Olympus himself, eh?  Well then, COOL!<br><b>corsa_am:</b>  We would LOVE to come to the UK, but we just don't know how to swing it right now.  We've got just too much going on Stateside, you know?  But it's on our list of things we have to do!  Go play the UK!<br><b>CarpeDi</b>  Bye!  Feel better!<br><br>

<dd><b>Zeus</b>  Great!  Make sure you say hi afterwards...and hey, if you feel like holding up a sign, that's fine, although it's a tiny theater, so you'd probably poke somebody's eye out!  LOL<br><br><b>Old One:</b>  And nice to see you, as well!  Well, in addition to the two shows I'm doing, I'm also very busy working on the upcoming Velvet Chain album, "Asteroid Belt."  (In fact, I shoudl go soon, 'cause I need to get over to the studio to do some recording.)  And I'm always auditioning for stuff, so that keep me on my toes, too.  So, yeo, life is very satisfying right now, thank you!  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>CarpeDi:</b>  Not stupid at all!  The play is going great, thanks!  We had a wonderful performance last night, which was good, 'cause a major reviewer was there.  <i>*phew*</i>  =)  I'm also in rehearsals for my <i>next</i> show, as well, so I'm a busy bee.  Thanks for asking!<br><br><b>Zeus!</b>  Hello!  Yes, it went great, thanks, and your message was relayed loud and clear!  Thank you!  Are you going to be able to make it at all?  We have 8 more shows...<br><br>
