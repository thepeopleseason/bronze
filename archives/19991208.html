<DD>Whoa, a veritable barrage . . .<BR>
<BR>
Chi--um, the Watcher's Guide and other assorted Buffy non-fic.  Also the upcoming Stephen King Universe, and a lot of journalism.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin--hey!  : )  If you mean the next Buffy book, it'll be fall '00.  Otherwise, it's Meets the Eye, the 4th Body of Evidence book, in February.<BR>
<BR>
VT--Hellooo right back.<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel--nope, but that's sure the reference.  And thanks Re; the comic.  Did you see the second one?<BR>

<DD>Oki-Hey, thank you.<BR>
<BR>
Candy Kane--thanks.  the Monster Book, since you asked, is one monstrous pain in the @$$, but I think it's going to be really something when it's done.  As for future hardbacks . . . yep.  Look for my next Buffy novel, SPIKE & DRU: PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW next fall in hardcover.<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel--Yeah, Doug's doing some cool Buffy comics projects for Dark Horse.  As for me, I'm focused at this particular moment on Monster Book, and on my next original novel, Straight On 'til Morning, which will be out next fall.

<DD>OK, I better get going.  Lots to do before the show tonight!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everybody who wished or is wishing me a Happy Birthday!  You guys make me feel great!<BR>
<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  I am coming back to NJ, but not until January, unfortunately.  Work-issues.<BR>
<b>fibs:</b>  Yes, I'm sure we'll have them there, although you can get them at Tower Records right now, if you want.  Or order them online at towerrecords.com or amazon.com or CDNow...  (Tower is the cheapest.  $7.99)<BR>
<b>MedusA:</b>  Thank you!  I'm so glad you've been "converted!"  lol<BR>
<b>Kenickie:</b>  LOL!  Don't!  Silly boy!  =)<BR>
<b>BuffySummers81:</b>  oops!  Sorry if I grossed you out!<BR>
<BR>
OK, I really should get going.  If any of you guys are here in LA, come to the Baked Potato on Sunset and Vine tonight at 10pm for our Lounge Show/Birthday Gig.  (It's all-ages and costs $5.)  Bye!!!!

<DD><b>Little Bam Bam:</b>  I'm not sure I understood your post, but if you mean that Elizabeth and I went out to lunch for my B'day, and you're wondering why, it's because she's my best friend in L.A. and I love her to DEATH.  She rocks.  Lots of good stuff on the horizon for her, too, so all you Elizabeth Anne  Allen fans keep your fingers crossed!!!<BR>
<b>carl:,/b>  Well, THANKS!  *blush*<BR>
<b>lulu:</b> Thank you very much!<BR>
<b>Moriah:</b>  LOL...cool!  Oh, and I like Spike too...<BR>
<b>Angelus:</b>  It <i>is</i> pretty cool, now that you mention it.  =)  We would love to come to Europe, but do not have the funding, unfortunately.  Perhaps in the not-too-distant future!<BR>
<b>BUFFY SHERIDAN:</b>  THANKS!!!!!!!!

<DD><b>Shehawken:</b>  Thanks!  Well, yes, the NEW Buffy EP is different than the first pressing.  It has two extra tracks (Treason and the rock version of Strong as a "hidden" track), plus the artwork is different.  (The front cover now has a "ghosted" image of the Diva icon on the front, and the inside cover features a very cool - IMHO - photo of me performing live.)  Also, they all include a free sticker on the inside.  A NEW sticker.  The old pressing is all done (out of print), so perhaps you should keep that one, in case we get famous and you can auction it off for tons o' cash on ebay!  lol  =)  Of course, I think you should own both versions...  ;-)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  I love Spike so far this season!  I'm so happy he's become a regualr.  Woo-hoo!<BR>
<b>DingoBaby:</b>  Cool!  Sorry for the whup...<BR>
<b>BuffySummers81</b>  Thank you so much!  Not only was I "not feeling well," but I actually threw up.  It was horrible.  I had an EVIL migaine from HELL, and if anyone here suffers from migraines, imagine trying to sing whilr having one.  I still can't believe I did it, actually!  lol<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Hey, you!  Thanks; it has!<BR>
<b>Keira:</b>  Thank you very much!  I had a nice day.<BR>
<b>Pixie:</b>Hey!  If you're going to be in town tonight, you better come to the show!!!  It's all-ages, and only costs $5.  =)</SMALL>

<b>Jasmen:</b>  Cool!  I wasn't sure, since it's a "school-night..."  It should be a really cool evening.<BR>
<b>LilBufBuf:</b>  hehehe...Thanks!  I'm so glad you found it.  They totally screwed up on the categorization of it.  It's a real bummer.  *sigh*<BR>

<DD><b>Angelus:</b>  Cool!  glad you like our music.  No, I didn't have any birthday cake, actually.  I did have some cheesecake for desert at my birthday dinner, though...<BR>
<b>carl:</b>  Hmmmmmmmm....I don't know whether I should be exceedingly flattered (assuming you think I sing well), or upset (assuming you mean I look better than I sing, and I'm only OK-looking....?)  I'll go ahead and take it as a compliment!  So, thanks!  hehehe<BR>
