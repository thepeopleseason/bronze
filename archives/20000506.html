<DD>witness the leavage <BR>
of me.  Hi Jessy, Cindy, cindy, <BR>
blitzen, donner, and everyone <BR>
beginning with G.  NO ONE ELSE.  <BR>
Also, I (sadly) never actually <BR>
join clubs since there are too <BR>
many good ones.  And I ADORE the <BR>
West Wing.  Never miss it.<BR>
<BR>
And not to violate my no <BR>
spoilerishness, but I will say <BR>
this for the season finale:  It's <BR>
strange.  Even for me.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sleep interestingly... j.<BR>

<DD>I don't know why I've <BR>
always been interested in <BR>
feminism.  Probably cuz I was <BR>
raised by brilliant hardcore <BR>
feminist, the renowned and <BR>
influential 'MOM'.<BR>
<BR>
Did anybody else notice Slayer <BR>
girl's juxtaposition of "looks <BR>
like Joss" and "not too hot"?  <BR>
Well, fine!  Take chris carter <BR>
with his broad shoulders and his <BR>
manly chest hair.  I'll be over <BR>
by myself with grape feeders.<BR>
<BR>
As for the army, I don't pick who <BR>
advertises on my show.<BR>

<DD>I really am planning <BR>
to leave.  Very busy -- Saturday <BR>
night, fer cryin' out loud, got <BR>
lots of... parties, many friends <BR>
who... important... porn... NO!  <BR>
SHUT UP!  It's not like that at <BR>
all!  I'm cute and popular and <BR>
have blonde hair.<BR>
<BR>
Actually, I'm enjoying a night of <BR>
veg.  Being on the board is just <BR>
like watching TV, if the show <BR>
that was on was just a bunch of <BR>
typed words, which would kind of <BR>
suck.  So it's different.  stop <BR>
judging me.<BR>
<BR>
Fog, checked out site.  Saw daily <BR>
news.  Was happy.  Then got <BR>
judged by everyone, became <BR>
bitter.<BR>

<DD>Slayergirl, whatever <BR>
you said that would offend my <BR>
marriedness, I must have missed <BR>
it.  So I guess you're forgiven.  <BR>
I feel my self winding down...  <BR>
And for the record, I do have <BR>
scantily clad minions feed me <BR>
grapes while I post.  But not in <BR>
a porn way.  I just need a lot of <BR>
grapes.<BR>

<DD>Slayergirl, all men <BR>
are not pigs.  Oh, did you say <BR>
MEN?  No.  That's... yeah.  We <BR>
are.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  Take the fifth.<BR>
<BR>
I wasn't fired from Roseanne, I <BR>
quit after a year.  Over hiatus <BR>
she fired the entire staff, so I <BR>
probably would have been, but I <BR>
got out with my exciting DIGNITY!  <BR>
DIGNITY!  The last I would ever <BR>
see.<BR>
<BR>
Lilu: did you say my name?<BR>

<DD>Re:  X-men, I heard <BR>
second hand that some cranky <BR>
remarks of mine were put on the <BR>
web, somewhat out of context.  <BR>
i'm not too pleased about that.  <BR>
I didn't have a great experience, <BR>
but I was just a small part of <BR>
the process.  It's not my movie <BR>
and for all I know the final <BR>
product may rock.  But I let off <BR>
a little steam and hey, what with <BR>
this wacky modern interweb and <BR>
all, it started to sound like I <BR>
was picking a fight with fox.  <BR>
Not so.<BR>
<BR>
As for thoughts on porn, I have <BR>
never had any.  Okay, that's a <BR>
slight lie.  Couldn't study <BR>
feminism and not come across the <BR>
issue.  The only sweeping (and <BR>
rather obvious) statement I would <BR>
make is that pornography lies in <BR>
objectification.  The distance <BR>
between us and the person/act <BR>
that makes what we are seeing <BR>
abstract.  Depiction of sex or <BR>
nekkidness or violence (or <BR>
naziism) that has nothing to do <BR>
with the interior life of the <BR>
thing depicted, that is just a <BR>
mindless visual (or text) trying <BR>
to elicit a very specific <BR>
reaction.  I'm becoming more <BR>
obtuse by the minute.  It's hard <BR>
to type and eat.<BR>
<BR>
All in favor of me shutting <BR>
up....<BR>

<DD>The buffy roof scene <BR>
in Sanctuary was in fact mine.  I <BR>
basically wrote the Buffy scenes, <BR>
and Time did most of everything <BR>
else (it was he who insisted I <BR>
share credit with him, cuz he's <BR>
cool).  Personally, my favorite <BR>
scene was the faith/Angel <BR>
microwave talk.  Go timbo.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin, what do you offer me for <BR>
this your fifth?  Also, what the <BR>
hell are you talking about?<BR>
<BR>
And by the way, i don't know <BR>
anything about nick and <BR>
Spiderman.  Works for me, though.<BR>

<DD>curlyhare1, hi.  Now <BR>
your life is perfect.  <BR>
Congratulations.  <BR>
<BR>
Cansors.  Don't love 'em.  But I <BR>
did want to clear up something.  <BR>
I may push the envelope a tad, I <BR>
may make fun of the Standards and <BR>
Practices guys, but I'm not <BR>
actually out to stick it to them.  <BR>
We've actually had a pretty good <BR>
realtionship over the years, and <BR>
I like that.  They have a family <BR>
viewing audience to think about, <BR>
and I have a commitment to porn, <BR>
and between the two -- oh god.  I <BR>
didn't just say porn, did I?  I <BR>
don't know where that came from.  <BR>
I meant art, or course.  That's <BR>
so weird.<BR>
<BR>
By the by, I just want to say <BR>
officially that I do know the <BR>
difference between bigotry and <BR>
someone just not liking the ep.  <BR>
I just happen to dig it.<BR>
<BR>
I have never spanked my <BR>
creations.  And by never I mean <BR>
seldom, and by seldom I mean <BR>
porn.<BR>
<BR>
Wait.  No.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, god...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Hollyn -- I'm not <BR>
sure.  I think Marti and Jane <BR>
were involved, but there may have <BR>
been more.  It's hard to figure <BR>
out who's doing what since <BR>
they're all conspiring against <BR>
me.<BR>
<BR>
I like the part where i'm a <BR>
hottie.  I do think I may have a <BR>
sort of dicck-van-patten kind of <BR>
charm.  God help me.<BR>
<BR>
And yes, no wolf attacked Graham.<BR>
<BR>
Mojoman:  Insane?  Insane, you <BR>
say?  You say insane?  Insane was <BR>
said by you?  You are the sayer <BR>
of 'insane'?  Saywise, 'insane's <BR>
your pitch?  Saney saney say?<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure I follow you.<BR>

<DD>"And, yea, there came <BR>
unto them episode 19, and Willow <BR>
did do unto others in an <BR>
alternative <BR>
lifestyle-type-way..."<BR>
<BR>
"...and, lo, the posting board <BR>
did become an cranky place, that <BR>
the bile should flow and niggling <BR>
arguments should take up much <BR>
space..."<BR>
<BR>
"...and Joss did look upon his <BR>
works, and did think they were <BR>
good, 'cause let's face it, Joss <BR>
thinks A LOT of himself, yea, and <BR>
he did read the multitudes <BR>
speaking unto him that he was <BR>
ratings whore who had run out of <BR>
ideas, and that was less good, <BR>
but he spake to them thus:"<BR>
<BR>
"Dudes.  Chill."<BR>
<BR>
"Then laughed they at him, and he <BR>
did turn red and get kind of <BR>
pissed, but then he (yea) spake <BR>
again, saying:"<BR>
<BR>
"I think we need a new topic <BR>
here.  I'm gonna have to do <BR>
something radical here.  i'm <BR>
actually starting to miss the <BR>
whole Bring-Back-Doyle thing.  <BR>
Maybe I should kill somebody.  I <BR>
mean, somebody fictional.  That's <BR>
sure to piss someone off, get <BR>
some new life into the board.  <BR>
It's that or the Chris Beck <BR>
cameo, and NO ONE WANTS THAT."<BR>
<BR>
And, yea, they did see Amber, and <BR>
the hottiness thereof, and did <BR>
say, cool....<BR>
