<DD><vpurple>  Well.  I'd better quit loafing and get going.  Thanks for all your kind words...  I can tell you that you will still see lots of Giles, more Anya and Spike...  And that's all I can say.  Some cool new characters...  And Buffy and Angel aren't totally without contact you know...  Hummmm.  Can't wait for more Buffy fun...  Talk to you all soon (sooner than a year - I promise.)

<DD>  I too miss Angel.  The Buffy/Angel romance was such an enormous emotional pit of angst and romantic longing...  Not to mention good old fashioned lust...  But, be certain, we here at Buffy plan on providing you with lots more of the same.  Even if we have to wear pin-striped suits and fire a lot of people to do it... Really - lots of romantic/heart-breaking stuff ahead.  We'd all go into DT's without the stuff.<BR>
<BR>
As for my deal - all that means right now is that I am working on both Angel and Buffy...  But sometime down the road I hope to developing my own series idea - most ideally under the auspices of the genius we mere mortals call Joss.

<DD>I have written two eps. so far for the current Buffy season and have another one on the works.  I've also been doing more real life "producing" type stuff - I walk around in my   pin-striped power suits and fire people - but, oddly - they're always here the next day...  I'm sure once I perfect my "air of authority" they're really going to leap when I say boo.  Or something...  I'm also consulting on Angel and have done a fair amount of writing on that show.  Re-writing, that is.  So you won't see my name on the eps.  (that's called flying below the radar - if you hate them I won't take any of the blame...) As for the new season - I can honestly say I think you'll all be pleased.  Lots of new stuff with the a lot of familiar Buffy-land elements as well.  As sad as we were to leave the high school setting - this is a fun breath of fresh air.  Feel like I can't say too much about the haps - just that they are interesting and unexpected...

<DD>  Hey all.  Haven't been on the board in about...  a year?  Feels like that long..  See what happens when a lonely writer gets a boyfriend and a dog in the same year?  (Not that I'm complaining...)  Anyway - I'm starting to get psyched for the new season and hope ya'll are too...  Joss could use lots of warm fuzzies about right now if you have them to give.  The X-MEN thing has bummed him down - as it would anybody.  Fox Films es muy stupido on this one if you ask me...  To all of you who IM me when I'm on the web - please don't take it personal if I don't IM back.  I'm ususally doing research for work or answering e-mail and about to dash off...  Or I have just dashed off and left the computer on.  So.  I believe "Earshot" is finally on this week.  For those non-Canadians out there - it's a great ep.
