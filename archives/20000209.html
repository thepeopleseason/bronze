<b>Thoin:</b>  Well, "The Buffy EP" - a 6 song CD we put out around the same time as the soundtrack CD - is available at most Tower Records and bor<i></i>ders Books and Music stores.  Our other CD, "Warm," is much harder to find, unfortunately.  Hey, why don't you get a money order and buy BOTH CD's and maybe a t-shirt and a mug, so the dollar amount will be higher!  LOL!<BR>

If you chose to believe she was jealous of Buffy from a romantic stand-point, doesn't bother me none.  Whichever the case, it's moot now.

<DD> I didn't write "Beer Bad."  That would be the lovely and talented Tracey Forbes.  Sorry you didn't care for it, but your reaction reminds me of some fan reactions to "Go Fish," my first ep.  Both GF and BB were meant to be frivilous fun eps. that purposely diverged from the series arc to, in effect, cleanse the pallet before some of the heavier stuff (like "Wild At Heart.")  <BR>

The WB should just give him all of the money they allocate for those other angst dramas and let him use their budgets on BUFFY.  It should be an all buffy network anyway.

<DD>KrazyKat - I think you're on to something.<BR>
<BR>
If they are out to get you but you don't know it, is it still paranoia or just common sense?<BR>
<BR>
And if Buffy and Riley did have a baby, would it be more like say ... Jonathan or Anya?<BR>
<BR>
These are the thoughts running through my ... y'know, like head.

<DD> Note to self:  * give col<i></i>or code to Blucas.  Receive kick to nuts from Fury.  Leave cheesecake outside Sarah's trailer.  Wash those stinking pads.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Now I'm officially in the LOSER mode.

<DD> Don't worry.  When I see him I'm going to make sure that he gets the codes so you guys can talk to him.  I think he's just been laying low to check on the Riley response.  Not many actors have stopped by (only writers and loudmouthed stunt coordinators)  I'll bet a lot of folks would love to talk to him.<BR>
<BR>
Just think back to the days of "Who is this Oz guy anyway?  He'd better not make a move on Willow."  Does anyone recall that?

<DD>DeMoriel - In that case I'm the one who was overwhelmed.  I never even saw it.  He did where knee and elbow pads while performing the end of a Riley stunt that you'll see on your friendly WB stations next Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
The room just feels nicer that Marc was here.  No really.  He's really nice.  I'm not just doing publicity hype here.  He really is.  Really.

<DD>I kind of think that maybe Marc was overwhelmed by the response.

<DD>I'll have to check and see if that was really Marc or not.  I think it was.  He had told me that he didn't know how to use col<i></i>or yet.  Then again he didn't answer my question either.  Fury seemed to think it was him though.<BR>
<BR>
It sounded like him.  I know that he lurks.  Maybe I'll see him Thursday.  <BR>
<BR>
notXG - Thanks.

<DD> Getting sleepy ... but must remain awake.  I'm just waiting for Sophia to get home.  She's busy working on another show (that I can't name here) doing things (that I can't talk about yet) <BR>
<BR>
I'll just be glad when she's back.  Doesn't she understand the LOSER hours concept?  The insane ones arrive.  I shouldn't be alone too long.

<DD> Krazy Kat - I did use two 50 ton cranes a distance of 400 feet apart.  The actual double travel rig is one that I designed and built in my garage the weekend before the shoot.  I used the standard up & down cable rig and a forward and reverse loop set to an electric wench.  One of my stunt guys controlled the up and down to try to keep the guys from flying too high off the ground or sinking too low.<BR>
<BR>
redsun - Mazda good.

<DD>Sorry I harp on the whole stunt issue so much.  But what has happened in Hollywood is that Stunt Performers have becaome bargaining chips to SAG (our Union)  I think a part of this is due to the fact that we get zero recognition for our work.  <BR>
<BR>
There used to be a saying many years ago that studio execs were always afraid of writers getting too much credit.  That's why they were treated so shabbily.  The studio bosses always felt that if the writers ever got to produce and direct that they'd be more in the drivers seat.  That has happened in television.  A lot of writers are creator/producers and have a huge say (not to mention salary)  The "created by" credit is the one to have now.<BR>
<BR>
Only one stuntman gets to call his shots right now.  That's Jackie.  He's the only star that harkens back to the day of my heroes like Douglas Fairbanks.  Stunt actors.  Now we only have actors who claim to do stunts, but can't.  And stunt people who have to pretend not to exist in order to keep working.

<DD>Nazguls - Yep.  Marc does the kip-up thing and so does James.  Soon everyone will be doing it.  It'll be a craze.  Like, instead of drinking after seeing a bra strap (the way they used to in 2nd season) they'll have to throw kip-ups.  Kip-ups could be an exercise video.
