<DD>pa: lol. you know all to well how to use "aboot" in a sentence. v and v: i love slim shady. you are on the team. i don't know which team, but i find one. and to everyone else, it has truly been a pleasure. good night. in closing, it is most definitely in my best interest to co-exist with Marc. graham's future is with riley. . .

<DD>lbb: thank you for the defense. yes its a bit much for a post virgin to handle but hey, i'm not making excuses. if you get to see more of graham next season then maybe you will get a better sense of my unorthodox sense of humor. speaking of: to all you GLR's you better make sure Marc knows where your loyalties are. can't be crossing the series reg's (i.e. leonard.)

<DD>a new pc yes that would be nice. that would cost about. . . two episodes on buffy. so talk to Joss i guess. i can't really talk about graham's future in season 5, only that the possibilities are endless (or beginingless) whatever the case may be?

<DD>Hey all.  Hope everyone's doing well.  Thought I'd bop in with a quick message for all SO-CAL BRONZERS.  Though Little Willow will undoubtedly be trumpeting it in the next couple of weeks, I am going to be signing at Dark Delicacies bookstore in Burbank, CA, from 7-9 pm on Tuesday, Aug. 22nd.  Hope to see some familiar faces, and lots of new ones.<BR>

<DD>hey, y'all.  i figured i should post something here before my membership expired.  you had to pay the dues, too, right?  fifty bucks to David Greenwalt? it wasn't just me, right?<BR>
<BR>
a special good luck to both <b>Night Owl</b> and <b>Closet Buffyholic</b> on taking that wretched test from the lower intestines of Hades.  in your honor, i tell my favorite lawyer joke:<BR>
<BR>
Q: How do you get a lawyer out of a tree?<BR>
<BR>
the answer's below my siggy.<BR>
<BR>
also, i hear congratulations are in order for my <b>Fuzzy D</b> and <b>Corpelia</b> -- so, <u>CONGRATULATIONS</u>!!!<BR>
<BR>
greetings and salutations to everyone else -- i'm home working on my third draft of the fifth episode.<BR>
<BR>
<b>MINIATURE SPOILER</b><BR>
<small>it's called "Untouched".</small><BR>
<b>END MINIATURE SPOILER</b><BR>
<BR>
"third draft?" you say.  "<i>third</i> draft?"<BR>
<BR>
and i reply, "i, -mere-, keen inventor and innovator of our times, have found entirely new and undiscovered ways to suck."<BR>
<BR>
hence... third draft.  <BR>
<BR>
so as soon as i finish this post, i will be dashing off the internet (o foul fiend of the devil, Procrastination!) to dive into Scriptware.  i'm thinking about taking all the sucky parts out, and replacing them with parts that don't suck.  or, conversely, taking all the parts that don't suck... oh, wait.  crap.  i don't have any of those.  okay, so i guess i'm going with the removal of the sucky parts and replacing them with anti-suck components.  you think Joss'll notice if i just shunt in the entire two last acts of "Lie To Me"?<BR>
<BR>
<small>one script, not even shot yet, and already i'm a big fat hack.</small><BR>
-mere-<BR>
