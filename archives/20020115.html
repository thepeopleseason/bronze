<dd>forgot the color codes again -- large heaving surprise.<br><br>making with the inside scoop:<br><br>- this eppy ran a little long, so we had to cut some stuff for time.  this includes a scene from "Cordy!" and a longer decision-making process pre-"so demonize me already".  fyi.<br><br>- i'm just not going to mention the may 22 birthday thing.  so don't ask.<br><br>- that was the inimitably lovely and talented Ms. Marti Noxon on vocals for the "Cordy!" theme song, as well as Supreme Angel Poobah himself, Mr. David "Greenie" Greenwalt. them two've got some pipes, no?<br><br>- <b>RTBS</b>: keep the faith, brotherman.  keep the faith.  we will not disappoint you. <small>[um... i don't think.]</small><br><br>- there were two small Bronzer shoutouts to my wifey <b>Ccool</b> and my bud <b>fenric</b> -- and those of you who know these two will know where they were.<br><br>- <u>you will never know what's in the box.</u><br><br><b>tralfamadore2001</b>: WHOA. the "bitty -mere-"? WHOA.  i never had my own action figure before -- that is <i>excellent</i>.  can i have the Steve DeKnight one to... uh... do experiments on? very scientific and justifiable experiments, i assure you.<br><br>gotta dash..<br><br><small>"I'm not really inspiring any awe anymore, am I?"</small><br>-mere-<br>sigJTT<br><br>

<dd>little wiggins,<br><br>yep still on the bronze thanks to <br>your LINKS that couln't be pased <br>up. I tried the first link, and <br>laughed way out loud. I clicked <br>on "purchasing" then on <br>"cravings online" to order my tim <br>tams. It then said that they are <br>no longer in service, at whcih <br>point I thought you must have <br>sent me a wonderfully elaborate <br>joke. It said I could email them <br>so I did. I sent them a VERY <br>rude email, thinking the whole <br>thing was just a joke anyway.<br><br>Um, I've looked closer now at <br>the site, and, um, its not a joke.<br><br>Some company out there has <br>just received the worst email I've <br>ever sent.<br><br>Oh well.<br><br>Thanks for the links!!!!<br><br>

<dd>littlewiggins:<br>OK I was gonna wait and let <br>people post, maybe sign off for <br>the evening (hoping ~mere~ and <br>Greenwalt and whover else <br>might pop up (I don't KNOW I'd <br>just like to see others pop in <br>thats all)) but I have to respond <br>to littlewiggins.<br><br>To use better language, I am <br>EXTREMELY JEALOUS of you <br>because you have Tim Tams in <br>your fridge and I don't. That's <br>all!!!<br><br>So, I'm not upset, just...just,,, <br>um,,, crying.<br><br>Santa Monica here I come. <br>(sung to the tune of "come on <br>PBP 2003").

<dd>kc: us Aussies all grew up, and <br>are still growing up, on it. <br>Americans grow up on Peanut <br>Butter & Jelly. Aussie kids not <br>only eat vegemite sandwiches <br>like there's no tomorrow, but are <br>also CALLED "little vegemites".<br><br>BUT: it tastes NOTHING like <br>peanut butter & Jelly, its just that <br>it is that famous and popular. <br>Probably tastes more like <br>insects than vegetables in your <br>question. Its black, it stinks, its <br>wicked, its wonderful.<br><br>little wiggins, OK right now you <br>are, and I say this lovingly, <br>pissing me off!<br><br>Aussiebulldog: OK then!! Bring <br>on 2003!!!<br><br>Archaic: <br>1)I'd rewrite all the star wars <br>movies. They sound fantastic <br>and I'd somehow write it the <br>exact same way (yeah right) and <br>experience all that fame and <br>fortune. Really though, I just <br>wish I could write like that!!<br><br>2)I watched a little, but not all the <br>time.<br><br>3)Amber is GREAT.<br><br>4)A what???!<br><br>slayerdaddy: well the song is <br>talking about what happens IN <br>the land downunder, so I don't <br>chunder so much now, and its <br>the women that glow.<br><br>

<dd>ducky,<br><br>Not ignoring you and it WAS <br>funny! I just couldn't think of a <br>funny response. Thanks for the <br>compliment!<br><br>Mab: see ya there! Wow its a <br>long way to come. Dedication <br>plus!<br><br>slayerdaddy: good call. There's <br>a LOT of stuff they don't have. I'll <br>have to call and check if they <br>have tim tams. But Fruchocs, <br>mate are THEY hard to get. <br>(Apricot and pear mixed together <br>and covered in chocolate).<br><br>Wow, look at the time, I should <br>be watching Angel.<br><br>

<dd>If I have my way, EVERYONE will <br>bring vegemite: No admission <br>without vegemite OR Tim Tams.<br><br>don't worry Christopher Marlowe: <br>Tim Tams are nothing like the <br>black stuff. They're a chocolate <br>biscuit. I'd say "cookies" but <br>cookies aren't the same. <br>Imagine two crispy cookies <br>layerd, with choclate all over and <br>in between. Smooth Aussie <br>chocolate at that.<br><br>Any other Aussies coming? they <br>can bring CHERRY RIPES! If <br>anyone from SA is coming, I am <br>also in DIRE need of <br>FRUCHOCS which are sold <br>nowhere else except SA.<br><br>Skip, Schoolnik, Angel <br>Co-Producer, asked me for a <br>vegemite sandwich last season. <br>He tried it right in front of me. He <br>not only survived but said he <br>liked it. That was about 9 <br>months ago, however, and he <br>hasn't asked for another one.<br><br>
