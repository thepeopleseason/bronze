<dd>Morning Buffites *yawn*. Nice PBP last night. Everyone was So friendly and fun. I had some really great conversations. Kudos to you all for organizing such a great event. I'll see those of you who didn't make it next year! I'm told I get lots of questions on the board that I don't see - if you want, E-mail them to me and I'll post the answers if you ask me to. Have a great Valentine's weekend. Todd<br>

The PBP went well (except for when ~mere~ -- well I'll let someone else break that news)...<br>
<br>
OK -- Popcorn break.<br>
