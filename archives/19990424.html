<DD>last post<BR>
Angela - hey<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - Jane sez no comment, please contact our PR representative<BR>
<BR>
Hey Beth, see below, I write the score<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - the real answer - yes, all the time.  She sometimes lets me steal a theme or two from time to time... I won't say which ones though.<BR>
<BR>
ok bye

<DD>OK second-to-last post, Thai Food calling<BR>
<BR>
Not-so-new - I write all the background music for the episodes.  And I forgive you for the typo<BR>
<BR>
Hi Jennie<BR>
<BR>
Peace Fire - Yes, I start in mid-summer<BR>
<BR>
New Girl - I want to but... there is none.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - I understand completely, don't worry<BR>
<BR>
Ha, I went to college with Jennofer Connelly (never met her though)<BR>
<BR>
Hey, and guess what - one of the cast members I've yet to meet is Kristine Sutherland, and she lives two houses down from me round the corner - we share a fair amount of backyard fence even.  <i>Still</i> I haven't met her.

see this is "can't stay long"<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer - what, tell you here in public?  VT knows.  (Does that count as a shoutout?)<BR>
<BR>
wolfguard - ?<BR>
<BR>
SealedNFate, Sarah W - Hard to compare - they're pretty different.  G1&2 (as it will certainly be abbreviated) is a huge huge big & exciting show.  Tons of visual effects too.  I've got one scene where I score two minutes of various backdrops with "VFX to be added later" writen across the bottom.<BR>
<BR>
Carita - Hi back to Ron.<BR>
<BR>
Gregg, New Girl - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Isobel - hi<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - her back is OK.  Time will tell.  She thanks you for asking.

<DD><BR>
Jane/wife sez I am a "posting board nut."<BR>
<BR>
LW - Yes you should write TVT if you feel strongly about score on the CD.  I know that they're still far from determining the final lineup and ya never know...<BR>
<BR>
New Person - I'm actually more under or over than on the show.<BR>
<BR>
Av - Not sure about the Earshot score in mp3... maybe eventually.<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo - OK, my e addy is above drop a line and remind me<BR>
<BR>
BtVS chick - all of em.

<DD>Carita - Hey there, me too.<BR>
<BR>
Kugel - your check is in the mail<BR>
<BR>
wolfguard - LOL - in college we used to have a theater called Cinema 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8; we just called "one too many"<BR>
<BR>
HeyNew Girl, are you also New Person?  Feeling unsure? :)</SMALL>

Hey WinterRain, PeaceFire,<BR>
<BR>
AngelLover24-7 - Bummer about your school.  <BR>
<BR>
I just started working on the finale.  They gave me two whole weeks... seems like an eternity.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - LOL on my having a cameo in the ep.  I'm sure I'd be in the trenches with all of you demanding that it be aired.  Hehe.

<DD><BR>
Slayed Soul - hmm... intriguing... <BR>
<BR>
Avarice - Not likely.  I think it will air eventually, and besides, it takes almost as long to adapt existing music to a new scene as it is to write new music.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Willow-, SealedNFate<BR>
<BR>
Thanks BtVSChick<BR>
<BR>
LW - LOL, dun dun is my favorite part<BR>
<BR>
Jimbo - Haven't seen your drawing but I've got the Buffy mag at my studio - I'll check it out.<BR>
<BR>
I have no idea what the plans are to air Earshot eventually or not.  I strongly believe it will be shown this summer.<BR>
<BR>
FASTEDITH - No problem.  I don't know how Joss feels about the preemption.
