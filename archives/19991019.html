Well, this has been active, but I have to go to bed now!<BR>
<BR>
I'm glad that most of you seem to have enjoyed the ep!  It's one of my favorites.  <BR>
<BR>
Good night!

Horizen, If you look back you can see my comments on Buffy's reaction to Parker.  In short, I said "she's human" -- I think we all react badly to unexpected rejection -- she liked a guy who didn't like her back.  It hit her fast and it hurt... much, you see, like Spike's punch.  She reacted with her human bits, not her Slayer bits.

Oh holy crap!<BR>
I just looked at what I wrote earlier and I said that Joss "added very little to the ep."  Criminy!  That's not what I meant!  I meant that he didn't change too many of my lines - Of course he was absolutely intrumental in every way!!  Oh, I'm deeply embarrased.

Gosh... so many things to defend!  I'm tired so I'll try to do it fast.<BR>
<BR>
Buffy all wimpy:  If she can deal with every problem easily there's no show.  It would get boring to watch her kick various butts without getting to live though her emotional highs and lows... and for that you need lows.  She's got super strength, but her heart is as fragile as any of ours.<BR>
<BR>
Angel rescuing only women... hmm... interesting point about which I can't think of anything to say.<BR>
<BR>
Endings of the eps seeming "off"  Gosh, I hope not.  I know the final shot of Buffy never looked exactly like we wanted... the point was supposed to be three different women all in the same emotional place due to bumps in the road to love.  Did that not come through?<BR>
<BR>
Spike all wimpy:  You're kidding, right?  He fought, he yelled, he abused his girlfriend, he tortured a guy... seemed scary to me!<BR>
<BR>
Okay... that's all I can do.

Broad daylight on campus and no one saw anything... yeah, but what can you do?  We needed it to be right after the Parker rejection, which we wanted to be semi-public... then the fight takes Buffy and Spike around a corner into less-populous spot.<BR>
<BR>
The puppy lines?  Joss.  Joss.  Joss.  He adds very little to the ep, and of course his lines are the ones everyone loves. -- It's that darn genius thing of his.<BR>
"Still more romantic than Faith" -- Me. Me. Me!

You say that James was uncredited?  Hmm.  I think maybe you're right.   James was not credited tonight... if so, I'm certain it was to preserve the end-of-act-one reveal of Spike... for everyone who hadn't seen his face in the endless promos!<BR>
<BR>
Harmony and Spike... clearly not a love relationship like he had with Dru... but I think you can see that he considers her worth a dalliance... she's a pretty girl and seems to be up for a good time!

I'm sorry that people found Buffy too naive in her reaction to Parker.  I understand your point, but I will remind you that she was taken very much by surprise by his rejection -- and that even though she was, to a certain extent, using him to try to get over Angel, she still GENUINELY liked the guy.  We all know hard it is when you like someone who doesn't like you back.  Even once you learn that they're scum, you still wonder why they don't like you.<BR>
Thanks for all the nice comments, too!  Glad to see you enjoyed Spike -- isn't he a big blond bundle of fun?

<b>chi:</b>  Thanks!  But try not to slap so hard next time, OK?  lol  Cool on the Astro Van!  (FYI, that is the Velvet Chain gig vehicle.  Jeff's Astro Van.)  I think the Diva Icon and Dr. Evil make a very good pair!

<DD>Super-quick post to say TODAY IS A GREAT DAY!!  =)  I mean, I get to see <b>Spike</b> for TWO WHOLE HOURS tonight, plus the Buffy Soundtrack and VC's Buffy EP are sitting all pretty-like in stores across the country!  I am indeed a fortunate lass.  =)
