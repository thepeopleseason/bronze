bec - hee hee, I'm trying to cut down, so lack of candy bars is a plus in my book<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - I agree with you, your mind is gone<BR>
<BR>
OK, I don't really get to see Jeff and Charisma, uhh, ever.  (The first time I met Jeff was at the PBP!)  So I probably can't pass on your messages... sorry...<BR>
<BR>
LouWho - I've never met Mark Snow.  I was hoping to meet him at the Emmys so I could tell him how much of a fan I am.  Which is to say huge.  (Though it may not have gone over so good once our category was announced... )   Prolific would be an understatement...<BR>
<BR>
Hey, whirlwind, sara the brown<BR>
<BR>
I'm off, my mom's in town, she wants to visit the set...  we'll see how much pull I have now.<BR>

<BR>
thanks Clattering<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - OK, looking forward to it.  And let me try... "mass chaos".  Did I get it?  Did I get it?<BR>
<BR>
-mere- Your music boy Mr. Hoenig is doing a mighty fine job over there in SW land - I particularly enjoyed the pilot (not just the score, the whole shebang).  The theme, too.  A little on the odd side but very cool.

Carita - Past Perfect stars Eric Roberts.  It's a time-travel-cop-gratuitous-gunfire-and-explosions type of thing.  I got into trouble recently (up at Sundance) for dissing this movie at a party, not realizing that the producer, who had changed her hair enough that I didn't recognize her, was within earshot.  It was the first film I ever scored and I look back on the project fondly.  Not sure I'd encourage you to rush out and rent it though.  And Julia, if you're on the board, well, I didn't diss it as bad this time did I?<BR>
<BR>
(Julia,please don't be on the board)</SMALL>

Not usually a morning person but I thought I'd jump in here...<BR>
<BR>
MeeB, Circe - there *will* be a third season promo CD, probably sometime in late summer.  I don't make enough to give a whole bunch out (they're really for promotional purposes only) but I'll be sure to send one to Sarah W (assuming she lasts that long as CBCC site queen) for uploading.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for saying such nice things about the music...<BR>
<BR>
samantha - you saw Past Perfect?  Di you like it?
