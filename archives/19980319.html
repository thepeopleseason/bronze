AngleMan: If you watch the episoe with the Judge, my speech to Aly in the (notorious) van, about 'to the casual observer...' that scene, dialoge, theoretical background, etc sums up all that I believe is Oz, and I want to explore that.<br>
Sasheer: I'm very proud of my detention on 90210...<br>
Melanie: re the Natural Childbirth...I'm not sure, I'd have to consult my mother<br>
Aug: i don't think it was me, but my memory is pretty short.<br>
To all...Alas, I must depart...sleep and warm food awaits me. Thanks for the hospitality, and have a great weekend.<br>

Hi to Cynthia sorry you couldn't join in our reigndeer games...<br>
Spence: Lots of different people are responsible for my hair, colorists, and the show's stylists, secret agents, and rock musicians<br>
Daphmax:Thanks for the kindness towards 'Byrds' hawaii was a great experience, as was working on a series. I have learned lots that I will keep in mind next season.<br>
irishGirl: I'll make the 'sleep vs post' decision easy (I hope) - I have to go, I recommend (hey Seth, easy on the ego) sleep.<br>
BradGenz:Idle Hands is supporting, Stonebrook is the stuff actor's dreams are made of<br>
Lothos: Re- wolf in the finale...it is futile to ask<br>

Hey TV James...<br>
Horizon: very sorry to hear about Psyche's accident, but flattered by her methods of cheering up...scroll down to the red to see the S.O.<br>
AngleMan: Re - next season...it's all kept very secret even from me, but I trust (and expect) from Joss, it'll be something we'll all enjoy<br>
Sasheer: sorry if you all felt slighted last week, I found myself erstwhile occupied. Consider my posting my attempt at restitution.<br>
Melanie: I am supposed to be getting some pictures that I may be able to send you...<br>

&gt;Sorry for the delay, my fancy high tech server decided I'd spent enough time online<br>
Melanie&amp;Sasheer: Glad you liked the Cibil, I was kind of hoping it would go unnoticed<br>
DestructoGirl:Sleep is a good thing<br>
Psyche: a solicited shout out to you<br>
OzFan: nice name...I have no ideas off the top of my head for guest stars, but I'd welcome anyone that comes to play with us<br>
DrStrangepants: Toy Scott is the best, True Romance is one of my favorites as well. My scenes are with Jaime kennedy, jack Black, and Body Elfman<br>
Banana: I have small bits in both parts of the season ender<br>
BradGenz: I'm busy all summer doing two movies- Idle Hands and an independant called Stonebrook <br>

<dd><STRONG>Angle Man - - Sorry, but I have made two oaths to myself - First, that for the rest of my life, I shall judge no man. And, second, that I shall torment poor <STRONG>TB to the ends of hell.</p>
<br>
So, how am I doing?</p>
<br>
<I>"TeddiBear, Teddibear<br>
I done you wrong<br>
Teddibear, Teddibear<br>
I see that now, and I'm sorry."</I><br>
<br>
Hey, take your pick: nice or rhyming, but not both at the same time.<br>

<I>"The Poster Formerly Known as TB<br>
Thinks the new name's fooling me<br>
You attempts to elude me will be for naught<br>
Because you know that when you're caught<br>
I'll beg forgiveness, take me back<br>
Tuberculosis turns lungs black."</I><br>
<br>
Sorry, but I swear I couldn't think of anything else to rhyme with "take me back." You believe me, don't you?<br>

Or...<br>
<br>
<I>"I have lots of toys<br>
That share my bed<br>
Lambs and monkeys<br>
Around my head<br>
But my teddy bear<br>
I hold the closest<br>
Cause he's dying of<br>
Tuberculosis."</I><br>

Is any of this doing the trick, <STRONG>TB?<br>

Ahem... a poem about <STRONG>Alex<br>
<br>
<I>"Goddess. Vision. Heaven sent.<br>
Miracle. Source of wonderment.<br>
Through evening wafts, as if on air<br>
The answer to this poor board's prayer<br>
The multi-colored prose she weaves<br>
The many broken hearts she leaves<br>
We sigh and fall under her spell<br>
That damned elusive Pimpernel<br>
An angel of the hours late<br>
The words she writes intoxicate<br>
We, helpless ask, what is her story?<br>
Our PB Queen<br>
Our TV Lori"</I><br>
<br>
And... bowing to her constant pleading, here is a poem about TB...<br>
<br>
<I>"Coughing at the bathroom sink<br>
Spitting projectiles of pink<br>
Something flecks the bathroom mirror<br>
I can't make out, so I lean nearer<br>
'Tis bits of lung that polka dot<br>
The last stage of the foul plague's rot<br>
As arms convulse, and fingers twitch<br>
Tuberculosis, what a bitch"</I><br>
<br>
<STRONG>TB <U>did</U> say her posting board name stands for Tuberculosis, didn't she, <STRONG>Roanna and <STRONG>Brad Grenz?<br>
<br>
Okay, discuss...<br>
