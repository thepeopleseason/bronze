<DD>bec:  Those were David and Seth's words when I gave them those huge boxes of cakes.  "Hey Pruitt, what's up with the missing cakes?"  Good Lord.  Is it possible that they can really eat all of that?<BR>
<BR>
Cate:  Our transpo captain buys'em and we smash'em.<BR>
<BR>
Guess I'll take off now since Sophia is back and watch Buffy myself.  <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for talking with me and take care everyone.

<DD>Kaoru - They are less safe and that is something they are trying to learn about over here.  Many deaths on those films.  That was one of the things Stanley and I talked about.  We are hoping to produce a special on East meets West Stunts.  In fact, tomorrow is our meeting with the CBS honchos about it so wish us luck.   They already admit that Buffy is their fave show, they just don't want to promote it.  They want to promote Martial Law and Walker.  I guess we'll see what the outcome is later on that.  I'll be doing something on it though.   Something nasty I'm sure.

<DD>Labrynth - Sure.  No problem.<BR>
<BR>
FSM CD Man - I love thouse CDs.  Thank you so much.  I was even blasting out the Buffy theme at work today while I was with the director of the next episode looking at sets.  He thinks I'm nuts.<BR>
<BR>
Whim - Joss does not allow us to undercrank to speed up the action.  I have done it only with the Faith character because her kicks were not as fast as Sophia's and there was a little pause going on in between the movements.  I did try it with Sophia and Joss asked me not to do it again.  She's way fast enough.<BR>
<BR>
So when you watch Sammo Hung or Jackie Chan or Jet Li you'll know that they are speeding it up using the camera.   We can't do that with our Buffy.  What you see is the real deal with her.<BR>
<BR>
btw - I spent 3 hours alone with Stanley Tong (the producer of Martial Law and director of SUPERCOP & RUMBLE IN THE BRONX)  He didn't believe that we were that fast either till I jumped up and showed him.  Now he knows too. ;p

<SMALL>(Tue Feb  9 19:45:27 1999 169.132.153.100)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Meeb & KrazyKat - All of the stunts on tonights episode I've used on Buffy before.  The final spin and crash onto the box was in the "hellfight."  Joss and I had talked about moving the camera around to shoot it properly that day, but we didn't have the time.  Since Joss liked it I put it the warehouse at the end and had the same stuntman (Chris O'Hara) do it again.  He told me later that he dug it.<BR>
<BR>
The one thing that was different was the bit where Angel throws the guy into a side spin.  Normally I call it a Hong Kong Spin (because Jackie Chan did it first) but the HK guys call it a 720.   This time I wrapped a wire around Lee Whitaker (the Oz Stunt Double here playing a Vamp) and gave him a couple of extra turns in order to show how strong this Angel dude can be.  I felt that he needed to really wallop somebody since he hasn't done that in a while.<BR>
<BR>
Hey you stuntgo! - Sophia luved the shirt.  I showed mine to Joss and he lughed outloud at the quote on the back.

<DD>wolfguard - We've done trapping, but it has to be shot a certain way in order to really see and appreciate it.  So far we have not had time to do that.  We are always in a rush and having to compromise.  That's just how tv is most of the time.<BR>
Joss likes Slo-Mo for very specific things.  I'll see if he feels there is a place for it in some future episode.  I do have many new things I'd like to do that we have not done before and one of them involves a bit of that.<BR>
<BR>
Mabb - Sophia did the action, but Sarah did have to put her head under the water too.  It was not too pleasant to have a guy holding her head under that way.  She stayed down so long I started to get worried.  But she was only playing.<BR>
<BR>
Drufan - Sorry.  I don't know that one.

<DD>Charlie X - Don't look at me or wish me into the cornfield or anything like that.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Lover 24-7:  Sometimes a producer or director will come up with something that I know will not work and I try to do it a different way (like a way in which the stunt person gets to live at the end)  but it's Sophia's job and she likes to do it.<BR>
<BR>
CynLil:  Giles is out...standing in his field.  Y'know?<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - I heard they just changed, but I don't have the new codes yet.  I guess my name is still protected though.  Try to type my name and see if that part is still working.  Okay?

<DD>Bruces Mom:  Around the set we all called him Jabba anyway.  (I won't mention some of the other names that we've given other characters - not fit for tender eyes to read)<BR>
<BR>
Karen Sheperd is the Faith stunt double.  I brought her to the PBP for a little while then I had to take her home.  She did get to meet a few PB folks though.

<DD>A Polite Newbie:  Thanks - you should be getting your Buffy E.P. within a day or so.  I'll bet you $100 you dig it.<BR>
Asanti:  Hi. Thanks for the complement.. The PBP was a really fun show.  And yes, I think we sufficiently rocked.  It's great when it's your JOB to ROCK.  Sign me up.<BR>
Devil:  Hey, thanks. <BR>
Slay Me:  Thank you too.  I like the Bronze.  My problem is I never have enough time for anything, so, unfortunately, I don't make it into the Bronze that often.  It's a nice place though.

<DD>Hi Drufan and Cherie.  Well, things are pretty good now.  I have a little breathing space now that the E.P. is out.  I almost didn't get it done in time for the PBP.  I actually picked them up from the CD plant on the Friday night before. It was a close one.  So now I have a little breather.  I even have time to post! wow.

<DD>I so have to be leaving, but I can't help myself...<BR>
<BR>
I am so embarrassed by this!  OK, here's the deal.  I want no credit.  I did nothing.  All I did was make a few calls, leave a couple messages, and deliver a few invites.  And I asked Seth to grease the wheels and make sure everyone knew he was playing, and that there'd be a VIP area for the actors, etc.  Truthfully, according to more than one actor, they did not know about the party as of 5 days beforehand. Maybe they forgot, but that's what they said.  So, I'm just glad we all got the nice turnout we did, for whatever reason.  Please, stop thanking me, 'cause I don't want anyone taking offense and the PBP committee did SOOOOOO much for the party and deserve tons of thanks, etc.  OK?  Cool!  =)<BR>
