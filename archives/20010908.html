<dd>Little miss muffet:  Currently learning Money and Wish You Were Here.  Man, do I suck.  Nu skool punk?  It’s all rock n’ roll to me.<br><br>The Angel E:  The Halloween ep’s going great.  For the love of Joss, avoid the spoilers on this one!  Don’t even read the TV guide!  <br><br>White Wings:  The Halloween ep is prepping to shoot Thursday.  We’re casting right now, and all is golden.<br><br>@lex H:  We were robbed!  Robbed I say!  I was particularly surprised that The Body wasn’t nominated.  Well, at least Sorkin will get another Emmy.  Gosh he’s such a nice a guy – he really deserves it.  I’m sure all his well-treated writers agree.<br><br>Thoin:  I’ll never reveal the secret of the wooden shoes.  Never!<br><br>Newt:  I don’t remember.<br><br>MSU:  Love is never easy.<br><br>JaClaS:  Yes.  Witchcraft is bad.  Girls who believe in it or attempt to practice it will be punished by being forced to deep-kiss beautiful, talented women.  Take that, you witch!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Respond seriously?  Why, it goes against everything I stand for (or sit, as the case may be).<br><br>Xanderella:  Hugs and pokes right back at you.<br><br>Tennis7723:  Never count a military man down.  That’s all I’m saying.<br><br>Abt:  All the above would be grand.  Defend me and build me robots?  Not quite what I had in mind, but heck, why not?<br><br>Slayerdaddy:  It’s my pig now, baby!  Oink oink!<br><br>Cashmere:  You got it right the first time. ;)<br><br>Undead:  Xander and Anya – hey, wait a minute!  I can’t ell you that!<br><br><br>And on that mean little note, I gotta go caress my Ibanez.  (Guitar – get your minds out of the gutter.)  As always, hugs and pokes till I return next week.<br><br>poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>@lex H:  Not sure what other eps I'm writing this season.  All depends where I land when my number comes up.<br><br>abt:  Nope, never been to the UK.  Would love a UK girl though.  Put the word out for me, will ya?  A nice martial artist/scientist would be great, thanks.<br><br>jamie poole:  Only time for short answers: 1)  Ours are cooler (and a lot sexier). 2) Coolness.  3) No.  But I have met a few blood-sucking producers.  4) Extra coolness.  And a lack of the just plain silly.<br><br>DowntownApartments:  Mya, without a doubt.  Grrrrr!  Yeah, I shaved the goat.  I'll have to send Tiggy a pic so you can decide whether I look better with or without.  But thanks for the sucking.  Always appreciated.<br><br>cashmere:  Spike's affection for Dawn sure seems genuine, doesn't it?  Then again it might just be an evil plot to get her into a pair of wooden shoes.<br><br>cain16:  Never fear.  They'll be plenty of darkness to go around.  Lots of funny too.  I think we're going to strike just the right balance.<br><br>Boo:  Good to hear from you!  Yeah, as soon as I take some nekkid face pics I'll e them to you.  and as always, thanks for the great work on DeKnight's Riders.  All hail Boo!<br><br>Nofetsur: No idea.  I came in after MB's final ep had already been written.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Yeah, I go to the Shakespeare readings.  I'm usually Third Guard From the Left.<br><br>The Frog Man:  Not sure about any of the DVD stuff.  I wasn't involved in it, since I didn't join up till mid season 5.<br><br>wolfdog:  Hope you make it the next one.<br><br>Okay, one more round, then I gotta go practice the guitar.  That Pink Floyd won't learn itself!<br><br>

<dd>Isis:  Okay, uh... Halloween.  That's it so far.  I don't come back into the rotation until around ep 13.<br><br>BiteMeGirl:  They're recording the tracks for the musical now.  It's going to be one of the most amazing things you'll ever see on TV.  All hail Joss and his big pulsating talent!  As for me, I recently finished polishing up the Halloween ep and Monday I'll start on my second animated ep.<br><br>Nofestur:  I have no idea.  I'll have to ask Those Who Know.<br><br>Slayergrl:  Hmm... What kind of costume?  I'm thinking of a particular one.  If you guess it on the first try, the shirt's yours.<br><br>Algerina:  Hmm.  Seems to be a costume theme today.  If I had to pick, it'd be a pirate.  Arhhh!<br><br>slayerdaddy:  Haven't actually seen any of the Buffy crowd's movies this summer.  I'm waiting for Scooby Doo.  Or anything Eliza shows up in.<br><br>newt:  Haven't heard anything about Amber writing an episode.  The apocalypse always happens in Sunnydale due to budget restraints.  No, I mean the Hellmouth!  It's the Hellmouth!<br><br>Joey Emma:  Keep out of the booze till you're 21 (in the US, anyway).  As for pants...<br><br>DowntownApartments:  Get out of that Entertainment Weekly! Bad girl, bad!  That goes for the rest of you too.  Trust me:  you DON'T want any of the surprises spoiled this season.<br><br>SHAMELESS TIGGY PLUG:  I see the flow of photos coming into DeKnight's Flying Butt Monkeys has dried up.  Break out those cameras, people!  Uncle Stevie wants a peek!  Send Tiggy your photos!<br><br>

<dd>Molly:  Climb aboard. Next stop: excitement and regurgitation.<br><br>Joey Emma:  Halloween ep groovin' along.  We're casting it now, and it starts shooting Thursday.  Spooky creepy sexy.  Yup.  Just like me.  As for the Kuzuis, they were producers on the feature film, so they're "silent" producers on the show.  Never seen them, never met them.  Hear they make a mean mai tai.<br><br>

<dd>SlayerDaddy:  Absolutely true.  He also kept playing the "Singing in the Rain" section of A Clockwork Orange over and over, although none of us are quite sure why.<br><br>

<dd>Didn't think I'd forget you, did you?  That meeting lasted all day on Friday -- much breakage on ep 9.  <br><br>It's laundry and lunch for me right now, so you got me for about an hour.  Put 'em up!  Put 'em up!<br><br>
