<dd>OK, I have to run.  Errands to do, etc.  I will be checking my e-mail all during the day, though, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you want those free tickets!  =)  (If anyone's thinking about coming tonight, be sure to contact me by 3pm, OK?)<br><br>~Erika<br><br>

<dd><b>Hollyn:</b>  Yeah, by 1pm should still be fine.  It's on Sepulveda between Santa Monica and Olympic, on the West side of the street.  We're in Theatre 2.  But keep in  mind, it's a Preview!  You'll be our very first audience EVER.  =)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>roja!</b><br><br>The new album (Asteroid Belt) is being mastered as we speak!  Like, right this second, Jeff's at the mastering studio.  =)  The album will be all done and released before Christmas, and I believe we're planning on accepting pre-orders for it starting on Nov. 7th.  Cool, huh?  ;-)<br><br>As for touring, we would <i>love</i> to, but we'll need an influx of cash to make that happen, so it's really a wait-and-see kind of situation.  If we can make it work, though, we will definitely tour at some point to support the album.  =)<br><br>
