<DD>turtle: You do know of course that you can't believe anything I tell you about what's coming up.  Spike dying, Spike moving to Angel, Spike making Xander his little love monkey -- some of these might be true, some of them might not.  But let me ask you this -- if we were going to kill Spike in the season finale, don't you think I'd deny it?  He he he he he....<BR>
<BR>
And with that I must vanish into the deep dark night.  As usual, I'll try to stop back Friday and rattle your cages.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, where's the Red Hood?  Somebody kiss her monkey for me.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Librarian:  No research neccessary.  The only episode I've done that's aired is season 5, #13 - Blood Ties.  My next one, #20 - Spiral - airs on May 8.<BR>
<BR>
Shameless Plug:  Run out and buy the new Buffy mag.  Great interviews with Rebecca Kirshner and Superfly Steve DeKnight.  Buy it, or I'll send Fury to your house to smack you around!  Smack smack!

<DD>Maeve:  Who doesn't love Star Wars?  Although I have to admit I wasn't that pleased with Phantom Menace.  Trade blockade?  Zzzzzzzz.  Wake me when the Clone Wars start up.

<DD>Pippistrellbat:  Yes, Christine was and is an amazing actress and her character of Joyce was muched loved on the show.  But that's exactly what makes Buffy so different.  Joyce died because in real life, that's what happens.  It's gut-wrenching and depressing and it hurts like hell.  Anyone that has ever lost a parent knows how close to the bone "The Body" cuts.  It was the most riveting, brave episode of television I've ever seen.  Joyce will be missed, but because of Joss' brilliant decsion on how she died, she will always be remembered.<BR>
<BR>
Tiggy3323:  Save those pennies, baby!  I will definitely be at the PBP 2002.  <BR>
<BR>
Molly:  I already have a team of yokels to do my dirty work.  But in regards to the Animated Buffy, Joss' crackerjack people at Mutant Enemy are busy scouring the land for the best and brightest to work on the show.  'Cause you know, us Buffy writers will be concentrating on doing our Buffy thang.  (That's right.  I said "thang," sucka!)<BR>
<BR>
Kiba Rika:  I'll stop by.  As for Fury, yeah, he tried to ring my bells a couple of times at the party last night.  Saucy bastard.

<DD>Librarian:  I shall attack him wih plastic spoons.  No, Joss pretty much nailed it.  When he doesn't like something, he tells us straight out.  He'll usually throw in a joke jab here and there to punctuate his point.  But no matter how brutal the notes are, we always leave the room knowing that Joss loves and treasures our work on the show, and anything he says is geared to making us better writers.  He's the best film school in the world.  Why, if he weren't married...<BR>
<BR>
Seana:  You are correct.  Buffy does rock.  And occassionaly rolls.<BR>
<BR>
Allyson:  Okay, put 'em up!  Put 'em up!  KRAtolerance!  OUCH!  All right!  I'll join Fury's Fanatics!  Just quit hitting me!<BR>
<BR>
FiathSummer:  Welcome to the board.  Make sure you wipe your feet before entering.  And wash your hands when you leave (just in case).<BR>
<BR>
turtle: Spike, huh?  Want to know what happens?  Well, see, Glory -- hey, wait a minute!  Your Jedi mind tricks won't work on this fella!  These aren't the droids we're looking for!  Move along!<BR>
<BR>
Janni:  Thanks.  I've always dreamed of being more loved than laundry.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah's Carl:  I was from a wee little town called Millville, about an hour northwest of Atlantic City.  A bleak, depressing factory town.  Now I live in the land of mlik and sweet, sweet honey!<BR>
<BR>
By the way, somebody asked about the weather.  It's in the mid seventies and gorgeous here in Los Angeles.  For all of you in Jersey -- get out while you still can!

<DD>Tiggy 3323:  Boo's kinda disappeared.  So yeah, fly on in and hose me down.<BR>
<BR>
As for the strike, things aren't looking good.  The writers are angry (rightly so), the actors are angry (rightly so), and the Companies are acting like they don't care if we go on strike or not.  Not a good situation.  <BR>
<BR>
Jipsy Girl:  Aw, shucks.  I'm blushing.<BR>
<BR>
TJ:  Info on Tara?  Yeah.  She does a little magic.  Makes a little love.  Gets down tonight.  Besides that, Amber is the sweetest gal you'd ever want to meet.  Can't wait to see her movie.<BR>
<BR>
General Character Stuff:  If I could take credit for creating one character, it'd have to be Joss Whedon.  Sadly, I couldn't dream up a character like him in a million years. <BR>
<BR>
Which charcter do I enjoy writing for the most?  All of them, honestly.  <BR>
<BR>
laffin: James moving to Buffy?  Over my dead body!  Actually no, he's not.  There was some talk awhile ago, but we have too many plans for him on Buffy.  Oh, you guys are going to love what's coming up.  One little hint:  Spike.  Xander.  Strange Love.<BR>
<BR>
Molly:  Funny you should ask.  Yes, the Buffy writers will be penning a couple of episodes of the Animated Buffy.  We're just starting to work on that now.  And since daytime animation isn't covered by the WGA, I can keep working on it even if there's a strike.  <BR>
<BR>
longtimelurker:  I believe Joss would love another uninterrupted season of Buffy, but from what I've gathered he does support the strike.  Not surprising, since he is first and foremost a writer -- and one of the best in the world.

<DD>Janni:  You be correct, they be wrong.  Dawn was not trying to kill herself.  Her whole point was that she bleeds, therefore she is real.  If anything, this was a metaphore for "secret cutting" and not for suicide.<BR>
<BR>
Narrator: The party was amazing.  Everything I always dreamed about growing up in the sticks in New Jersey.  Not to get too gushy, but the people I work with - from Joss and Marti and the writers all the way to crew and even the security guards - are the best in the world.  <BR>
<BR>
Rikki:  My ass thanks you.  Seriously.<BR>
<BR>
Tiggy3323:  Doing grrrrr-reat!  How about you?<BR>
<BR>
Joe the Owl:  He was part of the crew on the show.  I believe he died of a terminal illness right before I joined the team.  From what I've heard, he was a wonderful man and will be sorely missed.

<DD>Joe the Owl: Season Six?  Sure, why not?  We don't know what network we'll be on, but yes, there will definitely be a season six.  Can't give anything away, but it's going to be amazing.  We're all very excited to start working on it.  Now if we can just get past that pesky strike...<BR>
<BR>
Rikki:  I'm impressed you remembered my Superfly.  Right on!<BR>
<BR>
TJ:  I know many things.  For example, nine out of ten writers misuse the word nonplussed.  Kids, don't make this mistake at home.

<DD>Howdy folks.  How goes it with the best fans in the world?<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of which, I read some of the posts concerning the little girl Cairo.  Everyone at the office was deeply touched by the compassion and support shown by the Bronzers.  Hats (and pants) off to you wonderful people.

<DD>Hey gang.  I'm not really here yet -- this is merely the ghost of DeKnight future.  Just wanted to let Storm know that the buzz in the office is that the new Buffy will be aired sometime over the following weekend for those stations that are screwed up by the baseball game.  Don't know if this a fact, but check it out.<BR>
<BR>
I'll be back in a couple of hours, oh, say, around one or two o'clock.<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*
