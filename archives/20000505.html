<DD>Last one...wanna get some sleep before the planets line up and kill us all or whatever! *g*<BR>
<BR>
Moriah: Hey, if I can be nekkid here, we ALL can be nekkid here. As for nekkid and gay? Not I. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's a valid lifestyle. God, I miss Seinfeld. *g* And I almost had dinner with Russell Crowe a couple years ago. See, my friend was DATING him...*eg*<BR>
<BR>
Angeloudi:Yeah! Nekkid Body Shots!<BR>
<BR>
Crimson: Same here!<BR>
<BR>
JoAnne: Hey there!<BR>
<BR>
Dalia: Thanks, but things were perfectly under control. She was very respectful! Hope you're well.<BR>
<BR>
Lilu: Me too! Mine has a propeller, though.<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: I miss you guys :(<BR>
<BR>
FSM: Come on down!<BR>
<BR>
BuBBle: Good to see you! I think we've met before (but I could be wrong).<BR>
<BR>
Sarah's carl: Have a good one!<BR>
<BR>
Ant: Have a nekkid good night! Amber SHOULD have colour (hell, I was only on Buffy for 4 seconds -no jokes, guys-) and I was just thinking...ALL the ladies of Buffy (and Angel) are EXTREME hotties (and very nice, too)!<BR>
<BR>
Here's to the ladies!<BR>
<BR>
Gotta jett like Boba Fett (without the whole Pit of Sarlaac part *g*)!<BR>

Witchy Woman: Good to see ya too! I haven't been here much since the PBP...probably cuz I no longer have a computer!<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: Tonight's my last time here for a while...I'm housesitting tonight so I have only temporary access. I miss my buds!<BR>

<DD>Amber IS quite the "hottie" (and good actress!) and I'm bummed that I didn't get to meet her at the PBP.<BR>
<BR>
Ant: Yes, you're correct, I'm quite nekkid...see I'm driving slowly by on a bicycle and, I don't know if you ever put baseball cards in your bicycle spokes...let's just say I'm driving slowly to avoid pain!<BR>
<BR>
Lupe: Thanks! <BR>
<BR>
blurred: No plans right now for overseas (love to, though). Trying to get known here in the States right at the moment but I'm sure it won't be too long...<BR>
<BR>
Angeloudi: Nekkid is goooooooood!<BR>
<BR>
Crimson: you have a fine sense of humour! *g*<BR>
<BR>
Moriah: Hiya! Are you nekkid too like the rest of us? *g* I think about all I can eat these days is baked chicken! *g* Gotta lay off the sweets.<BR>
<BR>
Anna: Hiya, I'm good and hope you're the same.<BR>
<BR>
