<DD>Little Willow:  by the way, I sent you a package yesterday with the manuscript (w/ handwritten copyedits, no less) for BODY BAGS.  Now I'm all nervous and paranoid that you won't like it.  : )<BR>

<DD>Hey Gregg, Ang, thanks for asking.  Things are good.  Looking forward to next week, when Gatekeeper 2 is released, and working on Sins of the Father, my solo Buffy novel (november).  Also, gearing up for the 
May release of the first book in my new YA mystery series for Pocket (first book is Body Bags), and, most importantly (trumpets sound--for me, at least), my new novel from Signet, STRANGEWOOD, which hits in August.  Geez, now I know why I'm so sleepy.</fo
