<dd>Hi, Nightspirit, hi Wolf, hi Twilight!<br><br>Evalie, we are about to start the machinery for my episode, so it's getting really close.<br><br>Slayergrl99: Wait.  You say that like there's something wrong with "Speed."<br><br>Taliesin: I have no doubt that it was DEEPLY profound and interesting.  Although, you know, profound and interesting sometimes scares me.  Sometimes I do better with shallow and fluffy.  But I am willing to stretch, so if you remember, I am totally here for you.<br><br>OldMan: Everyone dying at the end?  No.  Everyone dressing up like clowns and engaging in Cream Pie Frivolity at the end?  Hmmmm...MAYBE.<br><br>Irene:  Initiation?!?  What the... hey, I thought all that stuff with the paddle was just cos they all really LIKED me... damn...<br><br>tiggy: now, no jumping off into Niagra Falls to prove your point.  That NEVER works.<br><br>

<dd>tiggy: Yeah, it's weird how DeKnight and I are never in the same place at the same time, isn't it?  The season's a lot of fun so far, thanks!<br><br>Christopher Marlowe: What's this about DeKnight and his strong arms??  And, no, Episode 8 is the Lovlier-and-More-Talented-With-Every-Passing-Day Rebecca Kirshner, I'll be doing Episode 9.<br><br>Cash: Smiley, of course.  It's fun to watch their tiny little hopes get crushed.  Oh, wait, you mean the SNACK goldfish?  Then blank.<br><br>Hey, Paks, hey OldMan... all kinds of neat stuff going on.  Hints, hints, let's see... I hear there might be some demons.<br><br>DeAn: Thanks!  I had a BLAST doing the show, glad you enjoyed listening to us.  Yes, Kitty and Candy are awesome, and hmmm, cussword, cussword...I have no memory of what you could possibly mean...!<br><br>Allyson:  I ALWAYS got sugar for you, baby.  Extra fine granulated, even.<br><br>

<dd>Hello, my little goldfish.  Had a few minutes free, so I wanted to pop in and say howdy!  Howdy!<br><br>

<dd>valMichael:  We're shooting ep 4 right now (big Doug Petrie's directorial debut!!!)  I'm currently working on getting the Halloween ep ready to go.<br><br>speare:  Jeph Loeb is the man!  He's the head of the animated show, and second in command only to the mighty Joss.  Great guy, and a great guy to work with.  I believe he is cowriting the series debut ep with Joss.  Can't say enough good things about Jeph.<br><br>Cashmere: There will be much Spike rejoicing for you this season.  That's all I'm saying.<br><br>Thoin:  Thanks!  I'll do that!<br><br>DeAN:  I don't know what the feck you're talking about, man.  ;)<br><br>SlayerQueen:  I'll check out your pic.  I should send Tiggy a new one of me.  Recently shaved off the old goat for the ladies.<br><br>mandarb:  The script is pretty much locked when it starts filming.  After that, we usually only do minor changes if necessary.<br><br>Angus:  Steve McKnight thanks you, wherever he is.<br><br>ShyGirl:  Dark red?  Grrrrrr!<br><br>DowntownApartments:  Been too long.  Glad to have the chance to say howdy before I poof.  Howdy!<br><br>Okay, gotta run.  These arms aren't gonna get massive all by their wittle selves!  I'll drop back next week for some more of your sweet, sweet love.  Until then, treat each other like DeKnight would -- with hugs and pokes!  Poke poke!<br><br>

<dd>Zues:  Western.  Think Batman/Superman Adventures type of stuff.  Extra cool.<br><br>Thoin: Joss be verrrry busy.  That musical's not going to write itself!<br><br>Ophelia's Twin: After the first draft, Joss and Marti give notes.  Then we rewrite, give it back to them, get more notes, and so on till it's perfect.  The amount of changes varies from ep to ep. Sometimes we get it very close on the first shot, sometimes not so much.<br><br>@alex H:  Oh, yeah, now I remember.  Wooden shoes.  Nope, that's all I can tell you.  But I'm glad to see you're certified.  More people should make the effort.<br><br>DeAN:  I'll file the Tiggy undy info for nefarious use at a later date.  Music wise, I'm a fan across the board.  At the moment, I'm listening to Nikka Costa and Gorillaz (sp?).  Also a big fan of Pink Floyd, Ween, Radiohead, Beck, and Rob Zombie, to name a very few.<br><br>little miss muffet:  It's a kilt, I tells ya!  That's my story and I'm sticking to it!<br><br>Okay, last round then I'm off to the gym to sling the heavy iron.  Argggh!  Steve smash!<br><br>

<dd>newt:  Incredible Hulk ref.  Argggh!  Yeah, we all have our own cool offices at Buffy Central.  If I couldn't write on Buffy, I'd want to work on Charmed.  That Shannen Doherty is hot!<br><br><br>Kevin UK:  I'll be doing at least two eps, plus some animated shows and hopefully some comic book work.<br><br>ShyGirl:  Poke right back at ya!  What color are you dyeing your hair?  Gonna send a pic to Tiggy's site so we can all see?<br><br>Speaking of sweet Tiggy's site -- SEND HER YOUR PICS!  I still want to know what you all look like (for when you start stalking me).<br><br>SlayerQueen:  Tie me up with my own pants?  Yes, please.<br><br>Sarah's Carl: I'll pass that along.<br><br>@lex H:  Not sure how many eps Tony's going to do.  But you'll get some sweet Giles action before he dies -- uh, goes away.<br><br>

<dd>DeAN: Tiggy and I are very close.  We actually share underwear.  That's all I'm saying.<br><br>newt:  Nope, still looking for that ET finger.  Anybody out there got one?  We are working other religious icons into the vampire legend this season.  Buffy will start using throwing stars of David as her weapon of choice.<br><br>Vilia:  Couldn't be better.  Well, you know, unless Tiggy were here.<br><br>@lex H:  Uh... wooden shoes?  You'll need to refresh my old addled memory.<br><br>Zeus:  Things be good.  The animated show is starting to hum along.  It's going to be truly amazing.<br><br>Impaler General:  Working for Marti is a lot like working for Joss.  Both are brilliant and a delight to be around.  They also both look really hot in a skirt and belly shirt.<br><br>little miss muffet:  Yes, we're all pantsless.  Care to join?  Come on, everybody's doing it.  What are you, chicken?  (Sorry.  Having a high-school flashback there.)<br><br>SlayerQueen:  No rain here.  Santa Monica, California, I love you.  Kiss kiss.<br><br>gazoo:  That's an old wives tale -- oughhh!  My stomach!  Blub blub blub...<br><br>

<dd>Thoin: I'm even more excited about this season than when we started.  It's going to really be one to remember.  I'm honored to be a part of it.  What soul?  Things are looking good for a little Xander action.  I could use some new shirts myself.  I keep bursting out of mine.  Argggh!  Steve smash!<br><br>Newt:  A mighty man lunch consists of PBJ, protein drinks, and tenpenny nails.  Argggh!  Steve smash!<br><br>Morella:  It's a day of rest for me.  Now lay your head down and I'll lull you into a deep, deep sleep.  Argggh!  Steve smash!  THUNK!  Zzzzzzzzzz...<br><br>

<dd>Yo ho ho, Beta Bronzers.  Chowing down on a little mighty man lunch and thought I'd poke my head in for an hour of Sunday pokes and giggles.  How're you fine folks doing today?<br><br>
