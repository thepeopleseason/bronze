<DD>Okay, last post . . . <BR>
<BR>
Jymm--Nice to meet you.  I'd recommend Child of the Hunt as a starter.<BR>
<BR>
FYI to all who asked--Nancy's solo novel, The Evil That Men Do, has been postponed, along the lines of Earshot and G2.  I'm confident we'll see it soon, but not when it was originally schedule, I'm sorry to say.  As for the Yearbook, that's a September release.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Sultress, and Carl, thanks again.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, just a note:  anyone attending DragonCon in Atlanta over July 4th weekend, I'll be there.  Come look me up, probably at the Dark Horse booth, or at a panel or something.<BR>
<BR>
With that . . . good night all.  Be well.

<DD>Second to last post . ..<BR>
<BR>
AjO:  Um, I didn't write Visitors, but I'll pass the kudos on to those who did.  As for the Yearbook, it's EXACTLY that--the Sunnydale High Yearbook, class of 1999.<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie--Love Grease.  Go Thunderbirds.<BR>
<BR>
MJ--Thanks.

<DD>Angle Man:  Thanks.  And it looks like I'll be doing more of that.  As for the B/A issue, I'm afraid it comes down to this--it sells.<BR>
<BR>
Mabb:  Thanks!  *g*<BR>
<BR>
Monique:  Ask me again at Visions, and I'll think about it.<BR>
<BR>
Safarigirl--absolutely.<BR>
<BR>
Gazoo--I don't think Seth has anything to worry about.  I keep to the shadows, pretty much.<BR>
<BR>
Gwen--Thanks.  *blush*<BR>
<BR>
Going soon.  Gotta get some sleep.

<DD>Carl--you're scaring me.  People are saying bad things?  : )  Thanks, though.<BR>
<BR>
Ryana--I guess we need to get some new Buffy books out, huh?  Actually, though, there is a LOT of stuff packed into the trilogy.  Upcoming books include the first hardcover, Immortal, in October, and my solo Buffy book, Sins of the Father, in November.  Though I should also mention my new original novel, Strangewood, in September (shamless plug).  : )<BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer:  hey back!<BR>
<BR>
Widdleone:Thanks!  As for continuity, since the books are done far in advance, we have to be careful.  Since we never know how long characters like Faith will be around, it's safest just to leave them out.  (Too bad, 'cause I'd love to write about Faith.)</SMALL>

<DD>Kenickie:  Hope you like it when you get round to it.  Great name, btw.<BR>
<BR>
Thy Slayer:  Hey!<BR>
<BR>
Gazoo:  Things are crazy busy, as usual.  This is going to be a very BUFFY fall for me, though most of that work is already done.  I'm chomping at the bit for my new novel, STRANGEWOOD, to come out, and I just sold another that I have to get to work on.  Then there's that Body of Evidence series, which seems to be doing well, and the comics, and (maybe most importantly), the bite of the Hollywood bug.  *shrug*  At some point, time off will become a medical necessity.

<DD>Safarigirl--Thanks.  I love Oz, but he's probably the hardest one to write WELL.  As for the cookbook, my wife makes these thigns that are just . . . okay, you take a brownie mix, and fill tiny cupcake baking trays halfway, then stick a Hershey's kiss in there, and fill it the rest of the way, then sprinkle powdered sugar on top after they're baked.  OH.  MY.  GOD.<BR>
<BR>
Monique--Nah,frickin' wicked sounds like Dr. Evil.  You'd have to use "f**king" either before or after "wicked" to really get the right sound. ; )</SMALL>

<DD>Monique--hey.  Visions should be cool, but here's a primer for you.  In Boston, wicked=very, as in, "we had a wicked good time" or wicked=total/complete, as in "he's a wicked jerk."  'Course, in South Boston, you couldn't actually say jerk, but would say jehk instead.  Ah, you'll be talkin' like a Southie chick faster than you can say "Good Will Huntin'"  : )

<DD><b>Cleio:</b>  No, we're not.  We submitted an mp3 to the online Lilith Fair contest hosted by XOOM.com  The top ten vote-receivers ( by Aug. 1st) will be judged by a professional panel (whatever) and then the winner will be chosen.  The winner gets flown to Chicago to play a full set on the Village Stage.  The URL to vote is:<BR>

<b>Willow the Witch:</b>  Thanks!  We're working on the latest CD right now.<BR>
<b>Corvus:</b>  We won't know til the contest is over, on August 1st.  (They'll make their final decisiion by Aug 15th)<BR>
<b>drdan & Reagan:</b>  Good, thanks!  Gotta run, though.<BR>
<b>Heavenly:</b>  Well, we're a band that was on BtVS, the first season.  We've also made friends with a bunch of people affiliated with the show (in one way or another), so we've become kind of closely associated with Buffy, even though we were only on the show once.  The st<i></i>yle is hard to describe, but if you took a band like Portishead and gave them guitars and told them to rock, maybe they'd be close to what we sound like.  Go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">http://www.velvetchain.com</a> to find out more about us, and hear clips, see pics, etc.  =)<BR>

<DD>Gotta start wrapping things up here....<BR>
<BR>
FYI, the list at FSM's site (if it's still there) is outdated.  I've spoken to the woman in charge of the soundtrack at TVT records, and she's concerned about all the incorrct info on the net, 'cause she keeps getting angry letters in response to what people are perceiving to be the official track listing.  So, I guess I'm just saying take whatever you see on the net with a grain of salt.  We'll all know who's on it when the thing comes out, I guess!  =)<BR>
<b>Black Aria:</b>  Thank you!  No, not as of now.  We don't have any tour support, unfortunately.<BR>

<b>Jasmen:</b>  No worries.  You're just going to miss a ROCKIN show, with our brand-new DJ/percissionist/guitar-player (yes, we will have 2 guitars in a couple of songs), and I believe everybody just went to see FSM last week, and it's <i>our</i> only gig til August, but I understand.  (Hehehehehehe j/k)  Actually, I heard their show is free, and ours is $10, so I figure who can compete with that???<BR>
