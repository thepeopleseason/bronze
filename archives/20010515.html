<DD>  The Dance of Joy and Honor both came from Joss.  He did it in the room when we were breaking the story, and it was too brilliant to entrust into any other hands, so I asked if he'd do it in my episode -- and sure enough, he did.  It took a moment for the cast to even recognize him, as he was in full demon makeup.  But then they noticed that I was letting an extra sit in my chair and saying nothing... the only extra on the set who could fire me! And now I gotta go "poof".  Thanks all, and see yas.

<DD>  Vamps *can* be photographed, and for a very good reason.  Joss says they can.  And if you argue with it, he does the Dance Of Pain And Death.

<DD>Tim, if I ever run out of sweet fancy words, I know who to call.  And yes, that'd be you, my friend.<BR>
<BR>
And I leave you to the wonderful Bronzers.  Again, great, amazing ep.  <BR>

<DD>I bow down to the greatness that is Tim Minear.  Great, great ep. Bows also to Doug Petrie.  The two of you inspire me beyond words.

<DD>  No pressure for me writing the season finale at all... since Greenwalt wrote it.

per hour?!<BR>
<BR>
Bit of a fly-by here....Just got <BR>
done writing/mixing the FINAL <BR>
episode of Angel.<BR>
<BR>
Want to alert the bronze that <BR>
mp3's are coming VERY soon <BR>
to rkcc.clb.net (Rob Kral <BR>
Cameo Committee) and City <BR>
of Angel.com!!<BR>
<BR>
Fox wouldn't allow anything <BR>
