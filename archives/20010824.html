<dd>Sorry I had to dash off.  And hey, is my color code working yet?  <br><br>Unfortunately, I can't stay.  We're in the middle of breaking episode 8.  I'll try to stop back later this afternoon if I get the chance.<br><br>Thanks to everybody for the ET search.  You're all the best of the bestest.<br><br>Tiggy:  I still owe you an e.  But if it's any consolation, I think about you all the time. ;)<br><br>That's it for now.  Hopefully I'll be able to pop back a little later.<br><br>

<dd>Hey, I've lost my color!  But yes, it's really me.  I've got the yellow hula boxers to prove it.<br><br>

<dd>A fine pantsless Friday to you Beta Bronzers.  You got me until I get yanked back into a story meeting.  Type fast, baby!  Type fast!<br><br>But first, a special request from yours truly.  I'm searching for a gift for a wonderful coworker (shhh -- it's a surprise) and could use some help.  Years and years ago they made an ET finger that you could slip over your own, and it even lights up.  I've searched the web high and low, but can't find one.  Any help in pointing me in the right direction would be much appreciated.  If I'm not around, please email Tiggy and she'll pass on the info to me (cause, you know, she is a goddess).  Thanks!<br><br>
