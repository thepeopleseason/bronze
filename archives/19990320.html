<DD>last post<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - my main reason for not choosing Amends was it had the one big cue at the end and... not much else.  But again I agonized over this and must have changed my mind a dozen times.<BR>
<BR>
carl - what list exactly?<BR>
<BR>
mél - I grew up in Quebec, and it was in theaters when I was a kid - I remember being dragged kicking and screaming (A FRENCH film Dad?  Noooo!) but I ended up loving it.<BR>
<BR>
Ron - actually scroll down... it got moved to (ugh) 7:30 am on Monday<BR>
<BR>
OK, I'm off to eat Mongolian BBQ<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bye<BR>
<BR>
if I don't shout out to VT she'll kill me

<DD>second-to-last post, I've been on for over an hour now...<BR>
<BR>
Sarah the Brown - whoops, not a huge Philip Glass fan either.  Boy you Bronzers are striking out tonite.  In case anyone's interested my favorite non-film composer is currently John Adams.  (You can hear some of his influence in the opera theme for Angel... if it actually gets used)  My favorite film composers are in no particular order John Williams, Joerry Goldsmith, Danny Elfman, Thomas Newman, Eliot Goldenthal, and David Hirschfelder (who SO deserves an oscar tomorrow).<BR>
<BR>
wolfguard - ?<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - that's the plan, anyway.  Last year I agonized as well, ended up picking BBB, but B1 (or B2) were so clearly better choices by the time they rolled around.  I actually consider other things besides the actual score, like... can you *hear* the music, is it mixed well, is it a good episode besides the music, will the people judging the ep be able to follow the storyline even if they've never seen Buffy before...

Beldin - yeah, I saw it.  I'm, like, famous or sumthin.<BR>
<BR>
Wax - it's got beer in it... but don't drink it!  (depending on how old you are you may have no idea what I'm talking about)<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - I've not seen Cruel.  Should I?  <BR>
<BR>
Willow- - Bobbi is a session singer here in L.A.  I'm sure she's appeared on many CD's but I don't think she's a recording artist - more of a "hired gun" type.<BR>
<BR>
mél - Subway was such a cool movie.  Didn't realize he scored that - must go rent it again soon.<BR>
<BR>
Floater - thanks and someone else answered your Q.

Strawberries - Thanks.  I'll make sure to have faster tempos from now on so you can write even faster<BR>
<BR>
Wax - LOL (Where are Xander's tools and didn't pools of liquid emerge?)  (OK so it has nothing to do with anything but I thought I'd try)<BR>
<BR>
Hey Ron.  How goes it?<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - 400 pages?  Wow.  And don't be jealous of LW, I'll shout out to you in my next score.  Just listen for the melody that goes up then down... that'll be your shoutout.  Caouldn't you be called ABE or something easy to translate to musical notation?<BR>
<BR>
The always enigmatic Oki'LLbyte - thanks, although I've never met the singer coming over tomorrow, she may indeed be fat... that'll be big trouble!<BR>
<BR>
ceridwen - you want a musical spoiler?  OK...<BR>

horizon - funny you should ask.  The Emmy deadline was yesterday.  I agonized over my decision... but I ended up going with Doppelgangland, more or less after flipping a six-sided coin.  (Sorry Circe, I know you're partial to Amends).  There's an extension for any eps that air after the deadline.  Unless I do something really wrong I fully expect to replace DGL with the season finale when I finish it.  So we'll see...

Horselover - I'd love nothing more than to tell you where I am.  I'm not at the set (I hardly ever go to the set, I've only been twice in two years of working on the show).  I'm not at home either.  I'm at my studio in Burbank.  I just finished getting the opera theme to where I like it and have nothing much to do until tomorrow afternoon.  My wife is in Taiwan promoting her new album.  So here I am.<BR>
<BR>
Ohh, that reminds me... They're gonna use one of Jane's songs, called "Pack Up & Go" (about a break-up) as the main song in all the "Pleasantville" TV & radio ads in Taiwan.  AND they're gonna replace Randy Newman's end credits sequence with the song.  Great news for the album but... hunh?<BR>
<BR>
Hey Cirrus.  My beard is currently inspiring me to scratch it.  Little white flakes falling everywhere.  OK that was maybe more than y'all needed to hear.<BR>
<BR>
AL24-7 thanks.  Fun!<BR>
<BR>
mél - whoops, I'm not the hugest Eric Serra fan.  I loved the Big Blue.  But Goldeneye... well, there's a magazine called "Film Score Monthly" that does reviews of scores, and they have a five star system, and at one point like a year ago it went something like this:  5 stars = must have, 4 stars = excellent, 3 stars = good, 2 stars = OK, 1 star = Goldeneye.  So you see that score in particular has a rather infamous rep as a real stinker.  And I'm inclined to agree.  (Sorry)  (But Debussy and Ravel totally ROCK!)<BR>
<BR>
I'm supposed to have a little article on me in FSM at some point soon, written by our very own CynthiaLil...

St Germain - hang in there, I'm sending some good vibes your way<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - I have no clue what the finale is called or even what it's about.  (Hmmm could it be the mayor?)<BR>
<BR>
OK, here's a little spoiler for "Earshot" I don't think the powers that be would mind too much if I revealed... SPOILER <s>jonathan fans will be pleased</s> SPOILER<BR>
<BR>
Wow, that was *much* more than I usually give away.<BR>
<BR>
kim! - I'm, not too clear on that.  I'd surmise that if the evening was boring, Elfman's excitingness must be called into question.<BR>
<BR>
AL24-7 - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - hi

Green Falcon - Actually that's more or less true - it won't sound like it came from an opera.  It would certainly be very different from most theme music on TV but it won't be fully operacentric.<BR>
<BR>
Also keep in mind these are just demos I'm working on.  The opera theme is one of three I'm proposing.  So who knows what the theme will end up being.<BR>
<BR>
Oki - As a Buffy Prof?  Like professor?  And don't worry.  I won't leave Buffy.  It is after all the single greatest show ever invented for a composer to score.<BR>
<BR>
Horselover - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - awesome, will you be able to put up all of the s2 clips?  Hey, wince I don't own Chris Golden's book, would someone elaborate on the nature of the Little Willow reference I keep hearing about in chapter 9?

AL24-7 - hi<BR>
<BR>
ripley - thanks.  can't not ask... how?<BR>
<BR>
kim! - I, uhh, forgot to go.  Felt really dumb until I talked to someone who was there, and he told me that it was kinda boring.  Said the best part was an hour-long documentary on bernard Hermann they showed before Danny's talk...<BR>
<BR>
Claterring - Good question.  That would be the sound effects department.  I don't know specifically what they use for the vampire growl but I do know that oftentimes sfx editors will take a natural sound, like a lion growl, and pitch it up or down and combine it with maybe a different growl and generally mess with it until it sounds cool.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Besides the Angel Theme I'm gearing up to start Earshot.  We spot Monday at 7:30 am (ouchie) because Joss needs to be directing ep 21 at 9 am.  Otherwise not a lot going on... as usual I'm in various stages of consideration for a small handful of other projects.

Green Falcon - I'm definitely scoring the new series, though at some point in the season I will share those duties with another composer.  The theme is up for grabs but I'm taking the first crack at it.<BR>
<BR>
Natalie - oh yes, opera.  sort of.<BR>
<BR>

Just being bored...<BR>
<BR>
Hey, maybe this is interesting, I'm recording an opera singer tomorrow (soprano) for one of my Angel theme ideas.
