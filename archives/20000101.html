<DD> Well, looks like it's time to crawl off to the crypt. I can't give you any info on future episodes, but I will tell you that I am currently working on a make-up that is 6 hours long. It exhausts me to think about Monday! Bye for now. Happy y2k-ing!

<DD> Batra: Well, it's complicated. Joss describes what he wants to John Vulich of Optic Nerve. They make drawings. Once the drawings are approved, Optic Nerve makes the appliances. They and I talk at this point and I am prepared for what is comming. Then when the day comes, I get the appliances and begin the col<i></i>oring research. For this show I painted 4 different heads until Joss liked the effect. Then we do it for real. So the answer to your question is that it is done by committee - but it is all Joss's idea. i have to go now. Any more questions before I run away?

<DD> Sorry darkhorse, I thought you were with the comic series. I have met and enjoyed the company of all those guys and girls.

<DD> Jimbo: I always read the issues. What drawing was yours? I'll have to go back and look. <BR>
NuPhalanx:The laughing men worked a lot. They were difficult make-ups and cost agreat deal in time and money. I was under a handicap as the filming of "The Grinch" has taken ove 65 of LA's best make-up artists out of my pool or regular help. That meant a lot more had to be on my regular staff's shoulders than usual. In answer to your other question; We do have a show sponsered Christmas party when we wrap for the holidays, though the workload was so great this year the party had to be scaled way back. As to seeing everyone over the holiday - mostly we lie low and rest up. I did have a party for our stunt players. That was great fun.

<DD> Angus: Thanks and hello.<BR>
Meteor: Yes, if I'm invited I would love to be there. I enjoyed the last ones very much - meeting all of you. (It can be overwhelming, though). And Jasmen: I'd love to be at every function but I am usually working on the show! Plus they don't often invite me to those - or even tell me about them!<BR>
Darkhorse: Is that you? Howdy.<BR>
Claris: hello.
