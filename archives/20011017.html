<dd>Allyson, Didn't mean to scare you off <br>or anything, it's just that I Live AND <br>work in Pasadena: that's where all <br>this Angel music is recorded! If you <br>live north of Lake you might even <br>here it being pelted out of the studio!<br><br>jennifer: aren't those invisible <br>spoilers COOL?!<br><br>Dru in LA (in England): it's 12:42 here <br>in Pasadena, California, so I'm <br>working, but I should be having <br>lunch, or at least I shouldn't be on the <br>Bronze Beta!<br><br>Kam: yeah its probably fine for me to <br>post there and everything, its moe <br>like....why bother?!<br><br>

<dd>Allyson, yes it's really me. Not sure <br>how to prove it. Seems my colors are <br>appearing on my posts now so <br>maybe that's a sign. <br><br>So this is the refugee camp?!! I think <br>its cool. Looks just like the old <br>Bronze and even has some <br>improvements!<br><br>Princess of Darkness: What Party <br>you ask? Well, I checking into a <br>forum like this in the middle of a <br>hectic work day is like walking into a <br>party. We can pretend can't we?<br><br>Kilverstone: glad to be here. We <br>should get memos about this at work <br>(where to find the Bronze etc) but we <br>on our own!<br><br>Narrator: I didn't look too much at the <br>offical site. its Buffy only, and hey, this <br>seems to be the only site VIPS get <br>color! Actually this might be the only <br>site with VIPS. Plus its,Angel, its <br>Buffy, its caramel, it's chocolate. <br>(Shouldn't start that again)<br><br>

<dd>Ah yes, this is the (real) new Bronze. <br>Just checked out the official Buffy <br>Bronze. Seeing this site (Beta <br>Bronze) is a bit like coming home.<br><br>Nothin' UPN can do about it, but at <br>least here us Angel VIPS can party <br>on too!<br><br>

<dd>Kevin UK - Not widescreen.  More like short screen.  You know, with the bands.<br><br>Anyway, must return to the grind now. <br><br>(Wait.  It's not a grind.  It's fun to be working so hard.  Really.)<br><br>Take care, all.  Sorry if I missed a post from anyone.  But you're all in my pants... <br><br>THOUGHTS!  You're all in my THOUGHTS.  Geez.  Sorry.<br><br>

<dd>Brassbow - After four and a half years of working for him, I've pretty much come to the conclusion that there's nothing Joss can't do.  He plays whatever he wants, whenever he wants.<br><br>Evalie - No apostrophes.  They confound me.<br><br>

<dd>To those inquiring about the documentary, it all probably depends on if FOX thinks there's a market for it.  Eveyone's interest seems to indicate there is.<br><br>Rikki - Be not afraid.  I've had my teeth removed and my paws declawed.<br><br>Brassbow - I feel your pain.  I suspect many in tv like the letterbox format since it gives their shows a cinematic scope.  (Everybody wants to make movies.)<br><br>

<dd>Evalie - Next week's is an Espenson/Fury ep.  Jane wrote the funny stuff, I contributed the commas and pregnant pauses.<br><br>spike's girl - The Musical "Once More With Feeling" airs Nov. 6.  And it will be nothing short of brilliant.  A great score written by Joss.<br><br>

<dd>Princess - Talk to Allyson.  She runs my site and filters requests and stuff.<br><br>Thanks, Kestra.<br><br>greeneyes - There's a lot of legal issues to work out with FOX before the general public can see it.  Maybe it'll be on the DVD.  We'll see.<br><br>

And thanks for the board.<br><br>Allyson - Oh, Doug's around.  Maybe he'll stop in later.<br><br>Thanks, Artemis.  And for the record books, the title was "hell" with a lower-case "h."<br><br>

<dd>Jenkins -- Not bad.  Just dull.  And derivitive.  Don't know how they plan to sustain a Superman show when he doesn't fly or put on the costume.<br><br>Bullseye - As far as we're concerned, this is the only place to post.  I can't even get on the "official" site.<br><br>Allyson - Someday...<br><br>Safarigirl - Already conveyed.<br><br>

<dd>Hello.  i may have trouble convincing you i'm joss, but I really am.  I mean, even more than usual.  I'm SO Joss that... it doesn't matter.  Only the information I have is important.  And I don't actually have any.  EXCEPT THIS:  I have spoken to the brass a UPN very specifically about getting a real posting board on the site.  They're new at this, but it's gonna happen.  And we will chat and there will be colors and all will be well.  Just be patient.  In the meanwhile, here is my usual list of obviously fake spoilers:<br><br>All gay<br><br>Buffy dies<br><br>Runaway bunny --from the GRAVE!<br><br>Ah, my heart just ain't in it.  Anyhoo, to be concludy, thanks to those that have been keeping the torch burning -- I only heard about this place tonight.  I'm all beat up from shooting the damn musical.  I'm at the it's-a-disaster-they're-gonna-take-away-my-DGA-card-and-put-me-in-a-cage stage.  Hopefully that will be replaced by a more optimistic frame of mind any day now.<br><br>So there it is.  You can now all start doubting my identity.<br><br><br><br>love<br><br><br><br>j<br><br>
