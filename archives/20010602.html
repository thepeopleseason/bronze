<DD>Xanderella, knew that, just drawing your attention to my response.  Sorry.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Now really leaving, and not in a Ty way.

<DD>Anti--I live in terror of that day.  Hi and bye.  *smooch*  I'm gone.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella--loved the finale.  Wish that layabout Whedon would just write and direct it every week.  ("That's a joke, son.  Get it, a joke." --Foghorn Leghorn)

<DD>Risa--greatest literary aspirations . . . too serious for the weekend.  :)  The short answer is this--to change your world, even just for a little while.  What could be greater than that?<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow, Xanderella, etc--Honestly, who the hell would pretend to be me?  I mean, Sarah, okay, David, sure, James, the whole crew, Joss of course.  But me?  Silly, silly Hel Sparrow.  *grin*

<DD>2nd to last post, really should be working. (Saturday, sigh.)<BR>
<BR>
Dirty Socks, thanks!  Love that AngelRachel.  She gives the best presents.  LOL<BR>
<BR>
Soul--Umm . ..  London?<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow--uhhh . . . Virginia?  I don't live in Virginia.  I live in MA.

<DD>Paks--hey there.  :)  Thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Gregoranaz--Thanks amigo.  Glad you enjoyed it.  I'd like to do more eventually, but right now you'd have to satisfy yourself with the upcoming collection of the three comics I did (one of which I wrote with James Marsters).  Also, there might be something to tie into the Buffy video game that Tom Sniegoski and I are writing the script for.<BR>
<BR>
Phil PhuD--Geez, I'd hope they'd get more horrific, not more superheroic.  Ah, well . . .<BR>
<BR>
Kiba--I've read all of Promethea.  Like it, don't love it.  I think it's very uneven, actually.  Some of it I adore, but there are entire issues that I could do without.  Just as you say about individual tastes.<BR>
<BR>
Risa--I have a feeling if Joss ever wants to write a novel, he'll have no problem doing it himself.  : )

<DD>Beldin, hey!<BR>
<BR>
Risa--your wish is my command.  Look for OZ: INTO THE WILD in stores sometime next year.  Meanwhile, read the comic book miniseries starting in July.<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow--thanks.  Glad you're enjoying it.<BR>
<BR>
Morella--I mean, I'VE seen the finale.  Twice.  But if I hadn't and I came in here I'd be pretty ticked.  Heh.  As for signings, got one on the 14th at Waterstone's in Manchester UK and one on the 15th at Forbidden Planet in London.  : )

<DD>Ah, jeez, Kiba, thanks, but I've got a pretty thick skin.  Believe me, there are lots of B/A related comics I'm not happy with. But while we're on the subject, here's a little list from me of comics more people should be reading:<BR>
<BR>
Herobear and the Kid<BR>
Strangers in Paradise<BR>
Hellboy<BR>
Bone<BR>
Top Ten<BR>
Birds of Prey<BR>
JSA<BR>
Desperadoes<BR>
Nocturnals<BR>
Planetary<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, this is just the stuff that's still regularly published.  Hopefully everyone will also check out classics like From Hell, Watchmen, V For Vendetta, Sandman.

<DD>Risa--thanks.  :)  I think Joss has plenty of talented folks at his disposal, so I doubt I'll ever get that call.  But hey, ya never know.<BR>
<BR>
Red Thunder, hey!  :)<BR>
<BR>
Guenevere--sure.  Why not e-mail me at my site, www.christophergolden.com.  Tell me about the group.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Keeeeeebs!!!  Nope, not leaving 'til the 12th.<BR>
<BR>
Phil PhuD--Yep, you did.  *snicker*  It isn't easy working with licensed stuff, but I think we stand up pretty well compared to other licensed books that will remain nameless.  Heh heh.<BR>
<BR>
KAT-hi!<BR>
<BR>
Morella--Hope I get to see you anyway, at one of the signings.<BR>
<BR>
And, btw, to all . . . where are the SPOILER warning??  I mean, boy you guys are just spoiling seriously for anyone who hasn't seen the finale yet.

<DD>Hey Morella!  Thanks.  :)  I hope to see you there.  Are you not going to be able to make Nocturnal though?<BR>
<BR>
Phil PhuD--umm, so when you say "most" . . . I might want to argue that.  Heh heh.

<DD>Hey all.  Probably not the best time for me to drop in for a visit with "Sarah" here, but I've been AWOL a while and thought I'd say hi to the new "stealth Bronze."  : )  So hello!  Don't see a lot of familiar "faces" except Beldin and ValMichael, but SOs to all my Bronze friends, esp. my bodyguard Little Willow and the Boston contingent.<BR>
