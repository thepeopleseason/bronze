<DD>Got time to answer just a couple of more questions before I split back to the set, then off for the weekend.<BR>
<BR>
Kronos:  Thanks.  Strangely enough, it's my real name.  I'll tell you guys my whole story on Boo's soon-to-be-infamous DeKnight's Riders site, but yes, I got slapped with tons of rejection before I landed this sweet gig.  One studio reader actually called my writing "wooden, wordy, turgid, and substandard".  I remind him of this fact every time he fills my tank with super unleaded.<BR>
<BR>
Speare: Thanks! I've only been on one other show: MTV's Undressed.  Then I won the lottery and wound up here.<BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Yes, it's true.  You caught me.  I wrote "And They Call It Puppet Love" my first season on MTV's Undressed. <BR>
<BR>
EverDawn: I like 'em extra bumpy!  And hoo yeah, Boo totally rocks!<BR>
<BR>
singsinthecar: Hey, great pic!  It's all coming back to me now...<BR>
<BR>
Sarah's Carl: Thanks for the ep. date.  And oh yes -- SMG is extra cool.  And one of the best actresses on TV.<BR>
<BR>
The Reborn:  Dude!  Sweeeeet!<BR>
<BR>
AngelRachel: We usually have 5 - 7 days for a first draft, then a couple of more to polish it up.  When we're not working on our own script, we're working as a team to break the next story.  And actually, I am exclusive to Buffy right now.  They stole my wittle heart!<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane: I am a pale shade of blue.  If I wrote in that color, I might completely disappear.  Like I'm about to do now...<BR>
<BR>
That's it for today.  Thanks for watching our little show.  You guys are the best!<BR>
<BR>
- Steve

<DD>AngelRachel: Yeah, you caught me.  I knew the Willow/Tara kiss was coming up soon.  But didn't my little misdirection make the moment that more surprisingly sweet?  And yes, I'll try to stop by every Friday, time permitting.<BR>
<BR>
genrefan: My episode (#20) will air soemtime in May, I think.  I'm not sure of the exact date.<BR>
<BR>
X83:  I'll never talk!  NEVER!<BR>
<BR>
DeAN:) Mighty Man James Cotner is directing my episode. <BR>
<BR>
Angel of Death:  Yeah, I'm a character all right.  Just ask my friends.<BR>
<BR>
PIPPISTRELL: I saw an advance copy of Joss' comic book Fray floating around the office.  It's amazing.  Everybody run out and buy a copy as soon as it hits the stands in May.  You'll love it!

<DD>Back from the set watching a little ep. 20 action.  Extra cool.  I'll answer some of the questions I just read in a sec.  I'll be here till 5PM (Pacific Time), so post away, my sweet bumpy minions!

<DD>Boo:  Just took a look at the DeKnight's Riders website.  I'm totally blushing.  Soon as I get the chance I'll e-mail some of those never before seen pics I promised.  What format and res do you want them in?<BR>
<BR>
As for the rest of you mighty Bronzers, go support Boo and sign up for DeKnight's Riders!  Remember -- you reach 300 members and I send in my embarrassing topless muscle man pic (just don't look at it when you're eating lunch).<BR>
<BR>
As for more Buffy from me, yes, you'll get one more this season.  I wrote episode #20 which they're shooting right now as we speak.  I'll be popping down to the set in a second to see how great the cast is making me look. Gotta tell you -- they're just as wonderful people as they are actors.  It's the best set I've ever been on.

<DD>Yes, you'll all be pleased to know that I am firmly planted in my pants today. I'm even wearing my snowman boxers.  Mmm!  Comfy!<BR>
<BR>
As for the howdy, no snubbing from me.   I love each of you with equal disdain.  ;-)

<DD>Hey, it's Friday.  That means it must be time for me to stop in and say howdy to all you wonderful Bronzers.  So here it is.  You ready? <BR>
<BR>
Howdy!<BR>
<BR>
Whooh.  I feel much better.
