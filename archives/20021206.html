<dd>Apparantly, i am on.  This crazy web:  I read here that I posted elsewhere just minutes ago.  This is truly the information age, except without all the having-more-knowledge thing.  Yup, I'm everywhere (I'm here, i'm gone, i'm hither and yon, I'm johnny-not-on-the-spot), haunting the sites, turning over every rock to get the word out about Firefly tomorrow night.  Since we're back and all.  I even re-learned my password so you wouldn't have to spend eighty six hours deciding whether i'm really me or not!  Now I realize this is not strictly a firefly type board, but y'all are family, so i'm stopping in anyway.<br><br>On th' buffy tip, we're having insane fun.  We just locked ep 10, and it's not un-moving.  And, oh, the horrors -- I mean playful banter -- we have in store.  I will reveal, as is my custom, NOTHING (evil laugh), but we are winding up for a fastball that I swear is gonna crack the bat.  That's all I'm sdaying.  (And I said fastBALL.  We are not winding up for a fastLANE in any way.  I can't stress this enough.  I mean, what, did the LAPD run out of shirts?)  (When did i get so catty?)   (Oh yeah, season three.)<br><br>So, anyhoo.  Firefly tomorrow at eight.  Buffy 10 coming soon.  One way or another, I'm gonna #@&$ your $%*# up.  Or die trying.<br><br>And, in case anything gets back here that may be misunderstood, a penguin shot my father.<br><br>j<br><br>
