<DD>  Okay, I think my computer's starting to doze.  (And I think it's been drinking.)  So, I will say good night.  <BR>
<BR>
Very funny ep. on Tuesday, written by Tracey Forbes.  Followed by the incomparable Jane Espenson's first ANGEL.  <BR>
<BR>
Enjoy.  G'nite.

<DD>As 99% of the scripts are filtered through Joss' genius, WHAT ACTOR WOULD WANT TO CHANGE A WORD?  (Sorry, didn't mean to yell.)<BR>
<BR>
Actually, on very rare occassions, someone might ask to say a line a little differently, if they're having trouble with what's written.  But they always ask permission from Joss.  He'll almost always allow it, unless he thinks it upsets a joke or the tone of the scene.

<DD>Kya -- Actually eveyone on staff's involved with all the eps. in one fashion or another.  We generally break (beat-out) stories as a group, even when ideas belong to others or most often, to Joss.  Joss is obviously the final say on everything, but he likes to entertain thoughts, lines, ideas from his staff.<BR>
<BR>
Yep, I state the obvious.

<DD>No, Lauren.  Never been.  Always wanted.<BR>
<BR>
Lurking- No arguing.  You have to be open to the idea that maybe you're wrong.  (That's easy to do on this show, since I have the good fortune of working with some pretty brilliant minds.)</SMALL>

<DD> The most time efficient way to work with someone is to split the script in half (i.e. One does Acts 1&2, the other Acts 3&4)  but it could also be dealt out depending on people's preferences for affinity for certain scenes.  Depends on who you're sharing a script with.  (yeah, I know... I dangled a participle.  Wanna make something of it?)

<DD>Greetings to friends Down Under --<BR>
<BR>
Advice?Write a lot.  Get yourself an agent (preferably in L.A. since that's where most TV is produced) and get yourself read at show's you're interested in.  That's how it works here (though it takes luck to wind up on a great show like BUFFY).  Believe me, I'm knocking wood as we speak.  (And, no, that's not a dirty euphemism.)</SMALL>

<DD> Lili'Tree - How long it takes me to write an ep. and how long I and my fellow staffers are  usually given are two very different things.<BR>
<BR>
After a story's broken, I prefer two weeks (including the writing of a beat sheet/outline), but usually we're given 7-10 days.<BR>
<BR>
In point of fact, Marti and I are cowriting the next ep. because we'll only have about 3-5 days to write it.

<DD>XG - Ep. 11 is as yet untitled (as it is yet unbroken) and Ep. 10 title is a secret, so hush.

<DD>Ahh, sweet aqua.<BR>
<BR>
AjO - Haven't figured out any interesting spins on Phantom.  If you come up with one, let me know.  (I'll steal your idea, win acclaim for the ep. along with a small fortune.  Then you can haunt the Buffy soundstage, causing accidents among the crew along your way to revealing how I cheated you out of your  credit.)<BR>
<BR>
Hey, wait a minute...

And Lovely Poet -- I'm a little furry, I suppose.  Maybe they should highlight that, too.

<DD>SInce a couple of you asked... <BR>
About to co-write an episode with the Marti "the Heart of Buffy" Noxon.  A great honor.  Ep. 11, after Joss' groundbreaking ep. 10.  Also co-wrote ANGEL ep. 10 "Parting Gifts" - with Angel writer (and VR5 co-creator) Jeanine Renshaw.

<DD>Lil'Tree - Wow.  Thank you again.  Believe me, I'm always glad to share a piece of what you generously call "creative genius," though I'm not sure I have enough to parcel out.  In fact, that gauge is hovering awfully close to "E."  ; )

<DD> Well, for one thing, I'd sure like to find out how I can get "Fury" to light up in the postings.  (My fragile ego knows "David" lights up 'cause of Greenwalt, Boreanaz and the thirty other Davids who work on B&A.)
