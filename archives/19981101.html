<DD>Fizzgig - you are correct.  We film/tv composers live in a VERY small world - I would guess most of us have at least heard of most of the rest of us.<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel - You just haven't heard the B/A theme enough.  Go watch Surprise/Innocence a few more times.  And: hunh?

<DD>whim - yes, that was me who handled Buffy stabbing Angel.  I write all the background music for the show.  Basically, if you're hearing music, and it's not the theme, and it's not a song, I wrote it.  Oh yeah, and if it's any good.

<DD>AKA BECKER - I may be repeating myself here but I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be.  And I swear I'm not being paid by RD to pad the board with VIP postage.<BR>
<BR>
Angelus7 - Suckup noted and appreciated.  Especially the part where you figure out the music on the piano.<BR>
<BR>
Fizzgig - heard the name Carl johnson, but don't know him.  Going over to imdb to see what he's done... Oh yeah, animation stuff.  Now I know where I've heard his name - a good friend of mine is a studio guitarist here, and he plays on all the Animaniacs sessions.<BR>
<BR>
Lisa - g'night.<BR>

<DD>Avarice - If Party Man means sleeping & watching a lot of TV I'm your guy.<BR>
<BR>
Alex - If I'm not mistaken I already have a copy of one of Ron's compilations.  (Which I got a kick out of listening to, if you don't mind telling him for me...)  And if I'm not re-mistaken Ron & I have another acquaintance in common: the guy I hired to do the graphics on a CD I just did, Mark B., is a friend of his.  I think.<BR>
<BR>
Dianne - I'd take you in my luggage but I'm not going anywhere.  Least of all the Eiffel Tower.  It's actually just my wife that's away...  sniff...<BR>
<BR>
<i>Disobeying his express wishes</i> Hi to Laurence.

<DD>Bruce's Mom - Yes, Buffy and Angel's theme has a title.  It's called "Buffy and Angel's Theme".<BR>
<BR>
OK, actually it has no official title, but I generally refer to it as "The Buffy/Angel Love Theme" which is pretty much what I said above.  Most of all I refer to it as "being phased out".<BR>
<BR>
Bridget aka scotlore - Ennio = awesome.  Loved "Lolita" music almost as much as "Cinema Paradiso" music.  Actually my wife's (being a talented composer herself) fantasy is to meet him and maybe visit one of his recording sessions...  Can anybody here help her out?  Any PBers in Italy?

<BR>
Lisa - I must respectfully disagree re: the "hi" postings.  I generally don't respond to the "hi's" but seeing them gives me a happy.  I can always ignore them if I want, right?<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and hi, Lisa.<BR>

<BR>
FWIW, I like the VIP sitch as is.  I, for one, have a nice time when I come in here... otherwise I wouldn't come back.  Then again, being more of a behind-the-scenes type, I may not get quite the stalkeriffic response Sarah might...

Oh, and FYI, the word is "Slutty."  Not "Sluty."  That would be peonounced, "Slooty," and I don't think that's what the bezoar meant.

If anyone ever says anything that could be taken the "wrong" way, I have to jump on it.  It's a sickness.  That's what I've been doing to you lately.  It's a sign of affection, really it is!<BR>
<b>Chrysanthemum:</b>  Cool.  Ordering is of the good. =)<BR>
<b>Kyle:</b>  Yes, I send stickers to Canada all the time.  when Canadian register at our site, however, they need to put their postal code in the "how" section, as it won't fit in the zip-code field.  And cool about the VelvetChain person.<BR>
<b>Ozzie:</b>  Sure, go ahead.  Just link to us in return, OK?  And if you want to give a photo credit, they were taken by lovely Lena of the Bronze...<BR>

<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, I didn't do much of anything.  I came home, had dinner, worked a little bit on a new song, and read a book.  It was lovely, actually.  As for record execs, I know all about 'em.  That's why I live by the notto, "Full-speed ahead!  Damn the torpedos!" coupled with "Never say Die!"  I figure if I'm bull-headed enough, eventually I'll break through.

<b>Nouveaux:</b>  Hi!  How've ya been?  Haven't seen you in quite a while...<BR>
<b>ParisAngel:</b>  Well, sure you can pay cash, but of course, you know what they say about sending cash through the mail, so do so at your own risk.  (We have received a few orders with cash enclosed, so I don't think there should be too much of a problem.)  I hate to be "greedy," but if you don't want to enclose the $.50, you'll have to round the amount up to $12, OK?  We're barely covering our costs, as it is.  I hope you understand. =)</SMALL>

<b>Blackheart:</b>  Don't know.  We're concentrsting on securing a major label-deal right now.  If that doesn't happen, for whatever reason, I'm sure we'll put out another CD on our own.  Maybe late '99.<BR>
<b>bubbles:</b>  Sounds interesting.  I personally really liked "What Dreams May Come."  I saw it on the GIANT screen at Mann's Chinese theather a few weeks ago.  Very visually arresting.  And I love mythology, so the whole Orpheus and Eurydice overtone was cool.<BR>
<b>ZephyrHawk</b>Well, hello.  I am honored to be your first VIP encounter...as I mentioned before, I don't know when or even if we'll be on again.  But I'm optimistic. =)</SMALL>

<DD>RSO's to <b>WinterRain, CharlieX, ?, and Avarice!</b>  I didn't do much last night other than relax and work on music.  But I did go to a Halloween party on Friday night.<BR>
<b>Pixie:</b>  LOL..We've atarted giving out 2 large and two small stickers to everyone who registers at the site...that way, you can give them to friends, put one on yur car, etc.  And yes, if you'd like to send $11.50 straight to the address on the envelope, that would be fine.  The CD's cost $11.95 plus $1.50 s&h off the website, but if you avoid the missleman and send a check or money order straight to us, (Make it out to FREAK PRODUCTIONS) we'll let you have the CD for $10.  Saves you $2...pretty good, eh?<BR>
<b>bubbles:</b>  Yeah...wow!<BR>
<b>Jaclyn:</b>  Well, they haven't contacted us yet about another appearance, so I doubt it will be anytime soon. =(  However, it does look pretty good for the soundtrack-deal...but I don't want to jinx anything.  Make sure eveyone you know has voted for us on the feedback-form, OK?  (And no, it won't be out 'til Spring...)<BR>

<BR>
<b>rage:</b>  (from last night)  Ah...I alsways wanted to play drums.  I play piano, keyboards, recorder (yep, that silly medeival flute-instrument) and percussion.  I use the keys for composing, but I never play them live.  (Too awkward, with me running around the stage so much...and those hand-held guitar-looking keyboard things are SO lame!!!!)  I do play the other instruments live, however...of course I can only play recorder when I'm not singing, LOL.  We also like to use any random thing that makes cool sounds on stage.  Like walkie-talkies, for example.  I get a pretty mean rhythm part going by using the feedback created by holding the two w/t's together and jamming on the talk buttons.  Talk to you next time.
