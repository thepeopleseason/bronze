<DD>I really did leave, but a quick lurk after drew me back so I could make one quick shout out to Mazelle.  Thank you for your posts.  They mean a lot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Remember the part where I said I'd leave?  This is the part where it comes true.  Been fun to see you all again (in print).  Now work/sleep/work/sleep/watch Matrix/work/sleep/talk endlessly about Matrix/sleep cycle must continue.  Be well<BR>

<DD>Okay, i'm gone, I am vanished, i'm like the mist, if the mist was gonna stick around and post a teeny bit more.  The roomie thing: I said (or meant) that you become a parody of YOURSELF, that with my bad roomie I became a hideous Joss caricature and he one of him.  As for producer, Jeez we havre a lot.  there are writing producers -- once a writer reaches a certain level, they're a producer, that's just the title.  There are physical production guys, guys more like film producers, who make the things we write happen.  There are producers who just have the credit because they own a piece of the rights.  I think by year five the credits will run into the sceond act, but what can you do?

<DD>Okay, gettin' to be time to stop babbling.  Time close up shop and hit the sack.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, go!  Hit the sack!<BR>
<BR>
Is this not clear?  I want you to leave!  I'm not going anywhere, what are you, nuts?  I'm here all night!  Yeah!  posting MANIA, except without you as I wish you would leave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Really.<BR>
<BR>
OKAY. FINE.  I'll go.  (man, are you difficult...)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and the Opium Den?  I can't remember the exact location but it gives lie to the concept that LA isn't on a hellmouth.  International House of poseurs, like the woman said.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Actually, Ripley, it should read: "Marti wrote a script that I hardly had to touch, it was so tight."  Taking/giving credit is a strange thing in TV.  Sometimes you rewrite an ep completely, top to bottom, and no one ever knows.  sometimes five of us end up working on one script.  Martui has done uncredited work on tons of Buffy and angel scripts.  Either you do work no one gives you credit for, or the opposite -- everyone always compliments me on the crane-game scene in toy story, which i didn't write.  Fact is, i've built an extraordinary staff on Buffy -- wait til you see Jane Espenson's work next week.

<DD>Okay.  Couple of other issues.  Re: angel.  Sunlight.  Yeah, that's been a problem.   It's just hard for the DP to light the show and avoid it entirely.  And then tonight there was a shot that was col<i></i>ortimed so that what was supposed to be pre-dawn came out like post-dawn.  Bear with us, we know it's not all there yet.  As to the Prof in Buffy ep 1) I freely confess that he's bas<i></i>ed on an old prof of mine, Joe Reed, who kicked my friend David out of the class day one in front of 200 kids.  Joe is cool.

<DD>Ripley: oh, so you natually assume that I made buffy blameless but that Marti put in the end with the sandwich.  Fine.  Why don't you just MARRY HER?  No, I'm fine.  i'll just sit here.  Actully, the whole point of the ep was that with an insufferable roommate you become equally insufferable -- you become a parody of yourself.  And the end was meant to drive that home.  But let's talk about your NEW WIFE, Marti.  GOD, she can write.  She just nails these characters, and that healthy puppy obsession is pretty damn fetching.  Every now and then me and her and Greenwalt just sit back and say hey, it's nice to be a triumverate of evil.      <BR>
Bythe by, Angleman -- I heard about Brendon Frasier, they asked if I wanted to rewrite AGAIN and I just couldn't even though I think he's a god.  Best of luck to 'em (and isn't there a series of it now anyway?)</SMALL>

<DD>Interesting reactions to the various characters and their various hairs... I'm factoring this all in...  And somebody asked how me and Greenie can do both shows and stay sane -- well, something's gotta fall by the wayside there, and we naturally decided we could do without all that sanity.  No problem with that so far, except I keep pitching the Angel-debates-socio economics-with-a-sturgeon season arc and greenwalt thinks his lungs are plotting against him.  But expect the same quality television you've always gotten, except without the quality, and possibly a litle less television.

<DD>Hey guys.  Had no computer last week, couldn't log on to see what y'all thought.  Reaction here seems mixed but okay, and I can live with that.  Buffy, some dug some didn't but at least it's a TOTALLY accurate portrayal of roomies -- I almost hired a man to kill mine when he straightened his rug one time.  And he hated me even more.  Next week the CROSSOVER EVENT - don't the promos make it look like Buffy and Angel crossover?  Of course, this time around it's only Spike -- and Oz -- but it's still some killer work.  how fun to have James back!?!  Hope you dig.
