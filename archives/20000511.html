<DD><b>miremba:</b>  Hey!  I'm in!  The day Joss posted those questions, I immediately said I wanted a Musical Buffy!  (Even before Chris Beck did!)  =)  Sign me up!  (Or I'll go to the form...I guess I should do that, huh?  hehehe)<BR>
<BR>
Well, I am running late, so I have to go.  Thanks to everybody for saying hi and for the great feedback on the new CD, etc.  Sorry we won't be touring before the end of the year, but keep your fingers crossed, and maybe we can tour in 2001!!<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Gotta wrap this up really soon...<BR>
<BR>
<b>chi:</b>  Hi!!!  What a nice welcome!  =)  Have a great time in Daytona, and I can't wait for you to listen to the new CD.  I'm really happy with it!<BR>
<b>greeneyes:</b>  Hi, there!  hehehe....yeah, well hop to it, then!   j/k<BR>
<b>4Paws:</b>  Hi, back!  Things are good, and I hope they are with you, as well!<BR>
<b>devil:</b> Ca va bien, merci!  Tu doit tuer Monsieur Lazy-@$$!  lol  You'll get it soon, I'm sure...but make sure you tell him I'm gonna give him a VERY hard time next time I see him!  ;-)<BR>
<b>cats:</b>  Hey!  =)  Did I ever thank you for my lovely blue ribbons and bells?  If not, THANKS!<BR>
<b>Eleri:</b>  Thank you!  No, no touring plans right now.  *sigh*<BR>
<b>chi:</b>  Forgot to respond...OK!  I'll check it out.  That's cool!<BR>
<b>Sita the Night Goddess:</b> Still busy, but OK...should get going, though.  ;-)  Good luck!  Break legs!  You'll rock, don't worry.<BR>
<b>DeAn:)</b>  Yep, that's usually what it means.  But not always.  ;-) <BR>
<b>KAT in the dark:</b>  Glad to hear it, and yes, it doing well so far...but it could always do better!  hehe<BR>
<b>TheaterGirl:</b>  Hey, you!  How goes it?  I just found a new agent...she wants me to sign contracts next week, but I need to go over them first.  What's up in your acting world?<BR>
<b>SweetJ:</b>Things are cool, thanks.  No touring, though.  And I'm waving enthusiastically back at you!  ;-)</SMALL>

<DD><b>CharlieS:</b>  Cool!  But we'll be on vacation in July, so I don't think we'll have a gig until the END of that month.  Like, the last week.  Glad you like the CD!  And I hope the newly-single thing is good.  =)<BR>
<b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  lol...OK  We're playing at <b>Temple Bar</b> on Wilshire Blvd. in Santa Monica on <b>Thrusday, May 18th</b> at 9pm.  It's a $5 cover charge, and it's also a 21 and over club.  The address, etc. is all posted on our website, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>  The other stuff is that we've signed a publishing deal and also a deal with a music-placement company, so hopefully you'll be hearing more VC in more outlets soon!  =)<BR>
<b>EviLSIT:</b>  Hey!  Cool!  Happy Birthday in advance...  And make sure you set aside June 23rd for the ALL AGES show at the Key Club!  =)  Yay!<BR>
<b>Jasmen:</b>  Have a good day at work!  Yes, Brian's hand is healed...he played with us for the first time last week at the show we did at the Gig on Melrose.  We're so happy he's better!  He'll play with us at Temple bar in Santa Monica, too.  You better come!  ;-)  Glad you had a good time at the CD release party!<BR>
<b>DeAn:)</b>Hmmmmmm...I don't know about that.  We'll try, but that could be considered pushing it, don'tcha think?  hehe  I doubt the "Rejected Angel Theme" will go on the soundtrack, because that was, well...REJECTED.  lol  But maybe they could put Treason on there...after all, that song was used on the show, too!  ;-)</SMALL>

<DD><b>andyourlittledogtoo:</b>  Hi there!  It goes well, thanks!<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Yep, I like that one, too.  But I also really like Medicine Man and You Got Me...  Oh, I like all of them.  Who am I kidding?  lol<BR>
<b>SocKs:</b>  Hi!  I'm good, thanks.  Nope, no new songs on the show as of yet.<BR>
<b>KAT in the dark:</b>  Hi!  Long time no see!  =)  How are you? <BR>
<b>DeAn:)</b>Hey, there!  Well, I'm glad you finally found a copy!  hehe  (You know, it's so much easier just to order them from us...)  No, we're not touring anytime soon.  And if we do, it'll be a US tour first.  But who knows?  We could get a song in a movie, end up getting huge, and tour the whole world! (Hey, I can dream, can't I?) ;-)</SMALL>

<DD><b>CharlieS:</b>  Hi, there!  Well, let's see...as you know, the new album came out last month, so that's cool, and we've been promoting it to press and stuff the past couple of weeks.  We'll see what happens!  Also, we have a show coming up next week in Santa Monica, which will be fun, 'cause we've neevr played at this particular club before.  =) (I like variety, you know?)  There's a bunch of other stuff going on too, but I don't want to bore everybody by going on and on.  hehe  But things are good!  How are you?

over.  Well, some stuff is.<BR>
<BR>
Lurking B-- about your soul, not <BR>
that I'm UNHAPPY with the <BR>
purchase, but you said when I <BR>
OWNED it it would perform certain <BR>
FUNCTIONS, certain necessary <BR>
household functions, open cans, <BR>
julienne certain fries, and so <BR>
far it's just given me a warm <BR>
wooly glow WHICH I ALREADY HAD.  <BR>
I'm not saying i'm gonna return <BR>
your soul, i'm just saying... not <BR>
opening the cans there.  That's <BR>
all.<BR>
<BR>
WOOLY GLOW!  Now in a spray!<BR>

lovely image.  In my haughtiest <BR>
moments that's how I think of me:  <BR>
the eternal stry-guy.<BR>

Jessy:  I actually spent most of <BR>
my life confused about why people <BR>
weren't way MORE excited about <BR>
talking to me, so this feels <BR>
natural.<BR>
Antipodean, forget it.  I can't <BR>
