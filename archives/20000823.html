<DD>To settle any controversy as to whether that was me posting this morning... yes, it was.  Forgot the color codes.<BR>
<BR>
As to why I sounded different to some of you, let's just say I've gone through some changes this summer.  Suffice it to say, from now on, you can all call me "Daphne."<BR>
<BR>
This has been a drive-by.

<DD>TheName - Your critical skills aside, you sure know how to kiss ass.  Keep up the good toadying.<BR>
<BR>
As for the military jargon, the intent was to illustrate the alternate worlds the Initiative guys were living in.  It was meant to accentuate their alter-egos, even if it stretched credulity.<BR>

Thanks, Safarigirl<BR>

<DD>TheName - The scene had my facvorite exchange...<BR>
<BR>
Riley: "Buffy's cool, right?"<BR>
<BR>
Forrest: "Yes, already.  She's cool, she's hot, she's tepid... She's all-temperature Buff."<BR>
<BR>
C'mon... that's good stuff. ;-)

<DD>TheName - Don't back down now.  Yeah, I wrote most of that scene, some of it's Jane.  Wh<BR>

<DD>devilish angel:  yep you're right,  not much press there.  of course this may be good.  he get's his name out there some... familiar face, and that's good.  i mean, once he's done with buffy he'll be at a good time to play older roles.  and since he's not SO identified with the character, xander, he'll might be able to break right in without that preconceived idea of "who he is" (xander)  hanging over his head.<small> run-on sentence much?</small> so maybe no press is good press...?
