<DD>Ack!  Running late, so I'll probably miss people...<BR>
<BR>
Waxy:  Oh, OK.  No worries, and please don't stress so much.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius:  If your credit card won't go through, I can't help you either...but I guess we could try!  maybe my comp will have better luck than yours!  Go ahead and e- me your info, and if it doesn't work, we'll go to plan B.  (I always have a Plan B...)<BR>
<BR>
Wolven:  Eh?  which album info?  The new one is nowhere near finished...<BR>
<BR>
Beth:  no tour plans right now.  =(<BR>
<BR>
Pixie:  I can't really help, 'cause Jeff started the band, not me.  I joined his already-existing band, took over (lol) and they changed the name, st<i></i>yle, etc. around me.<BR>
<BR>
AngelLover24/7:  Don't talk.  Sleep a lot.  Tea, tea, tea.  Honey, honey, honey, and LEMON, too.  NO CAFFEINE.  Gargle.  NO CAFFEINE.  I cannot stress that enough.  Warm liquids.  Avoid dairy.  Lots and lots of room temp water.  And rest.<BR>
<BR>
Hi and Bye to everybody else!  So sorry....<BR>
<BR>
Erika

<DD>Getting ready to go...<BR>
<b>AuroraStar:</b>  Thanks!  Keep those good thoughts coming; maybe it'll work!<BR>
<b>Wolven:</b>  Hey, there!  Life's good, no tour.  New album being developed, however.  =)<BR>
<b>Mesuvius:</b>Just order it from me directly.  I posted all the details to AuroraStar.  And if you'e overseas, the shipping is $3 per item, instead of $1.50.  It's still way cheap.  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Monique:</b>  hiya!<BR>
<b>Beth:</b>  I don't know.  No reason, I guess.  They probably picked all "famous" bands...except for maybe that contest one and Dingoes Ate My Baby/FSM.  I don't know.  I hope I'm wrong, but I have a sinking feeling.<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>  Cool!  do that!<BR>
<b>MystyMage:</b>  You're welcome!  And lol on the Bart Simpson reference...<BR>
<b>Acid Cross:</b>  Cool!  I'll check it out.  And it's stalled, right now, but I think it's still going to happen.

<DD><b>AuroraStar:</b>  Just send a check to:<BR>
Velvet Chain<BR>
137 N. Larchmont Blvd. #535<BR>
Los Angeles, CA  90004<BR>
<BR>
"Warm" is $11.95, the "Buffy E.P." is $9.95, and shipping is $1.50 per item.  OK?  =)  Oh!  and make the check out to FREAK PRODUCTIONS.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  As I just said in my last post, I really wish I knew why you're upset!!!  I hope it wasn't me.<BR>
<b>thy Slayer:</b>  None of the mailing list programs we need are available for Mac, let alone iMac.  It's a long story, but we're kinda hosed.  =(<BR>
<b>Jimbo:</b>  CONGRATULATIONS!  That's very cool.  Is that the same issue my teeny-tiny blurb is in???<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of which, anybosy have that issue and willing to part with it?  They never sent me a copy, even thought they promised they would.  *sigh*<BR>
<BR>
<b>Adina:</b>  hi!<BR>
<b>slay_me:</b>  Hi!  Yes, Elizabeth really enjoyed herself...of course I was doing all the typing.  Gack.  And thanks!  Start a phone-in campaign.  That's usually the most effective for radio.  Pick a song, and request it til you die.  lol

<DD><b>AjO:</b>  Hi!  Long time, no post.  Hmmm...well, I moved, the band's good, working on our next CD, etc.  I don't know what to tell ya!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Beth:</b>  Yes, I remember you!  Just e-mail me when you've sent the stuff.  =)<BR>
<b>Waxy:</b>  Hi!  I got your e-mail today...I don't know why you're sorry.  You're Waxy!  Waxy is an odd fellow.  No worries.<BR>
<b>@llan:</b>  As far as I know, it will be released in October.  However, we have not been contacted at all about it since the initial time, about 9 months ago, so I am afraid we will not be on the soundtrack, after all.  =(  I do not know this for sure, but they never tell you if you're NOT going to be on.  Only if you are.  And I know of a couple of the bands that have been contacted, and we're not one of them.  (Yet?)  I can still hope, I guess...<BR>
<b>CharlieX:</b>  Thanks!<BR>
<b>Jayme:</b>  nice to meet you!<BR>
<b>Acid Corss:</b>  Oh, no...my memory if failing me.  What did she say????<BR>
<b>Hitomi T.:</b>  Hi!

<DD>Hello back to <b>FASTEDDIE, Bruce's Mom, CharlieX, Aurora Star, Winter Rain, AngelLover24/7, and Acid Cross!</b>  I'm doing fine, thanks.<BR>
<b>thy Slayer:</b>  Well...looks like we're dumping the iMac.  =(  It's just not going to work out for what we need it for.  Grrrrr.<BR>
<b>Nad:</b>  LOL...was I harrassing you or something???<BR>
<b>Luna:</b>  I know!  It's supposed to be gorgeous tomorrow and Thursday...and watch for falling props!  I used to like crew, too, but I was always on light-crew, since I'm not afraid of heights.
