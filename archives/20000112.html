<DD>Wow, thanks all for nice comments.  Angelica, horizon, Sasha, swoop, and all.  Sadly, I've gotta go finish this book now.  ;P  As for the next book, horizon, it's the FOURTH book in the Body of Evidence series of thrillers.  It's due out February 1st and it's called "Meets the Eye."  (Spoiler--it's about people who aren't quite as dead as they seem.  Heh heh.)<BR>
<BR>
Good night all.<BR>
<BR>
Be well.

<DD>Slayergrl99--I'm just getting to work on the Spike & Dru novel for next fall, actually.<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen--See, first a tattoo, next you'll be posing nude on the internet.  *weg*  Seriously, though, SotM won't be out until at least teh fall.<BR>
<BR>
MBEnth.--waving back.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Horizon--thanks very much.  I'm proud of both books, but I have to say, as I plot out the Spike & Dru novel . . . you ain't seen nothin' yet.  *s*

<DD>Clover--hi back atcha.  Yeah, Lab's a bud.  A wiseass though.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Swoop--nice to see you again too.  The first draft of the Monster Book (which is f'ing massive by the way) should be completed some time next week, if all goes well.  As for signings, I have none schedule, though I will be signing at DragonCon in Atlanta at the end of June, and at the WizardWorld Comicon in Chicago at the beginning of August.  I'll also, as usual, be at Necon in Rhode Island in July.  Hmm . . . I think that's it.

<DD>MEG!!  *smooch*  Please!  Don't listen to OzLady.  I think tattoos are sexy, I just also know they're eternal.  I would advise my wife against one because I know she'd hate it in twenty years.  But hey, like I said, very sexy.

<DD>MeeB-thanks.  Glad you liked it.<BR>
<BR>
EverDawn--it isn't scheduled yet.  Though the Spike & Dru hardcover should be out in october, I think.<BR>
<BR>
M.U.--IT WAS A JOKE!!!  (on the other hand, all the damned sloppy col<i></i>oring mistakes in that issue were no joke at all.)</SMALL>

<DD>EverDawn--hey!  I'm finishing up my novel Straight on 'til Morning tonight.  I'm pretty psyched about that.<BR>
<BR>
Greengirl--thanks.  : )  Too many nights up past the witching hour.<BR>
<BR>
Kiera & Angus--thanks for the welcome.  I guess I needed my Bronze fix tonight.<BR>
<BR>
Though my little ones are not sleeping well, so don't be surprised if I go poof unexpectedly.
