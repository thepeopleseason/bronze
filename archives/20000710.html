<DD>Blaa - I've never spent any time talking to Jackie, but his stunt double is a friend of mine.  (In fact, he's in the PRIMEVIL episode too)  He's going to play a part in the movie with Sophia this month too.  They are both baddies in it.<BR>
<BR>
Well... thanks to everyone for talking to me.  It's been fun.  For some reason my computer is having some "issues" with the board at the moment.  So I'm gonna really have to sign off now.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again and have a good night,<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Bronzeboy - Then I guess, as Bruce Lee once said, "Why doesn't somebody just pull out a .45 and BANG - settle it."  Of course, he said it with a cool accent and all.<BR>
<BR>
I mean really ... Vamps can learn kung fu, but they can't learn to shoot Buffy?  I always stressed over that one.  Sure she's tough, but not too tough for a good drive-by.  Then again, the show wouldn't be the same.  And it would be reaaaaalllly short. ;)

<DD>Bronze Boy - Okay.  If a rocket launcher is considered NOT a forged weapon, then how about Xander's ice cream truck?  Okay.  He didn't have it back then, but  if Xander had stolen an ice cream truck and driven through the mall to ram the Judge so hard that he flew through the windshield and smashed through the back door in a shredded heap and crash landed covered in Cherry Garcia Flavor Ice Cream. <BR>
<BR>
Did I mention that then some dogs from the pet store could run over and start eating the various body parts scattered about?  <BR>
<BR>
I mean, that's not something you see everyday on TV.

<DD>944 - Hello there.  <BR>
<BR>
Sorry guys.  I just didn't want to leave anyone hanging without answering them since I don't post nearly as much as I used to.

<DD>Okay fine... I was lying.  So sue me...<BR>
<BR>
Blaa - I was on the show from the second season onward.  Sophia has been on the show from episode 1 of season one.<BR>
<BR>
"Dark Angel" is a new tv show from James Cameron that features a butt-kicking chick in a sci-fi situation.  I think it'll be on UPN opposite ANGEL this fall.<BR>
<BR>
dru - Currently the plan is to try out two girls for the first episode.  One for fight techniques and one for gymnastics.  Which one gets to slam back-first into headstones I don't know.  I'm guessing that they will try to settle on one girl later on to save money.  Probably lots of unessecery flipping around and quick cut editing will take place to cover the change in impact and style.  Or maybe a mention in the script about some reason for Buffy to look a little different when she fights.  Something like that.  It'll take work, but it should be cool.  Just not as easy to make as it has been when we could simply turn Sophia loose and roll film on it and go home.

<DD>Oops again.... <BR>
<BR>
Hey BiffyBuffy - Don't worry.  The new stunt coordinator is a friend of mine.  I'm the one who called him and told him about the job being open.  It'll all be cool and the gang*<BR>
<BR>
*sorry for that last bit.  I was just trying to be fly for a white guy.  I'll try to restrain myself.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  <BR>
<BR>
thanks and goodnight<BR>
<BR>

<DD>OOps.  Sorry Dark Angel.  Almost missed the question - Karen Sheperd is the Faith stunt double.  It takes me 15 minutes to choreograph a long fight like that one with B vs. F.<BR>
<BR>
Hi dru.<BR>
<BR>
ihybernate - I also hibernate.  I think I have to start that now.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again and goodnight everyone.<BR>

<DD>Okay.  It's getting late over here so I'm gonna slide off the board now.<BR>
<BR>
Good night to the many from Australia who've been here tonight.  And everyone else too.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Vampr Grrl - I was a bitcha and they wanted to spank me.  So no colorfulness for me.  <BR>
<BR>
I still TYPE IN BIG CAPS.  See.  That's sort of cool.  Sort of.<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Maybe not.  But it is easy to see.
