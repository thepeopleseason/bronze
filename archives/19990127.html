<DD><b>Angelique</b> - - Yikes!  You caught me right on the verge of <u>really</u> having to leave.  Have to call my parents in Texas before they leave for work.  Sorry.  But I promise, soon I'll hang in until your daybreak.  Missed you.  Hope the offspring's birthday was enjoyable and survivable.  Soon?<BR>
<BR>
So gone I can't even hang to catch up with the object of my devotion...<BR>

<DD><b>Goddess Minerva</b> - - Saw your question about what they do at the PBP.  I don't know if my experience at last year's PBP is the norm, but I arrived in town the night before, went to the set where they were filming the night seen for "Killed by Death", hung out and talked to David B. and Charisma for a while between shots, visited Nick in his trailer where he shared a funny story from the filming of "Passion", watched some dailies in the Production Office with R.D. (who was a great host).  Then, the day of the party, had lunch with Joss where we talked about writing a pilot together and he told me the rough story arc for season three.  Then, the night of the party at Planet Hollywood, we mingled, swapped Buffy stories, read each others' name tags to put faces with old names, swayed to Buffy music, watched a gag reel from Buffy, noshed at a buffet, drank at the bar, met Joss, Nick, David, Alyson, Marti, Jeff, Sophia, Seth, Tony, R.D., Kai, Todd (and too many others to remember) as they waded into the place, hid out with Tony and Todd in a little room upstairs and talked about old movies for about half an hour, watched the presentation of door prizes by AKA Becker and the other organizers (didn't win anything), tried to remain inconspicuous in the shadows in a booth (this was after SAR, before "Passion") while being entertained by -mere-, Alex, Angela and others, then snuck out early with my son (my date for the evening) alongside David B., went back to the hotel, ordered room service, called Angela Rienstra at her hotel in Santa Monica, watched "Bean" on Spectravision, went to sleep, then spent the next two days doing touristy stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Again, this was just my experience.  Others may have had a different experience.<BR>

<DD><b>Goddess Minerva</b> - - Thanks for your offer of help in my Natalie Imbruglia/Hanson thing, but the fact is that I actually do greatly admire Hanson.  Just recently, that admiration blossomed into a need to stalk them.  But I just realized tonight that should I get caught stalking Hanson, I had practically written a confession with all my Hanson worship on the board.  That is why I came up with the Natalie Imbruglia red herring, figuring that I could say "Hey, all that Hanson stuff was just an attempt to throw you off my real trail.  I was just using Hanson to cover my tracks when I stalked Natalie Imbruglia."  But, now I see that will backfire, because you will testify that I really love Hanson, which will just bury me.  So, to sum up: the Natalie Imbruglia was a classic misdirection... which is now coming back to bite me in the... end.  Got it?  So please don't back me up on the Hanson thing.  Thanks.  Besides, Natalie is such a money-grubbing (don't look, Sherbear) Aussie, that she <u>would</u> go after your $85.  As for SAR, no apologies necessary.  I am on record several times saying that it remains, to this day, <u>my</u> least favorite "BtVS" episode.  The only reason Joss gave me a shot at "Passion" was so that my wife and kids would agree to be seen in public with me again.  I begged him, "Let me kill the teacher, that should win 'em back."  And it worked.  BTW, you're fun to play with, but I have to go write... the thing about the thing.<BR>

<DD><b>Mike-ff</b> - - Good to see you.  Actually, I'm pretty much mmm bop'ing my every waking moment.  That's Hanson's "mmm bop", not Cyndi Lauper's just plain "bop", which is another thing entirely.  As for what I'm working on... well, I was working on "Zeppo", but after tonight I can see I was wasting my time.  It's already been done.<BR>
<BR>
<b>ANT</b> - - You didn't have to tell me you're British, I could just tell.  ANT is such and English name: you... Adam...  Afraid there's not much I can tell you about "Buffy" that you don't already know from the Board.  When I was in the loop, I used to give away so many secrets that not only did Joss cut me off from the info pipeline, but he also sent R.D. to my house to smash all my tellys (or, as we call them here, "magic noise and picture boxes") so I can't even <u>watch</u> the show anymore.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Weird Scientist</b> - - Don't disparage Hansonline.com.  You can't fully appreciate it unless the have the secret code you get when you send away $19.95 to join the fan club.  It's the only way to access the real bells and whistles - like full motion video <u>and </u>personal messages written by the guys to their biggest fans!<BR>
<BR>
<b>SherBear</b> - - Hanson karioke ignores the fact that what makes the Hanson repetoire magic is the voices of the little angels themselves.  Why do none of you get it?!  To karioke Hanson is to seriously disrespect the little miracles Zach, Tay and Isaac have crafted just for us.  As for what I'm writing... seriously, I'd rather not say.  Developed a nasty superstition about discussing works in progress.  Sorry.  And you finally saw SAR?  Darn, you were one of the last people I could still look in the eye without seeing the contempt there.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Briolette</b> - - So... you're saying I should sue?  Actually, I didn't think about the similarity until you mentioned it.  Now, I see it.  And I'm just pathetic enough to try to convince myself it was homagey.  Ahhhh... Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Aiglos</b> - - I tried to share credit, but Mary's people never got back to me.<BR>
<BR>
Ty<BR>
<small>uh... what comes after penultimate?</small>

<DD><b>SherBear</b> - - Pretty good, thanks.  And you?  I just started posting for a few minutes at a time to leave time for writing.  BTW, why are all the cutest Beanie Babies of animals native to "the Land of Wonder - the Land Down Under"?  <BR>
<BR>
<b>Goddess Minerva</b> - - Actually, the Hanson "thing" is just a cover.  My plan is to someday stalk Natalie Imbruglia with dark and untoward intent.  This way, I figure that if I get caught, I can simply say, "You've got the wrong guy.  I'm a big Hanson fan.  Ask anybody."  So, I'm just leaving an electronic paper trail pointing to my Hansonmania for when alibi time rolls around.  So, you see, there <u>is</u> method to my madness.<BR>
As for your recent PB poll: it has been my experience that any such surveys about the second season of "Buffy", if everyone were truthful, would just turn into big Ty bashing exercises.  Not that I don't love a good bashing, mind you.  In fact, I'm enjoying one as we speak.  And, how are <u>you</u> tonight?<BR>
