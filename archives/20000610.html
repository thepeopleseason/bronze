Thanks Vanilla -- I loved writing for Spike -- and I especially enjoyed getting to write him and Harmony together.<BR>
<BR>
Okay... before I go, let me make sure I understand the concensus -- you all want nudity, am I understanding that?  An all nude episode -- okay... writing that down.<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

Okay, getting ready to take off, but I will tell Mr Whyt that I loved Restless -- I loved especially how it followed the rhythms and logic of real dreams.<BR>
<BR>
And Brandi -- I'd have to say I enjoy writing very much for Anya... love how she lays it on the line.

whitewings and Jenny -- it looks like I'm writing one Angel this year.  How many Buffys?  that's kind of a math problem -- 22 eps, 6 writers... everyone gets either 3 or 4 -- don't know which kind I'll be.<BR>
<BR>
little Wiggins -- I don't really know Bailey, but Marc is great -- sweet and normal.  Other eps I wrote:  Band Candy, Gingerbread, Harsh Light of Day, A New Man.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Faithgirl!

MrW -- the comic is about Super Jonathan.<BR>
<BR>
Closet Buffyholic -- no tears from Joss -- he's a very manly man.<BR>
<BR>
Leanne -- it's a tough time to get into TV writing right now -- too many shows like Millionaire and Survivor, that don't rely on scripts.  But if you can write a good sample script for an existing show and can move to LA, then there's always a chance... heck, I made it, anyone can.

thanks, Chubbybunny!  happy you liked 'em.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Ajo, Hi Jasmen -- the story breakage trundles along at its normal pace.<BR>
<BR>
Leanne -- thanks for the praise re Superstar-- one of the funnest ones to write, btw.<BR>
<BR>
MrWhyt -- yes, my comic book is the Jonathan comic book... my goodness that lad has a rollicking great adventure!

subhuman... well, technically there was a chance that that could happen, but now that you've posted it we'll never do it because then everyone would know we steal our ideas.  Too bad now that we can never never do it.  What a shame.<BR>
<BR>

Well, I knew it would happen... I've completely overestimated my fame.  Those of you who don't know me, I'm one of the Buffy writers (Earshot, Pangs, Superstar etc]...  not really great VIP material, but I enjoy popping my head in here once in a while, lifting the posting restrictions and mucking around.<BR>
<BR>
And... let's see... will I let go of any valuable hints re next year?  No... don't think so.
