<DD>Hola!  Just poking my coconut in to let you all know I have to work tomorrow, so I probably won't be popping in till the afternoon sometime.  But heck, while I'm here, let me clear up a few things I've been reading on the board.<BR>

No one ever said the Knights of B were formed to fight Glory.  They were formed to find and destroy the Key, which as we've just learned has been around for a loooooong time.<BR>
<BR>
Gaping inconsistencies?  Hmmmm...  Maybe.  If the show were being whipped up by a room full of flying butt monkies.<BR>
<BR>
When I stop in tomorrow I'll also clear up some things I said on the Succubus Club, specifically in relation to how the Knights of B located Buffy and the gang.  (No, the scene was never written or shot).<BR>

<b>Green Queen:</b>  Same goes for Japan!  How is it living there??  I've always wanted to visit Asia in general and Japan in particular...<BR>
<b>Sarah's Carl:</b>  It's a two-parter called "Lee Harvey Oswald."  It aired on Sci-fi a few months ago...I'm sure it'll air again soon.  =)  (I'm in both parts...it was originally a two-hour special, and when they split it up for syndication, I ended up right at the end of part 1 and the beginning of Part 2.  hehehe)<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Don't feel left out...I don't have cable, either!  I'm having to impose on a friend of mine to host the viewing!  lol

<DD>Hi, guys...  How is everybody?  =)  I was just inviting a couple of people over for a little "viewing party" for my episode of "Win Ben Stein's Money," and I thought, "Hey - maybe you should mention it at the Bronze...some people might get a kick out of that!"  So, here I go...<BR>
<BR>
<b>"My" episode of the hilarious and brainy game show, <i>Win Ben Stein's Money</i> will be airing this coming Thursday, May 17th at 7:30pm (Eastern and Pacific) on Comedy Central!  I do very <i>very</i> well. You should check it out, if you can, 'cause it's kind of a hoot!  =)</b><BR>
<BR>
Thus endeth the commercial...hehehe
