<DD><vipred>Quick drive by.  Fun was had last nite, overwhelming though it was.  Actually not loving the boardly rumor that I was Waste-athon Bob, since I wasn't, and that means either people are malicious or i'm silly all the time.  I don't generally get hamboned in public, just with close friends.  For the rec.  (Oh, yeah!  And someone said I dance badly!  Unhappily, this is true but jeez!  Ya couldn't keep it to yerself?)  These irritations aside, it was more or less a grandish event, plus I got STUFF!  It's all about free STUFF!  Thanx, guys.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, me.

Driving by...<BR>
<BR>
If you were at the PBP: It was so awesome meeting all of you.  I was truly touched to see the cast & crew hanging out with the Bronzers and everyone having so much fun...<BR>
<BR>
If you were NOT at the PBP: It sucked big time.  You didn't miss a thing.  All the pictures are elaborate hoaxes.  I was there, trust me.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W., your absence caused me to be only 2/3 protected.  Next year we'll shoot for 3/3 OK?<BR>
<BR>
Again, great great great fun.  (Or suck suck suck if you missed it)<BR>
<BR>
Gotta ton of music to write, so I'm off<BR>
<BR>
- Chris

<DD>What do David and I talk about? Well, everything and nothing. It's like asking wht you talk about at the office with a co-worker. Sometimes we talk about work stuff, or news, or golf, but mostly we listen to music and laugh a lot!

<DD>OK, I guess the codes did change.I did meet lots of people, some new and some from last year. The party is really fun, well organized. I was given a vibrating powder puff. But it was all of you at home I thought about. As I kept saying to people, the thanks are for you guys - without whom I would be unemployed!

<DD><vipred> Computer acting up I guess. The party is in full swing. Crowds around David and Tony as I left. The noise is defening, though. Thanks to the "keeper of the earplugs" - they were most appreciated.
