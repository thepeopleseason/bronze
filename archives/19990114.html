<DD><b>VT:</b>  Hehe...well, I haven't tried to e-mail him for a while.  Been busy.  But I will.  I'll make sure he's OK, OK?  ;-)  And yes, we'll have some t-shirts at the PBP.  But we don't have all <i>that</i> many, so find me early.  (I may be optimistic, but we <i>could</i> sell out, right?)<BR>
<b>Little Willow:</b>Oh, no!  the pressure's on!  Ack.  =)<BR>
<b>Drizzy:</b>  If y'all want us back, I'm fairly sure we'll play for you next year, too.  (Unless we're booked at Madison Square Garden or something!  lol)<BR>
<b>AjO:</b>Yep, sure do have T-shirts.  Bring extra money!  (We may have something special of the audio-sort for you folks to buy, too....)</SMALL>

<DD><b>AuroraStar:</b>  Why, thank you very much!<BR>
<b>AngelLover24-7:</b>  Well, I would just order it from us.  We're currently backordered, but we should be getting new shipment in in a week or so.  (For you backordered people, don't worry:  we have a small tide-us-over amount of CD's being picked up this weekend.) So, I'd e-mail me, and I'll give you the details, OK?<BR>
<b>Malachi:</b>Nope...sorry!  (Wish we were touring, actually.  I LOVE touring...)</SMALL>

<DD><b>RyanH:</b>  hehehe...well, give 'em to people!  =)<BR>
<b>@llan:</b>  Well, I think you said you wanted me to send stuff to her.  You did not tell me what.  Nor did you give me her address.  You did say her Mom wasn't into giving out here address.  Just let me know what you want me to do, and if it isn't a huge hassle, I'll do it.  And your stickers went out in the mail yesterday.  =)<BR>

<b>VT:</b>  $8.95 plus $3 s&h.  Use the same address as before.   =)<BR>
<b>NuPhalanx:</b>  No problem!  I'd be happy to send you one...although it's not a band-shot.  It's an 8x10 glossy.  (For acting purposes.)E-mail me with your address, etc.  I'll send it in a day or two.<BR>
<b>Dianne:</b>  You're not crazy!  I used to do torch songs all the time!  Before I was in the band, I did cabaret here in L.A.  It's very natural for me.
