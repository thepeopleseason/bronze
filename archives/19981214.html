<DD><b>RyanH:</b>  I don't know what to tell you.  Didn't I send them out to you twice by now???  Well, all I can suggest is that you e-mail me with your current, absolutely correct and proof-read address, and I'll try one more time.  (Hope whoever's getting them is enjoying them...)<BR>
<BR>
Oh,wanted you all to know, the X-Large Velvet Chain t-shirts are back in stock!  (Someone tell Big Al, OK?)  =)</SMALL>

<b>bec:</b>  Ack!  That is a HUGE amount of cash...<BR>
<b>Pixie:</b>  That is SO cool.  I can't tell you how happy it makes me that I could help artistically inspire another person.  =)<BR>

<DD><b>Pixie:</b>  I'm OK, thanks.  Other than my aforementioned woes.<BR>
<b>Poster FKA Stephen:</b>  Cool.  Well, none of the above, actually.  I was influenced by Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald when I was little, and Duran Duran, the Cure, Teras for Fears, the Polive, U2, Annie Lenox, and Peter Gabriel in high school.  Also LOVE David Bowie.  Want to be like the female him...at least when it comes to Charisma and stage presence...

<DD>Hi, <b>CharlieX!</b>  I'm so pleased you'll be there!  =)  I'm doing OK...although I got a $40 parking ticket today AND ran over a bag filed with broken glass (only in L.A., man), so I may have a flat tire.
