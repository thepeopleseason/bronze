<dd>Well gang, gonna have to be leaving.  Duty calls.  Thanks for hanging with me, and thank you for all the kind words about Lies My Parents Told Me.  Glad you liked it.  Credit James Marsters and DB Woodside for turning in some of the best acting of their careers (and that's saying a lot.) <br><br>Oh wait - here's a fun trivia fact for you.  Even though it's never said on screen (and, as we've learned, should therefore not be taken as canon, but what the Hell, you know?)  Spike's mother's name in the script is "Anne."<br><br>Well, I'm off.  I'll be back soon, though.  We gotta get as much Bronze time in as possible in the next few weeks, you know?<br><br>Minions, as always, you are the reason I get up in the morning.  Without you, I am merely a minion-less amazingly talented writer man-god.  So, good thing I have you.<br><br><br>Goddard out.<br><br>

<dd>awww, ducky, I wanted you all to myself.<br><br>eirefaire . . . ;)<br><br>Coroba . . . I'm sorry, could you elaborate a little further.  I'm not sure I got the full subtlety of your insult.  Perhaps you could put it into word balloons?<br><br>

<dd>Drew . . . a surprised thank you.  It's appreciated.  Though it's coming to a close, I really think you're a big part of the reason this season is coming together so nicely.  I'm not really working on anything to do with the Buffy license anymore, focusing on original work almost exclusively these days, but I still come in and say hello when I'm working late.  :)<br><br>

<dd>Hey -- Christopher Golden's here!  If you're still lurking, "Much respect," as the kids say.  We're big fans of you 'round these parts.<br><br>

<dd>Evening all.  Just making a quick driveby, saw Drew Goddard and thought I should say hello.  So . . . hello Drew.  You're the best thing to happen to Buffy since the high school blew up.<br><br>Going now.<br><br>Night.<br><br>

<dd>I can't believe I missed all this praising of me.  Somebody should summarize it and then make a poster of it or something.<br><br>Caity - Buffy ending is very, very sad for me.  Don't these people know I just got here?  C'mon, let's do seven more years!<br><br>RhiannFire - Thank you so much.  You're very sweet.<br><br>Kathypg - I had a whole "Wrath of Khan" run in there that had to be cut for time.  It's very sad.  And I'm not in charge of wigs, so I can't say for sure.  <br><br>BuffyX  -- Hey, how did you know about Lucien, Prince of Lies?  That was another joke I hated to see go.  Mark my words, sooner or later I'm going to get Lucien, Prince of Lies into a script.   Though that might be kind of hard if I go work on, say, Law and Order...<br><br>Dachelle!  Good to see you.  Got your questions.  I'll fill them out just as soon as Fury stops asking me for golf lessons.<br><br>"Maybe the writers should spend less time playing golf and more time figuring out how you can fill something with concrete AND burn it down AND salt the Earth AND then go back there later."<br><br>
