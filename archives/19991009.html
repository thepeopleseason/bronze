<DD><vaquaA>Eire:  Thank you.<BR>
<BR>
slay me:  A few of my stunt guys work on it and help choreograph the fights too.  They have a seperate stunt coordinator (Spiro Razatos) and fight choreographer (Mike Vendrell).  Usually they all get together and spend a day working out the fights for each episode.  <BR>
<BR>
Mike Vendrell did a lot of the fights for KUNG FU: THE LEGEND CONTINUES and you can see Spiro doing stunts in a restaurant fight scene in a movie I coordinated called: "Martial Outlaw."  He's the bad guy that's a little balding on top.  They are both excellent stunt guys.<BR>
<BR>
Hello again there Spikey.<BR>
<BR>
Falcata:  I forget whether they used a descender or descellerator for that fall.  Both use a cable to lower the stuntman quickly from an overheard cable.   Chris Durand was the stuntman doing the actual fall.<BR>
<BR>
Leanne:  BYE  for now.  Have a good day.

<DD>Zeeshan M:  I'm not sure.  But 5 would give the network enough for syndication.  We'll have to wait and see what happens regarding all of this.<BR>
<BR>
heaven:  we do some (sloppily)<BR>
<BR>
Ajo:  That was done using a device called an AIR RAM.  (It's used to throw the guy on the windsheild of the car in "City of" too)  It launches the stuntman like a catapult.  Mike Massa got knocked out for a moment doing that stunt.  And here is an example of how rumors get started too:<BR>
<BR>
After Mike did the stunt he had to go to N.Y. to finish some shots on another film.  The rumor over at BUFFY was that Mike had accidently knocked David out demonstrating a punch and then he fled to N.Y. to hide out with his family till David cooled off.<BR>
<BR>
The truth is that Mike knocked himself out doing a stunt.  He is from Florida and has no reletives in N.Y.  While he was gone Daivd banged his hand during a fight scene AND had his car smashed when someone hit him in traffic. So he was in a bit of pain for a day or so.    Mike came back to work and so did David.  Neither of them had any idea of the "feud" they were supposed to have had over the alledged accidental punch.   Till I mentioned it.  That's how crazy it is sometimes.  It really does remind me of high school.  David loves his stunt double.  That's his boy.  Sheesh.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meteor:  I did use that nick.<BR>
<BR>
vampslayer:  That was NOT me.  I haven't been to the chat room in a loooooong time.  I try to mostly come here when I can.

<DD>H. Alger: On B2 I had Brad Martin (who looks nothing like David) doing the sword stuff.  The hair dresser refused to even help us by putting on the Angel wig that day and she was fired afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
Mike Massa actually does match David so closely that it is uncanny.  That is his butt you see hitting the ground when David reappears later on from the other side.  That is him with his shirt off fighting Sophia in the woods when Angel has lost his mind.  And if you look closely by going frame by frame at "Dopplegangland" or by watching Angel jump up onto the balcony in "City of" you'll see Mike's face.  He is a great match for David.  But sometimes someone else has had to step in due to schedule conflicts.  He'll be around for the rest of the series now that he's under contract like Sophia.  The only stunt he has had to miss so far on the spin-off is coming up next week - so I can't talk about it.  But it's awesome.  That's all I can say.  And it was done by Chad Stahelski (who doubled Angel in the "rain fight" as we refer to it during the second season of BUFFY)<BR>

<DD>Angle Man:  Those kind of falls are my favorites and I think Joss likes them too.  It is actually easy to do a descender stunt (as seen in the finale' of ANGEL) or to fall through frame into an air bag.  But to be able to fall and bounce off those hard surfaces and crash to the ground in one shot - that is something I can respect stuntwise.  Unfortunately, we rarely have anything to do those stunts with on BUFFY.  Most of our sets are very small and there is not another level to fall from.  I had to move a vehicle and that platform onto the set just for the chance of being able to have something to do a stunt on.  Joss liked it though and he got the shot.  I'm carefully looking for the next opportunity for that kind of thing.

<BR>
Karen Sheperd - stunt double for Faith<BR>
<BR>
Holy Jossoly.  She'll kill me.<BR>
<BR>
PhilPhuD - btw - Karen may be fighting with Sophia in the DARK NEXUS direct to video flick.  I just think it'd be cool to have Buffy and Faith going at it MATRIX-st<i></i>yle AND  show their faces too.

<SMALL>(Sat Oct  9 12:29:40 1999 169.132.153.113)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>hello to B'naa, Leanne, Spikey, Zeeshan M <BR>
<BR>
Angle Man:I can only say that Joss only allows stunts that fit the story he wants to tell.  I was surprised when he let me do the wire gag in EARSHOT getting Buffy onto the roof.  But it fit the story and he wanted it in.  Other times there is an opportunity for great action but he doesn't think it fits or we simply dont' have the time for it.<BR>
<BR>
When I started the show Angel was simply hit in the face with a shovel (by a vamp) and Buffy was saving him.  He had no special fighting skills. As we progressed I kept turning up the heat by adding more Martial arts for him.  Then they started writing that he WAS this tough guy vamp.  And finally when he got his own show David Greenwalt told me that he was now going to be super strong.  (I think this had something to do with the Slayer's blood - but you'd have to ask Joss)  Today he's the coolest action guy on the tube (in my humble opinion)  Angel kicks Hercules butt.  No contest.  hehe<BR>
<BR>
As far as BUFFY this season:  I like the teaser in the episode AFTER the Halloween episode.  That's really all I can say about anyting that hasn't aired.<BR>
<BR>
I can tell you anything you want to know about the fights that have aired though.

samantha:  Haven't done anything for ANGEL except to set up some pads and send stunt guys over to help with fights.  I'm hoping to make an appearance if I ever have a chance to.<BR>
<BR>
The Vamp make up is being corrected on ANGEL.  That was a mistake (obviously)  I t hould improve soon.<BR>
<BR>
Look forward to the PBP2000.

<DD>Beldin:  Will do.<BR>
<BR>
Samantha:  Thanks.  Just BUFFY for the moment (until hiatus)<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man:  Later in the season I may get to do some different things.  For now I'm just jealous that ANGEL gets to use stunt equipment that I'm not allowed to use on BUFFY and he gets those huge buildings to fall and jump from.  Oh well.  Maybe later I'll whine until Joss lets me go wild.<BR>
<BR>
btw - I've not shown my face on BUFFY this season yet, but I can tell you that Sophia and I both appear in the HEPBURN video for "I Quit" which should be out soon.<BR>
<BR>
PhilPhuD - I hadn't heard that (about Sophia) but thanks.  I'll tell her.  She's going to be in another issue of FEMME FATALES very soon.<BR>

<DD>Falcata:  Sophia works so hard doing fights everyday that it is her main exercise.  She rides a stationary bike all the time.  She also does light weight training and kicks the heavy bag around.  She always watches her diet.<BR>
<BR>
shadowbound6:  Hard to fathom.  But the part I read about the projectile vomiting contest sounds accurate to me.  Diagusting, but probably true.  Though Lord knows I wouldn't want to start any false rumor or anything.

<DD>PhilPhuD - We have had no time to devote to it yet.  I did meet with the producers one day recently and they keep pushing me about it being ready in time for hiatus.  I don't know if it will be.  We'll have to see.  At the moment I'm very busy  on BUFFY and they are locked into making this animated film ala' TOY STORY.  We are all hopeful that we will be able to do it though.<BR>
<BR>
I had wondered what your take would be on ANGEL following the Batmanish dark knight super hero idea as I know you hated the Shumacher version of Batman.  I think ANGEL does a better job of capturing the feel of a comic super hero character and has a lot of potential.<BR>

<BR>
Hello Vaal & Brit Angel (whose name sounds like a comic book heroine)<BR>
<BR>
Maverick:  That was Star Trek stunt coordinator Dennis Danger Madelone doing that driving bit.  The girl stunt doubling the Dav character on BUFFY last Tuesday actually IS in the WWF though.<BR>

<SMALL>(Sat Oct  9 11:03:03 1999 169.132.153.113)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Hi.  It's not a big deal, but I just got a couple of e-mails asking me about Sophia being quoted in PEOPLE about Sarah's weight and what that means.  So I guess I'd better come on here and clear up any misunderstanding and give you guys the real story behind that:<BR>
<BR>
PEOPLE called Sophia and told her they were doing a story on stuntwomen and how they keep fit to double famous actresses.  She was supposed to be one of many others.  She told them that she was 5' 3" tall (just like Sarah) and that the studio sent her to have her hair done by the same guy who did Sarah's hair.  She told them that it was easy for her to match Sarah but that she had to be careful to not let herself get too muscular because  Sarah (like most actresses) likes to keep really thin.  They asked her some questions about her diet and training and then about Sarah's diet.  She told them to ask Sarah.  That was it.<BR>
<BR>
Later she got a call from DATELINE.  They wanted to fly her to N.Y. to appear on the show.  By that time she had started to figure out that these people were not interested in stunts at all, but just wanted to get something they could make some gossip out of.  So she turned them down flat.<BR>
<BR>
Joss and I got a big laugh out of the quote from me in EW.  In fact I recieved a hit to the back from him that I am sure must be some sort of "delayed death touch."  I had mentioned to EW that Joss had told me to check out an old Danny Kaye movie in which Danny was barely able to defend himself with a sword and was quite inept at it.  He toyed with the idea of making Buffy that way.  It wasn't that he wanted to turn the final battle between Buffy & Angel into a COMEDY (as the quote made it seem).   But that's how it goes.  He told me that things he says are taken out of context and misunderstood all the time.  <BR>
<BR>
I can't imagine what it must be like for the actors.  Sometimes they must wonder who those people are writing about.  Things WILL always be twisted around to mean whatever the author thinks sounds best to sell the article.  That's usually the way these things go.<BR>
<BR>
btw - It wasn't a "stunt gone awry" as mentioned in the EW article.  It was a trap set by "special fx" - not stunts.  Sophia was simply on the dangerous end of the unspecial effect that night.<BR>
<BR>
thanks,<BR>
<BR>
- Jeff Pruitt<BR>
