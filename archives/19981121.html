<DD>OK I lied.  <BR>
<BR>
Nitanny Lion - 1st job = ghostwriting some music on a (very) little show called "White Fang" (loosely based on the novel).  It aired in Canada and few other countries a few years back, but not the US.<BR>
<BR>
David Fan - I didn't write the theme, and I don't pick the bands.  But feel free to give me compliments on the background music.<BR>
<BR>
Fiona - Thanks.  "Guinevere" couldn't be less Arthurian.  it's a modern-day, slightly twisted love story between an older man and younger woman.<BR>
<BR>
Angelus7 - thanks for the compliments.  David Fan, are you listening?<BR>
<BR>
BuffyBrazil - the A/C is working, which means I should go soon.  (right)</SMALL>

<DD>melanie - I must be great, because I think you mean "is there any movie I wish I could have written the music for".  And the answer is yes, lotsa them.  Basically anytime I see a film I really dig, I wish I could have worked on it.  That's basically all most creative people in the industry want - to work on high quality projects.  (Like Buffy... I thank my lucky stars I get to work on such a cool show.)<BR>

fax1 - heya.  copy away.  and e is coming.

<BR>
opus - see below.<BR>
<BR>
Ahhhhhh....<BR>
<BR>
Can you feel the sweat evaporating from my brow?  Can you hear the lack of panting?  Thank you A/C guy!  Gonna hang around for a bit just to make sure it's working...

<DD>Rabbid Dog - Yes, the producers are always on the lookout for new bands.  I would guess that you're in one?  (By the way I have very little to do with the selection of songs on the show - I write the background music.)<BR>
<BR>
Angle man - lol, and:<BR>
Buffy: French Horn - it's murder to play and her life is so durn hard<BR>
Willow: Piccolo - a cute instrument, with a hint of mischief<BR>
Xander: Trombone - turns from funny to meanie on a dime<BR>
Angel: 3 words: Shirtless, pipe, organ<BR>
Cordelia: Armenian Duduk - just cuz it's cool<BR>
Giles: an old, beat-up, but totally <i>rocking</i> tuba<BR>
Oz: triangle - small, tingly, and doesn't say too much<BR>
Buffy's mom: the ever-nurturing viola<BR>
<BR>
OK?

<DD>Buffy Brazil - ummm... you're wrong.  Not that I <i>dis</i>like Metallica, but I don't recall saying that (or feeling that).<BR>
<BR>
Sorry.  But thanks for the kind words.<BR>
<BR>
Ooh my A/C guy is here.  Relief is at hand...<BR>
<BR>
slay me - thanks.  Next week's ep is indeed a great one.<BR>
<BR>
Gabrielle - I hear ya.  Actually outside it's perfect.  It's just inside, with the sun and all the gear on... baking baking baking.  But not for long!  Everybody say hi to the A/C guy!  Long live the A/C guy!<BR>
<BR>
A/C guy says "hi".  He's not sure exactly what's going on.  Giggling to myself...<BR>
<BR>
And happy birthday Jade! Go to a bar and exercise your right not to drink...

<DD>Dianne - thanks & hi.  I like the tai chi stuff too.  Matches Angel's rippling shirtlessness quite perfectly don't you think?<BR>
<BR>
RJ - The A/C prob is actually a blessing in disguise - I'm taking the rest of the day off as soon as the service people show up.  Seeing a movie with my wife - "Enemy of the State" any good?  Anybody?<BR>
<BR>
? - OK, good enough reason.<BR>
<BR>
melanie- for the-world-as-we-know-it's sake - bonne anniversaire demain!  The movie I'm working on is called "Guinevere".  Starring Stephen Rae, Sarah Polley (from The Sweet Hereafter), and Gina Gershon.  It's a Miramax film, to be released Sept 9 1999, with a preview at Sundance this winter.  (Sept 1999 sure seems like a long ways away...)</SMALL>

<BR>
Slayed Soul, Avarice - heya.<BR>
<BR>
I took a purity test in college.  Don't remember my score.  I took a brief look at the 1500-question test and was promptly overwhelmed with its scope...  It must take longer to take that than the SATs.

<DD>Hey sachiel, I got an answer for ya.<BR>
<BR>
the 2 people I would have dinner with, living or dead, are:<BR>
1) Ennio Morricone (this is really my wife's choice.  He's her hero and it has been her fantasy to meet him since she saw Cinema Paradiso.  Can I bring my wife?)<BR>
2) My grandfather, who passed away when I was 8 and never really got to know.  (An easy one, I know, but sincere).<BR>
<BR>
Am I a man of my word or what?<BR>
<BR>
Melanie- well, besides sweaty & panting, I'm doing great.  The next 4 weeks are going to be a bit insane for me - 3 Buffy's + a film + an album project of my wife's.  (shhh - don't tell Joss)</SMALL>

Good aft Bronzers.<BR>
<BR>
The A/C in my studio is not working and I am <u>cooking</u>.  My equipment started to wig and I had to shut everything off until my A/C rescue team shows up (which I'm told will be soon).  Can't even open a window - I'm on the 5th floor of a building and I guess it's for my own protection should I become "jumpy".  The sun is hitting the windows pretty hard...<BR>
<BR>
So I join you all, sweaty and panting.  Ep 9 will have to wait for now.<BR>
<BR>
Scrolling....
