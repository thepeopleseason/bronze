<DD>J.S.K. Thanks for the tip on the "Ooh La La" TV show.  That one sounds cool too.  This is good.<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob: I guarantee the CD will be worth the wait.  Guaranteed.  Of course I'm about as biased as you can get, but let's put it this way... I'm real happy with what's happening in the studio right now.  <BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius: Yes, most of the songs are written.  Actually, we have enough songs for about 3 albums right now.  In the mean time, new songs come out of nowhere and find themselves in contention.  I'm recording a lot of stuff and developing new things at the same time.  What ends up on this particular record will depend on a lot of things including how the songs fit together.  Sometimes you can have a great song that just does not seem to want to fit in with the others.  So, you save it for later.  A great record is like a 12 course meal.  It has to work individually and as a whole.  I really didn't have a chance to do this on the Warm CD because we were really hurried.  To be honest, the Warm CD consists of the first 10 tracks I was able to produce that didn't have something that really bugged me (plus 3 remixes). Figuring out the tune stack on that record was a real challenge, let me tell you.  <BR>
<BR>
Shadowslayer: I believe you are thinking of a Video contest thing going on with MTV.  We sent in a video of the song "Emily."<BR>
<BR>
Lou Who: I figure Sarah probably doesn't care much if I spell her name wrong.  She's not the type. <BR>
<BR>
Charity aka Taygeta: Thank you for your compliments and good thoughts.

<DD>AngelLover24-7:  Well... nothing in the music business is entirely bas<i></i>ed on talent.  A lot of it is bas<i></i>ed on politics, who you know, and simpley being in the right place at the right time (luck).  I mean, it was total luck when Velvet Chain got on Buffy.  Somebody on the staff saw a gig and brought in the CD and boom, they called us.  At this time, Buffy was just starting out, so we were like, "ok, what's this 'Buffy' thing? Do we really want to be on this show?  What if it's stupid?  Well, we need the exposure, so what the hell."  In the mean time, the show turns out to be one of the coolest shows on television, and we end up with a ton of new fans.  All because 1 guy from the production staff happend to be at one of our shows.  It's crazy. I must say, however, if the band was not very good, we would never have made it onto the show because the people who produce Buffy definitely know good from not good (which is more than I can say for a lot of the music industry).  Remember the band "Presidents of the United States?"  What the hell was that?<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie:  Our gig is actually tomorrow night, not tonight.<BR>
<BR>
PeaceFire:  Thank you so much for the "vote for Velvet Chain for Lilith Fair" plugs you are putting up on the board.  You totally rock.  May I make a suggestion, however.  The voting site is run by xoom.com, which is a lame site.  It's super hard to find Velvet Chain or any other band, once you get there.  I recommend that anybody who wants to vote, go the the Velvet Chain site at www.velvetchain.com and pick up the link there.  We update the link daily so that you end up on the exact page Velvet Chain is on, so you don't have to bang around looking for us (pretty smart eh?) And thank you again.

<DD>Kim!  Please email Erika at Erika@velvetchain.com regarding the SoCal Bronzer ML. Sure we'll join - all day long.<BR>
<BR>
ShadowSlayer: Well, I hardly watch any TV myself (mostly because I'm in the studio all the time) but Erika tells me that Fashion Television is a pretty cool show on MTV.  I don't know much about the "Ooh La La" one though.

<DD>J.S.K. Thank you very much. There's more coming.  Working on the new record right now.  Hoping to get it out around November (it's a long process).

<DD>NuPhalanx: Well thank you very much for your concern. Thankfully the medical crisis is well-over now. You guys sure have good memories.<BR>
Shadowslayer: Well I don't know exactly what Erika's been telling you guys... We did have a new development this week regarding Fashion Television licensing "Diva" and "Watching You" for that show and another one called "Ooh La La."  That was a bonus phone call.<BR>
AngelLover24-7: Thank you also for your concern. I'm back to normal. Regarding Lilith Fair, yes, we're pretty excited about that.  I believe it is the biggest tour in the world right now, and we seem to be very much in the running as far as the voting goes (thanks in large part to all you killer Bronzers voting for us - you're all great).  Also, Sara McGlauglin (I probably spelled her name wrong) knows about Velvet Chain and likes the band a lot (at least that's what Overall Records told me).  Apparantly, her label is considering picking up our Warm album for distribution. Either way, it's my understanding that Sara M. pretty much runs the show when it comes to Lilith Fair, so if we're in the top 10 come judging time, we have a pretty good shot.  That would be a good one... "So what are you doing today?" "Oh... I think I'll have some coffee then go play Lilith Fair in front of about a million people..." That would be a good day - especially for an indie band like us.

<DD>Hi Corvus<BR>
Charlie: Well, I know I don't come around much, but I don't stay away forever.  At least I'm consistent.  <BR>
Kenicke:  Ok, who was talking about be and what were you saying?  How Velvet Chain would be cool if it wasn't for that Jeff Stacy guy?

Driving by...<BR>

I just had to share this.  I don't normally get too freaked out by celebrity sightings in my building (they frequently come by to visit KROQ which is on the ninth floor here) but...<BR>

I saw mini-me!  I saw mini-me!<BR>
