<dd>Gotta go to rehearsal, now...<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Nah...  Now that I've done both "Win Ben Stein's Money" and "Jeopardy," I'm not eligible again for some time.  (It varies from show to show, but it'll be at least a year.)  Anyway, I'm not sure I want to become "Game Show Queen!"  LOL  But we'll see...  If the prize money's good enough, I'm there!  ;-)<br><br>Bye, everybody!<br><br>~Erika<br><a href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank">www.velvetchain.com</a><br><br>

<dd><b>Paul_Rocks:</b>  Thanks!  Yeah, and you know it <i>is</i> very hard to get on the show in the first place, so I shouldn't be too hard on myself...  The categories just came up extremely WRONG and BAD for me, you know?  Luck of the draw!  =)<br><br>

<dd>Well, to quote Weird Al Yankovic:<br><br><i>"I lost on Jeopardy...  Baby...  Oooooooooooooooo..."</i><br><br>Well, I lost, but it was fun anyway.  =)  And at least I made it to the Final Jeopardy Round, so I'll get $1,000 once it airs (3rd place prize)!  I'm so bummed, though, 'cause I *almost* won in Final Jeopardy!  I went into it in 3rd place, but bet enough so that if I got it right and the other guys got it wrong, I'd win.  Well, I was debating between 2 answers, and I picked the wrong one.  And the other guys got it wrong, too...so if only I'd picked the right answer of the two choices my brain came up with, the whole thing would've been on of those great upsets!  Grrrrrrrr... Oh, well. I ended up with a big $1.00 on the board.  LOL<br><br>
