<DD>OK, I've really got to go!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Brandi:</b>  You're not annoying!  YES, we have LOTS of Warm CDs ready and waiting for you to buy!  Go to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a> to order!<BR>
Hi, <b>AjO!</b><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OK, I'm frazzled...um..RSO's to EVERYBODY, and I'll stop by again soon!<BR>
<BR>
Don't forget about the Buffy EP we have for sale at our site, too...(the perfect companion to the Official Soundtrack!)  And hope to see you LA-area people at the lounge-gig on the 10th!<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>
<BR>

<DD>RSO's to <b>SWEETANGEL, PDR, & Icelord!</b><BR>
<b>Cats:</b>  ooooooohhh...thanks!<BR>
<b>LisaMarie:</b>  They used two of our songs, "Strong" and "Treason," on the episode, "Never Kill A Boy on the First Date."  They will be using "Strong" on the Soundtrack CD.<BR>
<b>Brandi the Slayer:</b>  Sounds cool!  I'd rip the frilly junk off it, though.  =)<BR>
<b>GurlGreen:</b>  Sure you can!!  =)  Anyone can.  We're just not going to really promote it.  But I'll tell you guys about it, 'cause you're special.  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Cool, Lounge-type Velvet Chain Gig in Hollywood!</b><BR>
We'replaying at Lunapark, 665 N Robertson Blvd. on Friday, Sept. 10th at 9:15pm  We'll be playing for about an hour and a half...new songs, etc.  It's going to be cool vibe...kinda private-party-ish.  Cover charge is $7  21 and over (sorry!)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Beldin:</b>  Hey, that's totally OK.  I'm actually not even upset about it.  I haven't heard any hype about who DID win, so it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be, you know?  (I mean, they should have performed by now, and I heard absolutely ZERO about the whole contest.)  And I appreciate all the support you guys have given the band!  =)<BR>
<b>OzFan:</b>  Hey, you!  Thanks for the info.  I'll be there with bells on.  =)<BR>
<b>Natalie:</b>  Great!  Yes, we are recording the new one right now.  It's SOOOOOOOOO good.  I'm very very happy with it.  We originally had planned on a November release, but things have gotten crazed, so we'll be waiting til Feb 2000 to release it.<BR>
<b>Hollyn:</b>  Yes, actually...just about every one!  lol  No, really, I like the new songs tremendously.  Especially "Walk On Water," which those of you who have come to a VC show in the past couple of months have heard.<BR>
Hi, <b>Melissa!</b><BR>
Hey there, <b>Brandi!</b>  =)  How are you?

<DD>RSO's to <b>Beldin, Corvus, & Cats!</b><BR>
<b>cabin7man:</b>  Thanks!  I know, people can be so...well...yeah, CHEAP!  lol  Hey!  Did I see somethnkg about a kidlet???  If so, hearty CONGRATULATIONS!  =)<BR>
<b>Fax1:</b>  Oh-my-Joss!  You can actually see us play.  It's a really small, not-promoted, semi-private gig we're playing on Friday, Sept 10th.  It's in a small cabaret-type room - downstairs at Lunapark. (Love the room, actually.)  So, we won't be playing really loudly, but we will groove your @$$ off!  =)  E-mail me for details.<BR>
<b>GurlGreen:</b>  No, actually we're NOT on tour.  We play here in LA, 'cause that's where we're from.  We might get down to SD, though.  Check out our site for gig dates.

<DD>RSO's to <b>Ski, Carl, Bri, Heaven 101, and Buggo</b>!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Heaven 101</b>:  Well, I am honored to be your first!  ;-)<BR>
<b>Buggo</b>:  Thanks!<BR>
<b>Bri</b>:  Nope, not on tour.<BR>
<b>Angelus:</b>  Just try and stay calm.  Nothing ruins a session faster than in-fighting.  Do not stress out. It ruins the creative mood. That's my advice.

<DD><b>Angelus:</b>  Well, right now we're busy preparing for when the Buffy Soundtrack comes out.  Gotta have our gameplan ready, you know?  =) I'm great, thanks, but tired.<BR>
<b>Hollyn:</b>  Thank you!  It's nice to have time to stop by!  No, we're not touring right now.  We're playing a few gigs here in L.A., and working on our next full-length CD.<BR>
<b>Rachie:</b>  Hi!  No worries.  I actually wasn't even aware.<BR>
<b>GurlGreen:</b>  Thank you!   Hopefully, we'll get more press after the BtVS Soundtrack CD comes out!  =)  We currently have two CD's available for purchase at our website.  (<a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>)  They're called "Warm," and "The Buffy E.P."  (The Buffy EP is NOT the soundtrack, but a CD we released on our own, featuring our very own ode to BtVS, a groovy song called "Buffy."  Seth even played a little guitar on the track for us.)  We actually don't currently work on the show.  We were only on the one episode, back in Season 1.  But the cast and crew like us a lot, and we love the show, and we're going to be on the soundtrack (comes out Oct 19th!), so that's very cool.<BR>
<b>Eiddileg:</b>  Man, I'd LOVE to play in Seattle!  We just don't have the money/time to do it.  Hopefully, that sorry state of affairs will be changing soon...<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hi, there!  Yes, it has.  How are you?
