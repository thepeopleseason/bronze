<DD>They misquoted me, Kristen.  I said "insane" with power.  But the best quote was from one of the Chinese extras who, in period Chinese costume but with flat American accent, said, "Gee, I don't see why I have to get stuck with a wheelbarrow.  I'd much rather have a chicken or a goat."

<DD> MelWil: Thats coz I'm Aussie too, and lets face it those bands are excellent. I think Americans would love these bands too but they aren't exported (not even Barnes and John Farnham!)<BR>

MeeB: Thanks! Like I said last weeks episode was a big favorite of mione. Gotta get these MP3s up on RKCC!<BR>

Really like the one with Wes and the Coffin. Is Wes a threat? Not only nailing the coffin but suddenly appearing before Angel, then "You made her go away" LOVE IT (the fan in me coming out here, perhaps I shouldn't use a color for this?)<BR>

Hi everybody!  LP, Angleman, ntmt, Mesuvius et al!<BR>
<BR>
Not staying long, but, Mesuvius, to answer your q... this one was pretty fun to write all the way through... or at least that's how I remember it now.  I'm glad people seem to have enjoyed it.  <BR>
<BR>
And what's this about Dawn never having been there before?  You don't remember her showing up all unexpected at the prom?  And getting kidnapped by Spike during the Homecoming ep?  And the way she was a teeny-vamp in the alt. universe?
