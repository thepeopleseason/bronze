<b>CosmicBob:</b>  I <i>always</i> have the demon-eye thing.  It's due to my enormous pupils.  You may not have notices, but I have these crazy eyes, where the pupil is huge, and the iris is this little blue circle around it.  Only when I have light right in my eyes (Not a flash) can people tell I have blue eyes!  Most people think they're black!  lol  Thanks for fixing that for me.<BR>
<b>Glorendil:</b>  hehehe...you rock.  Thanks for the endorsement.<BR>
<b>cabin7man:</b>  LOL  That <i>was</i> very telegram-like, but a lovely post, nonetheless.  =)  E-mail me when you get/listen to your purchase and let me know what you think!<BR>
<b>aliens:</b>  Oui, pourquoi??<BR>
<b>Labrynth:</b>  Cool!  hehehe

<DD><b>Corporate Lurker:</b>  Okie Doke!  No worries.<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  Actually, all the underlying tracks were recorded first.  The drums, bass and guitar live...attempting to get a solid drum pass.  Once you get that, you move on to the bass, then the guitar, etc.  In layers.  (Each subsequent intrument will play along to the "chosen" recording of the previous intrument.  Building up from the drums.)  The drums took about 3 0r 4 passes.  Bass, about 3, same with guitar.  The keyboards were added in on our home studio's computer, so it's not really as much of a "live" playing situation.  the vocals are put on last, and in this particular case, I nailed it on my very first try.  =)  As for Treason on Saturday, you are correct, we did not play the ending.  Jeff thinks it doesn't work very well live.  I defer to his judgement.  =)<BR>
<b>WitchyWoman:</b>  Yeah, I was glad to meet you, too.  If only plane fares were cheaper, eh???<BR>
<b>DirtySocks:</b> OK

<DD><b>Matsu:</b>  Hi, nice PB person.  =)<BR>
<b>EarthGirl:</b>  Why, thank you!  I know, it is kinda catchy, ain't it?<BR>
<b>Bruce's Mom:</b> 'Allo!<BR>
<b>CosmicBob:</b>  Cool!  (I was wondering, 'cause I went by your picture page, and we weren't there...)  And thanks for the "sucking up."  I'm quite happy for the EP for the same reasons.  I sometimes felt that my voice wasn't captured properly on "Warm."  Would you believe me if I told you "Buffy" was tracked in ONE TAKE!!!!????  The very first take.  I swear to Joss!  Really.  (I'm very proud) We may tour in the Fall to support the next CD, yes.<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Feeling almost completely better, thanks!
