<DD>First, I want to apologize for not getting on the Net sooner, as I am somewhat cyberchallenged (the "DEL" key is "deliver", right?), along with trying to put together a little show (you may have heard of it) called "Angel".  But however belatedly, I wanted to express my appreciation to the fans of "Buffy" for your tremendous enthusiasm and loyalty.  I was truly so very touched (and not by Joss this time).  Thank you for supporting the show and its cast and crew!<BR>
