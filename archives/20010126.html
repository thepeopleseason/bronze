<small>and oh, the very odd things we have occasion to say around here.</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>Corpelia</b>: you still have the WAW?  COOL!  'cause i don't!  could you send it to me?  i'm a little hesitant to post my e- addy, but you should still have it, and if not, ask one of the oldbies.  i'd love to see that again!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Circe</b>: yes, i turned on my computer this morning while getting ready for work, and saw your e-.  and did i really lock myself in the basement?  i vaguely recall that, although  i definitely remember not being able to type the J-word after B2.  sometimes i still find myself making little "meep!" <small>[not MeeB]</small> sounds when Joss walks into the room.  i figure a couple more years and i might actually be able to form a complete sentence when he's around.  like, "i really admire the quality and depth of your MEEP!"<BR>
<BR>
<b>President Blade Sir</b>: um, can i have your abs and chest on MY menu, too?<BR>
<BR>
<small>"Hello, salty goodness!"</small><BR>

<DD>yikes!  down guys!  down!<BR>
<BR>
<b>Lord Mysty Mage</b> and <b>SarahNicole</b>: possibilities (non-canonical, i emphasize) off the top of my head:<BR>
<BR>
1) they only did the revoking spell to shut Cordy up.  which, at the time, was a high priority for our little Scoobs.<BR>
<BR>
OR<BR>
<BR>
2) Lilah's car was a rented car, and thus not her own.  kinda like a mobile hotel room.<BR>
<BR>
OR<BR>
<BR>
3) Lilah secretly pines after Angel and, offscreen, by herself, invited him into every place she ever goes -- her apartment, her car, her grocery store, her Blockbuster, whatever.  as long as Angelcakes shows up and smoochies her.  <BR>
<BR>
<small>"I like the girl.  She's wicked."</small><BR>

<DD>hey y'all!<BR>
<BR>
since i feel like i'm coming home (it being, you know, a "homecoming" and all), i figured i'd return to good ol' fashioned... uh... what the hell is this color, anyway?  beige?  and hey, do y'all remember when the board was blue and the text was white? and how everyone had hissyfits when we switched?<BR>
<BR>
<i>oh, but we were all so much younger then...</i><BR>
<BR>
* i remember when the preview for "Suprise" and "Innocence" aired -- a full three weeks (four weeks?  five weeks? it was a long. damn. time.) before they were broadcast, and i stormed into the Bronze in a leather catsuit, carrying a very, very big gun, and demanded the head of Joss Whedon.  <small>now he says he'll promote me if i ever actually wear a leather catsuit to the office -- but i think he's just using that as a ruse so he can file a new restraining order.</small><BR>
<BR>
* meeting other Bronzers at parties <i>before</i> that mouthful of an acronym, PBPFP, came about.  signing napkins and tablecloths and sending them to Joss.  <small>and now that i'm laying all these things out, i realize that i was, indeed, <u>A COMPLETE FREAK-O</u>!  HOW THE HELLMOUTH DID I EVER GET HIRED?</small><BR>
<BR>
* trading shifts with Ty King, arriving at my office at 7 in the morning, just at the tail end of LOSERs.  Ty and i would rapid-fire post at each other, upwards of, oh gosh, i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say we'd exchange 30 posts or so... <i>each</i>.  in the space of about an hour.  that was a blast.  i miss Ty.<BR>
<BR>
* taking notes -- yes, <i>taking notes</i> -- while viewing a new Buffy ep for the second or third time.  (the first time was for sheer joyful immersion.)  i'd make little notes of things i wanted to talk about on the Bronze: theories, metaphor, characterization, witty dialogue.  all of which, i gotta say, hasn't exactly hurt me in my chosen career.  more than any other influence on this planet, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" made me a writer.<BR>
<BR>
*  the WAW.  oh, lord.  the grief i take for this around the office now.  for all you WAW'ers, i'm sorry.  i left you on a ledge.  maybe someday someone else will... *ahem*... get you off.  of the ledge.  but in the meantime, why not enjoy the festivities? over and over and over again!<BR>
<BR>
* of course, my wedding to my lovely <b>Wifey of Wifelyness</b>, the <b>Mistress of Chic</b>, <b>She From Whom All Fashion Tips Spring</b>, <b>Ccool</b>.  i lovers her so.<BR>
<BR>
* and last, but most importantly, striking up friendships with so many great folks like <b>bookish girl</b>, <b>Ccool</b>, <b>fenric</b>, and <b>Circe</b>.  <b>gypsyrat</b> i already knew from my hometown, so she'll always be my little scummers.  but so many great friends, encouragers <small>[is that even a word?  good thing i'm a writer, huh?]</small>, confidantes, sounding boards, shoulders to cry on... all of the closest, dearest friends in my life, i've found here in the Bronze.  and that's what makes this place so darned special.  that people can find each other, become part of each other's lives.  we don't just send bytes out into the ether here, my friends -- we're sending real ideas, real sentiments, real feelings... to real people.  and from what i've experienced here in the Bronze, really <i>good</i> people, too.<BR>
<BR>
<small>*whew*.  no more sincerity from THIS chick.  i break out in hives.</small><BR>
<BR>
love to all,<BR>
