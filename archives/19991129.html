<DD>Slave2Faith--Actually, the four I wrote were for 7-10 year olds.  They were the junior version of Shadows of the Empire, and the three Choose Your Own Star Wars Adventure books.<BR>
<BR>
Darque Knight--It was easier to sell my first novel than my first comics story.  It's an awful, incestuous, narrow-minded business (comics, I mean), and nobody, but nobody, gets in the same way.  My two suggestions, go to conventions and buy the editors drinks, or move to New York and work for Marvel or DC.<BR>
<BR>
And on that note, folks, I am outta here!!!  Sorry I wasn't more responsive tonight, but I did want to come in and say hey.<BR>
<BR>
Be well.<BR>
<BR>
Chris

<DD>Meg--Evil Willow very definitely counts.  And YAY for yellow fin-head, whose name is Kulak.  Love that guy.  As for col<i></i>ors, we've been over that, y'know.  *shrug* what can I do?  Guess I gotta take up an instrument.  (He says, grinning evilly.)

Lab--selfish thing.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Carita -- the artists hadn't even seen Doyle before that issue had to be drawn.  Sigh.  Other than that, i was very happy with it.  As for the PBP .  . I just can't justify flying to LA just for a party, what with my schedule and family and all.  Sorry.  I travel too much already.<BR>
<BR>
Slave2Faith -- thanks.  Hope you like it.
