<DD>ducky:  On-line chats?  Isn't that I'm doing now? Or is it all just a crazy dream...<BR>
<BR>
tigg3323:  Ah!  Correct!  The truth can now be told!  I'm working on a comic book project with my co-creator/artist Steve Jones.  Man Mountain Jones is an old UC Santa Cruz chum of mine, and has worked on such great animated shows as Batman, Superman, Batman Beyond, and M.I.B.  But don't rush out to your local comic shop just yet.  We are creating this project to be controlled and owned by us, so we haven't partnered up with a distribution company at this point.  I'm working on the first four-issue story arc, Jones will pencil issue #1, then we'll take the whole thing out for a walk and see who offers the best deal.  Best case scenario -- look for it in about a year.  But I wouldn't be surprised if you'll be able read part of the script and view some of the artwork on-line way before that.  I'll keep you all posted.<BR>
<BR>
And with that I must return to work on the animated show.  Thanks again for the help everyone, and I'll see you all next Friday.<BR>
<BR>
*poof, I say, poof*

<DD>Reyna:  Ah!  Damn these tired eyes!  You're right!  Rayne has the script site.  All the same letters, just jiggled around.<BR>
<BR>
Corina:  Hmm... favorite music?  Tough one.  Very broad tastes.  Rob Zombie, Johhny Cash, R.E.M., Heather Nova, Louis Armstrong, Elvis, the Eels...  New characters on Buffy?  Can't say.  But next season's going to be veryyyyy intersting.<BR>
<BR>
One last round, then I gotta get back to work.

<DD>tiggy3323:  Scatter shot, eh?  Pick one and I might answer.  I believe somebody actually hit the answer somewhere on this very board...<BR>
<BR>
Nofetsur:  Title of my first animated Buffy:  The Boy That Got Fired.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You guys just never learn, do ya?<BR>
<BR>
DeAN:) Joss actually makes his on-screen debut in Angel, not Buffy.  I think he's in #21.  You're gonna flip when you see him.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everyone for the kind words regarding "Blood Ties".  For those of you who haven't heard, I'll be dropping by the Succubus Club for a little on-line radio action May 9, the day after "Spiral" airs.  Call up and tell me what you thought.

<DD>Phil PhuD: Is Jinx named after the comic?  I don't know, since I didn't name him, but I don't believe so. <BR>
<BR>
kronos:  Mistaking me for the amazing David Fury?  I'm honored.  <BR>
<BR>
Lyndsay:  Nope!  I'd like to write an Angel centering around whatever charcter Greenwalt tells me to concentrate on.  Like 'em all.<BR>
<BR>
Reyna:  Hey, #1 Rider.  Boo forwarded your message to me about your script site.  Can't wait to visit!  I don't mind you posting my scripts at all.  As for the last four scripts this season -- extra top secret.  Can't send you anything before they air.  If you need a copy of "Spiral" let me know and I'll send it to you after May 8.<BR>
<BR>
Claris:  You have no idea how bad this penny is.  I'll turn on you on a dime and give you no quarter.

<DD>Thanks again to everyone that helped out indentifying The Sunnydale Press.  You guys are my best resource.  Now, some answers to your questions...<BR>
<BR>
The Sci-Fi Bard: I must agree with Writes-Without-Pants.  Has a ring to it.  Plus it's historically accurate.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323: Last clue, then I know you'll get it:  Pictures.  Lots of pretty pictures.<BR>
<BR>
PTB:  There are many deep mysteries surrounding the cartoon.  All I can say is that I believe it will be animated.<BR>
<BR>
DeAN:) The target audience of the animated Buffy is the Saturday morning crowd (i.e. young to teen).  But don't worry, we're writing these with all Buffy fans in mind.  It will actually be a good counter point to the live action show, which is often dark and depressing (which I personally love).  The animated show is going to place a lot more emphasis on action and humor.  As for when the UK will get it -- beats me.  I don't even know when it's going to start airing in the U.S.

<DD>Ahh!  We seem to have a consensus:  The Sunnydale Press.  Special thanks to lan and Rikki.  To show my gratitude, I'll return in 30 minutes to chat for an hour.  Thanks!

<DD>You guys are great.  I'll keep checking back over the next couple of hours to see if anyone can nail that newspaper question.<BR>
<BR>
Nofetsur:  Good guess, but no.<BR>
<BR>
Shameless plug:  For those of you who haven't seen it yet, check out the huge interview with me at The Darkest Night.  The pictures are up now, too.  Here's the site (I'd give you a direct link if I weren't such an html spaz):<BR>

<DD>Yeah, we Buffy writers never stop working.  Heck, it's just too much fun. Keep racking your brains for the name of the Sunnydale newspaper.  I'm not sure, but I think we've at least seen it on Buffy.  Wasn't there a newspaper in David Fury's "Crush"?  Anybody catch the name?

<DD>Hey you magnificent Bronzers, you.  I'm working on my animated Buffy eppy, and I need a piece of information.  Any of you know the name of the local Sunnydale newspaper?  There's puppy dogs and ice cream in it for you if you start talkin'.
