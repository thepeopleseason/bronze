<DD>  Fear not for Giles, <BR>
he too will have cool stuff next <BR>
year.  You're all gonna see some <BR>
changes.  I may bathe.  But more <BR>
importantly, we're commited to <BR>
keeping it in the family, really <BR>
giving the whole ensemble more to <BR>
do.  That's as much of the <BR>
mission statement for next year <BR>
as I can reveal.  But we're <BR>
psyched.<BR>

<DD>Let's talk sweaty.  <BR>
And censors.  (cabbages and kings <BR>
is a different chat room).  Are <BR>
we forced to cut things between <BR>
Willow and Tara?  Well, there are <BR>
things the network will not allow <BR>
us to show.  As for example <BR>
kissing.  Does this bother me?  <BR>
Actually, no, and I'll tell you <BR>
why.  Restrictions are often a <BR>
writer's best friend -- they <BR>
force him to be CREATIVE.  The <BR>
spell scene in 16 was on one <BR>
level a sex scene, on another <BR>
level not.  It was (barely) <BR>
subtle compared to smootchin' and <BR>
rompin'.  The blowing out of the <BR>
candle was lovely and poetical, <BR>
as opposed to the more pedestrian <BR>
smooctchies.  Look at Buffy and <BR>
Riley.  All their sheeted <BR>
shenanegins leave most people <BR>
cold compared to the tension <BR>
between Willow and Tara (not <BR>
EVERYONE, but...)  Part of what <BR>
made Buffy and ANGEL so hot was <BR>
what they COULDN'T DO, becasue <BR>
frustration is sexy and the <BR>
imagination is sexier than <BR>
anything (with the possible <BR>
exception of womanboobies).  <BR>
Buffy and Riley get to have an <BR>
active sex life, we get to <BR>
(tastefully) show it, and it's <BR>
not as compelling.  so go, <BR>
censors.  We love working harder.  <BR>
Makes us better writers.<BR>
<BR>
As for Bufy and Ry, I'd just like <BR>
to say that while lots o' sex to <BR>
the detriment of the rest of your <BR>
life WAS a big part of college <BR>
for many people I know, it wasn't <BR>
for everybody.  ep 18 wasn't <BR>
really about th' sex, it was <BR>
about the fallout from ignoring <BR>
your friends -- i.e. the ignoring <BR>
of people NOT having sex 24-7.  <BR>
So it was supposed to contain <BR>
both experiences.  Uh huh.<BR>
<BR>
Long post.  Many words.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and ep 22 contains a fairly <BR>
amusing way of dealing with <BR>
restrictions.  You'll see.<BR>

<DD>Hey, slave.  You know, <BR>
a lot of my best friends are gay, <BR>
but you probably just haven't met <BR>
the right man.<BR>
<BR>
IN OTHER NEWS, it's been far too <BR>
long since I gloated massively <BR>
about the fact that I know what's <BR>
going to happen on Buffy and you <BR>
all don't.  It's so cool!  We're <BR>
breaking the arcs for next year <BR>
and I actually think you guys <BR>
will be made happy.  And, <BR>
hopefully, miserable.  Of course, <BR>
the most important thing is that <BR>
Willow will be wicked gay but NOT <BR>
AT ALL JEWISH.  And (no, wait, <BR>
this part is true) Much more for <BR>
our stalwart boys, Xander and <BR>
Spike, to do.  No, really.<BR>
<BR>
As for ANGEL, mostly just <BR>
yodelling and towel snapping.  <BR>
Gonna be a let-down.<BR>

<DD>Again I appear, happy <BR>
to see the swell of support for <BR>
th' beauteous Amber.  Interested <BR>
in the theory that the wave of <BR>
homophobia tues night was <BR>
actually a planned effort.  My <BR>
question:  Did they INSTRUCT them <BR>
all to be illiterate?  'Cause I <BR>
found the corrolation between <BR>
bigotry and crappy-ass sentence <BR>
structure to be kind of amusing.  <BR>
(Bad grammer is NOT the same as <BR>
my horrible typing.  Don't lump <BR>
me with those FREAKS.)  Just <BR>
wondrin'.<BR>

<DD>Not much.... time <BR>
left....  must... drive Kai to <BR>
airport...  But... on subjects <BR>
other than my sensitive, noble <BR>
and politically motivated <BR>
commitment to hot girl-on-girl <BR>
action, I've heard some <BR>
grumblings about all the <BR>
pre-marital sex on the show.  <BR>
Personally, I don't see the <BR>
problem.  I believe that <BR>
POST-marital sex is a sin <BR>
(something Kai's getting angrier <BR>
and angrier about -- what's her <BR>
problem?), but as for the <BR>
sweatyization of BUFFY, we the <BR>
writer types just felt that was a <BR>
natural stage in the development <BR>
of young adults.  A college <BR>
thing.  It lacks the tortured <BR>
romance thing, sorry, but it just <BR>
felt realistic.  But don't worry!  <BR>
There's always torure on the <BR>
horizon!<BR>
<BR>
Yay, torture!<BR>

<DD>Just scrolled about <BR>
to read AMBER'S posts.  She is <BR>
the cool one.  As for her extreme <BR>
beauty, well, that's a given.  <BR>
People were dissing her weight?  <BR>
TAhahahhahahahaha.  She is the <BR>
shape of goodness.  Actually, she <BR>
does look even thinner in person <BR>
-- saw her yesterday and thought <BR>
she might be losing weight and <BR>
thought: if she ends up getting <BR>
TV skinny I'll leave the damn <BR>
show.  Her body is... come to <BR>
think of it, I'm VERY VERY <BR>
MARRIED and have NO OPINION about <BR>
Amber's body.  But saying she has <BR>
a weight issue is like saying <BR>
Julia Roberts is too scowly. <BR>
Grrrr.<BR>

<SMALL>(Thu May  4 05:39:24 2000 152.163.204.186)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Okay, let's do this.  <BR>
For real: how @#$%&ing <BR>
disappointed was I in the <BR>
American public after tuesday <BR>
night?  Of course I realize the <BR>
rabidly homophobic posting <BR>
contingent represents a smaller <BR>
percentage of americans than the <BR>
EVIL GAYS they were posting <BR>
about, but that's not it.  It's <BR>
the fact that everyone went nuts <BR>
about it THIS WEEK, when this has <BR>
clearly been going on for MONTHS?  <BR>
Did anyone see the spell scene in <BR>
episode 16?  Hello?  It's the not <BR>
the bigotry that offends me, it's <BR>
the lack of filmic insight.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, and the bigotry.  But of <BR>
course there were just as many <BR>
voices raised in support of the <BR>
arc as against, which was swell.  <BR>
Plus one post from a gay or <BR>
questioning teen saying the show <BR>
helped them is worth six hundred <BR>
hate letters.<BR>
<BR>
And the fact is, stirring up <BR>
controversy is sort of fun.  It's <BR>
just that I never actually set <BR>
out to do that.  To me, jhaving a <BR>
character that is open to <BR>
exploring their sexuality is <BR>
about the same as having a girl <BR>
hero -- just something natural <BR>
and cool.  Here's the word: Tara <BR>
not gonna disappear.  She's part <BR>
of the show, part of Willow's <BR>
life.  i'm not saying everything <BR>
will be sunshine and roses (not <BR>
on MY show, dammit), but there is <BR>
more to explore with the two of <BR>
them.  And hopefully, this <BR>
NONSENSE will die down, because I <BR>
'm not TRYING to make a political <BR>
statement.  I NOD OFF during <BR>
political statements.  My show is <BR>
about emotion.  Love is the most <BR>
powerful, messy, delightful and <BR>
dangerous emotion.  (Although I <BR>
think envy is kind of the <BR>
sexiest.)  Willow's in love.  I <BR>
think it's cool.<BR>

Aly sweet chemistry.  Plus, GUYS, <BR>
Seth leave show!  Do movies!  Oz <BR>
not gone forever, but Seth leave <BR>

when Seth left I turned gay too, <BR>

<DD>Is it safe?  Can I <BR>
come out?<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  Let's be frank.  Last <BR>
Tuesday's episode was pretty <BR>
controversial, and a real <BR>
eye-opener for me.  And despite <BR>
my fervent hatred of criticism, I <BR>
do understand when I've made a <BR>
mistake.  I thought the Willow <BR>
arc made sense for her character, <BR>
but the fact is, most people <BR>
AREN'T  like that, and it's hard <BR>
for most normal people to <BR>
understand a lifestyle that less <BR>
than 10% of the population <BR>
embrace.  I don't want to be <BR>
about issues -- I just want to <BR>
tell a story I think will engage <BR>
and challenge, and this time I <BR>
think I missed the mark.  So I'm <BR>
just hoping people understand <BR>
we're feeling our way along here.  <BR>
We ARE listening.  So we're going <BR>
to shift away from this whole <BR>
lifestyle chioce Willow has made.  <BR>
Just wipe the slate.  From now <BR>
on, Willow will no longer be a <BR>
Jew.  And I think we can all <BR>
breathe easier.<BR>
<BR>
Joss.<BR>

I went online to see what was up and was just flabbergasted, ya know?  I guess I'm still a big kid 'cause it stung.  thanks for the cheer up Kenickie and Crimson and the rest of you guys.

<DD><VRED>  If the color thing doesn't work. I really don't care.  It's not important.

<DD><vgreen>I've been thinking a lot about what people said about Tara on the internet after the last episode aired.  At first, I was very hurt.  I tried to disassociate myself from feeling bad by saying: This is Tara that they are talking about, not me.<BR>
But I couldn't.  I guess it hurts when someone calls you ugly or makes nasty comments about your weight whether or not it is really YOU they are referring to.  I am just a human being and I feel like I deserve to be treated as such.  I also feel that Tara deserves to be treated with a little more kindness and compassion.  Yes, I am not a STICK.  I am a NORMAL, HEALTHY (I was gonna say Girl, but...) WOMAN.  I have breasts and hips and I am very happy that they are part of me.  I weigh 118 and I am 5'4".  If you saw me in real life, you would think I was on the thin side.  But on tv, next to my very petite costars, I do like heavier.  I am PROUD to be NORMAL.  A body is a beautiful thing to waste.  Believe me, I have seen enough of my friends and peers waste away to NOTHING so that they could work in this industry. So that they could perpetuate the LIE that ANOREXIA is Beautiful.  IT IS NOT.  YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.  ALL OF YOU.  Just for being.  You all can judge me and Tara for being 'fat', 'gay' and 'shy'.  I suppose that my being on tv gives you that right.  But I DO NOT have to read what you say.  I have enjoyed being a lurker.  But my feelings just can't take the criticism.  Those of you (you know who you are) with sensitivity will understand.  Thank you for sticking up for us.  Tara and I both appreciate it.  I think that being a beautiful, heavy, lesbian witch rocks!  No matter what happens I'm glad I get the chance to walk in Tara's shoes.  All you girls and guys out there who think that starving, binging and purging and exercising yourself to DEATh is gonna change how you feel inside--  It's NOT.  Don't buy inot all the media crap.  Love yourself for who you are, not what others THINK you should look like.  It's DEFINITELY more important in this life to love each other despite our imperfections.  I hope this works.  Still not sure how to do this whole posting thing...
