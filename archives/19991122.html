<DD>Okay, much as I'd like to stay, some of you have been rightly pointing out that I've been a little "chatty."  (Hey, this is a pretty good time killer when you're stuck at the office.)  So, I'll sign off now.  <BR>
<BR>
Enjoy tomorrow night's eps.<BR>
<BR>
(P.S.  ANGEL will have the men weeping like women.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And the women weeping like men.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(No, I don't know what that means.  As I said before, I'm tired.)<BR>
<BR>
G'nite.

<DD>Always try to get Anya in a script, love writing that woman.  She is in several upcoming eps, including No. 13. <BR>
<BR>
As for Jenny... I miss her, too.  But we haven't come up with any cool ideas for her to make another appearance.  But who knows...<BR>
<BR>
ANGEL's found a way to bring back Darla.

<DD>Kayls -- I let the other writers tell me their ideas, then I pitch them to Joss and tell him they're my own.  Where the other writers get their ideas?  I dunno.  I guess they're smart.

<DD>Calm, Kasey, breath... There are no other crossovers planned at this time for the regular cast members.  (That can change.)  But there may be a guest star cross-over or two.<BR>
<BR>
Will Oz be back?  I can answer that the an absolute, positively, forged in stone MAYBE.  You'll just have to wait and see.

<DD> I think 13 airs the first week in Feb.  Ep. 11, the one I co-wrote with Marti and Jane airs the middle of January.  <BR>
<BR>
As for the writing process, we broke a story on Friday, then today I wrote the outline for it.  Joss and Marti have copies and after they're done reading, I'll sit down with the two of them and get notes.  Tomorrow morning I'll start writing the script.
