<dd>Um, hey!  That's not my color!  I'm not RED.  I'm a lovely shade of AQUA.  What's goin' on?!<br><br><br><br>Wow... Really looks like I'm panicking there, doesn't it?<br><br>

<dd>Hello, PB people...<br><br>Just a quick explanation about tomorrow night's ep. and a certain phone call Willow gets to come to LA.  <br><br>UPN changed the airing schedule during shooting, unfortunately, screwing up our timeline.  (The trouble with crossovers between rival networks.  Neither cares what the other's doing.)<br><br>In any event, I would suggest you view the installment as a "prequel" to last Wednesday's ANGEL.  Okay?  <br><br>Thanks.  That is all.<br><br>

<dd>Hey just wanted to say thanks to <br>everyone for coming out and seeing <br>MOJO.  There were quite a few Buffy <br>fans out the last two weekend and I <br>really appreciate it (if I didn't get to talk <br>to you, I'm sorry!!)<br><br>Also, I will be at next weekends <br>Creation GRAND SLAM in Pasadena <br>(I've been spending a lot of time there) <br>so come and check it ou if you're in the <br>neighborhood.  I'm pretty sure Andy <br>Hallet and I are going to be doing a Q&<br>A session on Sunday.<br><br>Well that's all for now, again thanks <br>everyone.<br><br>James<br><br>
