<DD>Well, that's all from over here.  Remember to take your vitamins, and anything else you see lying around in your parents medicine cabinet, I mean they wouldn't have it there if it wasn't GODD FOR YOU, right?  (See, this is how people get sued.  I WAS KIDDING.  Spit those pills out.  My god, are you people lemmings?  I just said take all the pills in the house and you DID IT?  Are you lemming-people, some hideous race of small furry people with snouts and little forelegs with claws?  Are lemmings hairy?  Raise your hand if I need more sleep).  So, in conclusion, be well, watch Buffy on tues cuz it's earshot (as I strategically inform the only group of people [possibly hideious lemming-people] who already know tues is EARSHOT), and take CERTAIN of those vitamins.  Whew.<BR>

I didn't write the X-Men.

<DD>Why there was no Angel to watch: we didn't make a pilot, since we already had a commitment.  We just started production in the spring.  But reviewers do have copies now... and they love it!  And we bribed them!  Uh, maybe I shouldn't have typed that second part...  no we're not stopping production when Sarah goes to NY.  Great thing about a great ensemble cast, there's plenty for everyone to do so not every scene must have Sarah.  After all, we have to give her some days off to do the ANGEL crossover.... and yes, I think it's gonna be COOL.  And yes, I bribed me.

<DD>See also some emmy talk.  Ah geez, guys, do you have to bring up EVERY sore subject?  Why don't you post about my withered arm while you're at it?  I mean, I'm just trying to post, trying to be one of the guys, and you.... I'm not gonna cry, I'll be fine, I'll just take my withered arm and go.  Oh.  It's not withered, it's just asleep.  Cool.

<DD>See some X-men talk there.  Wanted to let you all know that they are NOT shooting my rewrite.  There's about two pages of my stuff left in the movie and even that's been kinda tweaked so let's get the word out to all the kids that the movie ain't me.  not even a little.

Rum Spike: No current plans but if things go well in the near future you never know. Thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Carita: I may just make it but I'll have to sign-off once there. Too bad cuz it's my old stomping ground! Gotta see it soon cuz someone's gonna blow it for me sooner or later.<BR>
<BR>
Lil'Tree: <i>Willow...you're such a little....TREE</i> *g* Pardon the paraphrase (no more transcipts makes me rusty). I've seen you post here. Nice to meet ya! I pine for the days when MTV used to show (videos) Iron Maiden next to Duran Duran...always had eclectic (yet commercial) tastes in music.<BR>
<BR>
thy Slayer: Hi and Bye!<BR>
<BR>
Julea: Hiya! 1670 kilometers per hour at the equator. *g*<BR>
