<DD>Kenickie--Bristols it is!!!  (Hope that's an old slang term rather than a new one.)<BR>
<BR>
MEGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!--hey gorgeous!!  : )<BR>
<BR>
Slave2Faith--Yeah, I've heard. Heh.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Kenickie--a quick drive-by in the middle of working . . . I need help.  Can you give me some non-obscene slang British terms for breasts?

<DD>Grrrr...my keyboard just froze up and I had to reboot.<BR>
<BR>
angle man--I like what Garth's doing too, but my question is, what happens after?  I mean, without him, it'll be the same old schtick, y'know?  As for my Buffy five parter, I confess I'm psyched with the way it's coming out.  Now if I can just pull off the LAST part, I think I'll actually have written a Buffy novel in comics form. Pray for me.  : )<BR>
<BR>
KeepingFaith--I've HEARD of Easton, just never been there.<BR>
<BR>
NuPhalanx--October!<BR>
<BR>
wiccachick--I'm comfortable with my age.  Hey, plenty of people on this very board outdate me. : )  And Grease is a real guilty pleasure.  Nice to meet you too, btw.<BR>
<BR>
And on that note . . . as Dennis Miller would say, I am . . . ah, you know the rest.<BR>
<BR>
Be well, all.<BR>
Good night.

<DD>SMGFan--thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie--Well, I have to get to know you first.  I'm just not that kind of boy!  Heh.<BR>
<BR>
dog--child genius.  I'll buy it.  Age is relative anyway.  Oh, andyeah, Body of Evidence got picked up by Viacom.  Now we'll see if they ever actually make the damn thing.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius--you could special order from a bookstore.  (suggestions from Golden the Helpful.) And nope, I'm not involved with WG2.<BR>
<BR>
Angleman--yep, that's the right Bissette.  : )  As for comics, TOO MANY.  The new Claremont X-Men was a breath of fresh air.  Some of my favorites are Bone, Strangers in Paradise, Hellboy, all the Alan Moore stuff at ABC, Preacher, Planetary, and the Authority.

<DD>Kenickie--really looking forward to meeting you all.  Very cool of you guys to make the trip.<BR>
<BR>
FASTEDDIE--actually, I'm not working on WG2.  Nancy's doing that one with Jeff Mariotte so that I could work on the Monster Book with Bissette and Sniegoski.<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo--thanks.  Yep, Natick's right down the street.  I grew up in Framingham.  Graduated from Marian in 1985.<BR>
<BR>
VT--whatcan I say, I love Kenickie.  (The one in the movie!  Our Bronzing Kenickie I'd have to get to know better!  : )  )</SMALL>
