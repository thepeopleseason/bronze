I saw <b>Miguel</b> here, and I just wanted to say, Yes, I agree with you about Valentine's Day - and I actually have somebody!  lol.  And <b>THANK YOU FOR MY ROSE</b> last Saturday.  (I'm not sure I ever properly thanked you.)<BR>

<DD>ACK!  OK, what the heck was that about nude photos?  For the record, I have never ever posed nude in my entire life..not even for a boyfriend, or a life-drawing class, or whatever, so if you ever see any, they're fake.<BR>
<BR>
Um, and no, Seth was not posting the other night, and I was not there either.  I posted to clear that up around 8pm that evening.  (Was it only yesterday?  I'm not sure.)<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

<DD>Ack!  Gotta run!<BR>
<BR>
Real quick:  I haven't had formal training, per se, but I've been singing all my life, and have always had that sort of voice.  I was always in chorales, elite madrigal groups, things like that, and my mom was a bit of an opera singer.  (She never pursued it, but she received a full scholarship to the school at the Metropolitan Opera, which she did attend.)<BR>
<BR>
YES, we send stickers all over the world!!!  Sign up!<BR>
<BR>
Might be back later...bye!

<DD>this is the part where I continue to leave.  Yes, Seth is in the new Austin Powers.  We had to juggle abit -- in fact, he is not in our next ep cuz of the movie.  But just that one, he's in all the rest.  I couldn't keep him out of A Powers, it would be wrong not to have him in it.  IT WOULD BE WRONG!  Then my ep, which he's in, and did I mention Willow?  And did I mention leather?

<DD>Since people ask, we're shhoting 18 of 22 this season right now.  If we make it to 22 I will be amazed and confused.  We are all entirely raggedy.  But I'm still lovin' the stories, and my actors are still the best.  Must mention Eliza, who is kicking out the jams in an intense fashion.  As for Spike, i miss him too.  He won't be back for a while (so much going on) but He will be back one day, we have fun planned for him.  We're already deep into planning next season. i'm pumped.  (in a sleepy way.)  By the by, the thought of pics of me dancing w/eliza fills me with terror (me no like pix of me) but curiosity also overwhelming - is there linkage to said pix?

<DD>Tv Guide prints whatever they like.  We have asked them not to be so spoilerish, but we have no power.  Bottom line, the plot twist is sort of a lost art -- TV viewers are supposed to know exactly what they are getting, it's a comfort thing, and Buffy is dedicated to subverting expectations, hence conflict.  But enuf people will see an ep not having been spoiled that I may rest easy -- sometimes.  It's frustrating, though.

<DD><vipred>Hey.  Quick stop in to share my wisdom with you lucky people.  I don't actually have any wisdom, which is sort of a hinderance.  I have some homilies and a knock knock joke.  Pretty disappointing, I guess.  Sorry.  Anyway, hi all.  Would spoilers do?  As for example, someone said last week's ep should be a two parter.  Well, it pretty much is, since next ep deals heavily with the fallout from last week.  Of course, the TV guide gives way too much away, intense GRRR.  And the week after that is something very different.  Something spectacularly Willowicious.  A double scoop, if you will.
