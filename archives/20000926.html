<DD>(dru), hmm can't find the snazzy parenthesis for your name on my keyboard. Umm, I'm barracking for the Aussies, mate! That Cathy Freeman run was fantastic last night. 100,000 singing the national anthem, it doesn't get better than that. Where did they find so many audience members that would know the words?! Yeah, Olympics has been a major distraction!<BR>
<BR>
As for Thomas Wanker, I'll contact him again during the week and tell him he has to post!!! He did a fantastic job.

<DD>LadyMuck. Flinder's University? I remember Flinder's: I did a bunch of freebie music soundtracks for film students there in about 1989, so I could get some experience!. Lots of fun.  I am glad you found the Advertiser arcticle inspiring.<BR>
Best of luck!

<DD>NuPhalanx: I develop the character themes usually by plaing a thematic idea over all the scenes I need it to appear in, and modify it/develop it so it will work over all those scenes for the character, though it might be treated differently each time. David Greenwalt, and the writer for each ep. is usually there at a meeting before I start the music on each ep: and we talk about what the music should do for the scenes that it is needed. This brings me to a spoiler of sorts...<BR>
