<DD>Ack!  One more post...<BR>
<BR>
<b>James:</b>  Well, that's an interesting question.  I think <i>Moody Groove Music</i> is my favorite album, however, <i>Velvet Chain Live at the Temple Bar</i> is cool since you can hear how we sounds live, plus see us on stage in the quicktime video.  And them, of course, there's "Warm," which I would recommend if the person like more rockin', slightly heavier stuff.  That probably didn't help.  lol  Maybe go with the live CD...  =)<BR>
<b>Amberlynne:</b>  Yes, I did.  And I thought he was great.  =)<BR>
<b>tiggy3323:</b>  I just checked out their site!  =)  Pretty cool!<BR>
<BR>
Ok, now I have to go....   Bye!

<DD>Hi back to <b>Dirty Socks & the red hood!</b><BR>
<b>AngelRachel:</b>  I ordered 2 copies (one of each cover), but haven't received them yet.  What a hoot!  =)<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  For work, unfortunately.  Which also means I have to go, now.  =(<BR>
<BR>
Bye, everybody!<BR>

<small>I just wanted to say that I absolutely <i>knew</i> that Spike wouldn't give up the goods.  I think James has done an excellent job conveying that his feelings for Buffy are quite real, and it just made absolute sense to me that he would never hurt her that way.  It crestes some very interesting scenarios/complications for the future, doesn't it?  hehehe  Love it!</small><BR>

<DD>Not much time to post, but...<BR>
<BR>
I loved last night's Buffy!!!!  =)<BR>
<BR>
I would comment more in depth, but I forget how to make my text little.  (For Spoilery-stuff.)  I am NOT a computer-whiz, obviously.  hehe  Is it "little"  or "small?"  I don't want to try one and end up with my spoilery comments all normal sized and have everybody tiffed at me.  ;-)
