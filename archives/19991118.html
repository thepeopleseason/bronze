<DD><i>This is a drive-by to say...</i><BR>
<BR>
<b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FRIEND Elizabeth Anne!!!</b><BR>
<BR>
and to relay a message from her to all the Bronze:  She wanted me to thank everybody for wishing her a happy birthday, and to explain that she's "a total moron" when it comes to computers.  (She can't figure out how to access the Bronze, let alone <i>post</i> and since she doesn't have a dedicated phone line for her comp, I can't talk her through it...*sigh*)  Anyway, I already told her that people were posting their messages to her here, and she really is appreciative.  I'll cut and paste a bunch and e-mail them to her later, OK?<BR>
<BR>
See ya!  OH!  And don't forget, if you're in the LA area, <b>Velvet Chain</b> is playing at the <b>House of Blues</b> on Monday, 11/22 at 9pm.  You can print off a FREE flier from our website.  <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>  Hope to see you there!<BR>

<DD><aqua>Morning, Posters...<BR>
<BR>
Just a SHAMELESS PLUG that there's an exclusive ANGEL comic in the TV Guide Cable Issue (with David B. on the cover), written by me truly.  <BR>
<BR>
Checkit out and let me know what you y'all think.  (Even if you think I should keep my day job.)</SMALL>
