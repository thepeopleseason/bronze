<DD>The density of posts tonight is a little dizzying.  Nice to see so many different opinions.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Angle Man, Kestrel, Matsu, Flip, RJ, Missi (no, don't know about the fan club, but I'll scroll later...)<BR>
<BR>
To all who're disappointed with season 3: don't give up on the show just yet...<BR>
<BR>
I'm off to start ep 8.  (Big episode.  Naysayers, stick around at least until this one airs...)<BR>
<BR>
Horizon aka "percepto girl" - It was briefly recapped in the early part of the show with Buffy & Angel.  It figures much more prominently in B&tB.<BR>
<BR>
Bye to the largest group of Bronzers I've ever seen assembled in one place.  I'll be back when traffic is less dense.<BR>

<b>Fax1:</b>  Yep...and it's going great, thank you. =)  As for Alanis, I too am a lukewarm fan.  EW gave her new album a very solid review...saying, in their inimitable st-yle, that she is "flirting with goodness."  (As opposed to greatness...lol)<BR>
<b>Jonathan:</b>  We haven't sold enough to make any kind of difference yet, (we probably owe $1.50 or something), but let's say a movie or TV show or commercial wanted to use OUR version of Sour Times, well then, there's when we've got to pay Portishead's publishing company.<BR>
<b>KAM:</b>  I a m so looking forward to the PBP '99<BR>

<b>McLatin:</b>  I don't know...I know there is software that works in the opposite direction...turning MIDI into actual sheet musci, but as for vice versa, I have no clue.  Sorry.<BR>
<b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  Well, we don't do covers as a rule, and we only do them if we think we're doing something artistically intersting with the song, and that we've chosen a unique song to cover.  Once a cover is done so that it is well-known, we no longer have any interest in doing it. We're not a cover-band, and we don't like following the crowd.  We'd rather do our own material, anyway.<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Hi!  I'm IMing with Gidget right now, actually.  She got embarrassed after double and triple-opsting a few times...(Apollo even came on to tell her to cool it) so she changed her name to LITTLE E, but then she got embarrassed again, as she felt she kept asking stupid quesitons.  She's not very good at the coherently-experssing-ideas- in-writing thing.  Sh'es better as a spkeaker.

<DD><b>Jonathan:</b>  Covers are very simple, actually.  You don't need permission, you just have to be willing to pay royalties.  And you don't get any money if it becomes a big hit...other than performance royalties, which aren't very much.  You need permission to use a SAMPLE.  "cause you're using someone else's master recording.  But as long as you give credit to the artist and publisher when you record your cover, you're clear.  You just need to pay the royalty fees as they accrue from the millions of albums you sell...lol<BR>
<b>DeMoriel:</b>  No worries.  Let me know when you send it.<BR>
<b>JeffK:</b>  T'were foolhardy of me to throw down the gauntlet to such a one as thee!  I'faith, the muses seem not to gaze upon me with favor so early in Pheathon's journey across yon azure sky...yet, as he drives his worthy stallions toward the West, I can only endeavor to do my level best against such a worthy adversary as thee.  <little>earl grey would be lovely...</little>

<DD><b>Cosmic Bob:</b>  I scrolled, but I don't see the earlier question...anyway, that doesn't really bother me.  You get used to it after playing for a while.  It all depends on the situation, of course.  When I'm  doing a very emotional, quiet song, and it's a smal, intimate club, people talking in thew audience can be distracting and even seem rude, but you know, a lot of people in these clubs are there to socialize as much as listen to the music.  I'm pretty impervious to it.<BR>

<DD><b>rage:</b>  LOL...well, as long as you're not MEAN, I don't think you'll qualify as a bezoar. =)  So, would you say you're into fusion then?  Or prog-rock?  Our drummer is a HUGE fusion-guy...king of the double kick!  LOL...and yet, he loves our stuff, somehow, too.<BR>
<b>Jonathan:</b>  Well, you're right, we don't have any other covers recorded...got to be careful of that.  However, we do a great cover of a French pop tune from the 80's called "Oui, Je L'adore," and a slammin', super-speedy "Strange Brew" (by Cream.)  We also used to do a  groovy version of "World in my Eyes" by Depeche Mode and a beautiful cover of "Man WHo Sold the World" by Bowie...but that was before Nirvana came out with theirs, and I have a feeling "World in my Eyes" is on the new DM tribute album, so those are permanently out of our repertoire.

My muscial influences range from Ella Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby to Simple Minds, the Doors, the Police (& Sting), Peter Gabriel, etc.  How about you?<BR>
<b>Jonathan H:</b>  Cool!  =)  the t-shirt is very cool, actually.  It's two-sided.  The Diva Icon is on the front, over the left breast, small.

I won't be so presumptuous as to divulge his exact age, but he's someone with a pretty good memory of the 70's.  (And no, he's not like 40 or anything, but he's over 30.  OK?  Ack. )
