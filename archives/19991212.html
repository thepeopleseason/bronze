<DD>Inspiration for the badguys: Nosferatu (shreck), Dark City, hellraiser, Nosferatu (kinski), Grimm's Fairy Tales, the Seventh Seal, and Mr Burns.  And much victorian influence.  And yeah, about 29 min without dialogue, scary as hell to pull off, but if I have failed, IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT.  I'm fairly certain.

<DD>As God is my witness, Tracey Forbes says 'oot'.  And speaking of south park, Mr Hankey's Christmas Classics is astonishingly funny and just as offensive as it could hope to be.  Makes me happy.

<DD>Okay, Sita, I signed.  Didn't leave an E-mail, though, don't use it.  And as for what scares me: Death (I make Woody Allen look stoic), insanity, Kathy Lee Gifford (I'm not being cute -- the woman SCARES me), Horror Hotel (anybody in a misty graveyard wearing a hood and chanting -- forget about it), bugs.<BR>
<BR>
The other thing that scares me is -- it's hard to describe.  But I know the badguys in Hush are as close to it as anything I've ever filmed.  I'm pretty excited about Hush.  It was a monster to film and pulled the best (and most exhausted) work out of everyone. And it is, by the by, a Chris Beckathon.  Give him an emmy to go with his emmy.  Did I leave yet?

<DD>SITA, Canadian women are dangerous.  Nothin' but trouble.  When I hired Tracey Forbes, I knew she was FOXY, but I didn't know she had a heart like an ice bucket.  She used me and spit me out (well, oot).  I'll never trust another north-of-the-bor<i></i>derer again.<BR>
<BR>
Editor's Note:  Tracey Forbes has never used Joss Whedon in any way, and his constant insistance that she use him has caused her to file a lawsuit.  However, she does say "oot."

<DD>EviLS I T:  Michelle?  Is that right?  Anyhoo, fraid there's nothing going on over winter break.  That's why they call it a break.  Anyway, we never EVER hire anyone from the posting board anymore, not after a certain SOMEONE who shall remains nameless (but rhymes with Flecker) who frightens everyone with his violent temper, his Lt Uhura outfit and referring to Greenwalt "My little Liebchin".  It's just not right.

<BR>
Daphmax: no movie planned just now, and the show I was developing (about people making cheesy horror films) withered on the vine cuz I couldn't find the right voice for it (though it was fun to work with Ty on something for a while).<BR>
<BR>
clover: Mebbe.  Ahm gwana try.<BR>
<BR>
Myslayre:I wrote a spec Roseanne that got me the gig, and no I was gone before Glenn was hired.  (this was 10 years ago, god help me).<BR>
<BR>
Wolfguard:  I can usually only see a year or so ahead, and there are surprises, but it's all fitting into the master plan.<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's exactly three questions.  Guess I'll head out. Remember, drive safely, but swim like an idiot.  kisses.

I'm just not getting a fear vibe.  I don't know.  Oh well.  I was just stopping in for a little, you know, fear, but instead I will answer THREE QUESTIONS.  COME BEFORE ME and ask, I shall answer but THREE, nothing really hard and no math please.

Umbris!  What a great point!  Ep 12 is always Buffy's birthday.  There will be cake.<BR>
<BR>
And AngelLover24-7 asked if writing for Buffy changed my lifest<i></i>yle.  I recently bought a new Camry.  Does that count?<BR>

<BR>
Someone with motorcycle in their name asked about the writing process.  That has a very long answer.  I suggest you go to the Remarq.com Buffy newsgroup... if you search for my last name you'll find a clipping from the board where I discuss the process.

<BR>
Okay... almost time to go.  But first... <BR>
<BR>
Hi Clover!  Slave2Faith!  Mr Pointy!  <BR>
<BR>
Yes, I'm coming to the PBP!  I hope I'll see you all there!  Fury is waffling on this point, you have to make him come too!<BR>
<BR>
SLAYERplyr -- how does slaying demons made a person more socially comfortable in front of strangers?  I don't see the connection.  Nor do I see how it would keep your heart from being hurt by a charming young man who never called.  Buffy is strong person precisely because she survives heartache... if she never *felt* heartache, well, then I'd say she wasn't human at all.  Sorry if I sound strident, just a pet peeve of mine.<BR>
<BR>
SlayedMyself asked about the hiring process.  TV writers write "spec scripts" -- writing samples written for good shows.  Their agents send the specs to Buffy (unless the spec is a Buffy -- no show reads specs of itself).  The best of the specs are given to Joss to read and if he loves one he meets with the writer and listens to their Buffy ideas.  Then he decides to hire them or not.  My agent sent one of  my (produced) Ellens and a (spec) NYPD Blue to Joss.   I don't know how agents know which shows are looking for new writers.  They just know.

Okay, I know I missed stuff when the board changed but I'm WAY too lazy to go back and look.<BR>
<BR>
Big 'ol "hi there"s to Kendra and W-SKy and LilBufBuf and all of y'all others who I'm too lame to mention.<BR>
<BR>
SWMF wants teeny hints.  Okay.  Something is going to happen to Giles that will make it hurt when he sits.  Also... Look for a turbo-powered botanical item coming soon.<BR>
<BR>
Swoop - I think it was Joss who came up with the quick Amy idea, but I'm not sure.  It might have been Marti.  <BR>
<BR>
SunnyD -- I'm not sure when new eps start up again.  But my next one is ep 12 (Hush is 10).  It's called "A New Man."  Some Buffy web sites give a description of the story -- but they're WRONG!  They're also claiming we have eps in the work called One for Luck and Eye of the Beholder... we do not.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
chi -- I think you're confused again.  (I'm not laughing and pointing, really).  Aly   cries at the end of Wild at Heart, which was written by Marti Noxon.  Pangs was the Thanksgiving ep.  <BR>
<BR>
Phil -- Tracey Forbes is all girl.  And she is a great find.  We're lucky to have her.<BR>
<BR>
You say Kate disappeared?  She's around.  They keep her busy fighting crime.  Look for her in future eps.  In fact, look for her to become very important.  Inconsistancies about pure demons -- I assume you refer to Anya's line about the demons whom we normally see being impure.  Personally, I feel that those demons in the Angel ep only called themselves "pure" because they were less mixed with humanity than some others -- it's a matter of degree.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,  longtimelurker for the praise!  Glad you enjoyed Pangs!<BR>
<BR>
Kristen raises the interesting topic of seeing Angel in flashbacks... hmmm.... that is very interesting...<BR>
<BR>
Brittany wants hints.  How about... who is going to ride back into Angel's life on a motorcycle?

Okay... hope I get the names right:<BR>
<BR>
SunnyD:  Joss wrote the nursery rhyme with his own two eyes.<BR>
<BR>
MySlayre -- I love writing both Spike and Giles, although I find that I have exhausted my supply of British slang... I better read more "Professionals" fanfic, that's where I find the words!<BR>
<BR>
Joe Owl - I know, I hate that the WB is unavailable in many places now.   My parents had to buy a dish, and I know for many people that isn't an option. <BR>
<BR>
And no fear, we're keeping Willow.  We love her.<BR>
<BR>
And Amy?  You want what?  More?  You just saw her!

chi -  actually, Something Blue was written by young Tracey Forbes.  It is one of my faves though.<BR>
<BR>
Melinda -- wow, book-length stuff is impressive.  And personally I think it's harder to write when you're an unpublished author, because no one is waiting for you to finish so they can hand you a check.  Very cool.<BR>
<BR>
AjO -- Hi, we've met before!  Look for Cordy's roommate to appear in an ep soon  -- okay, not *appear* exactly.<BR>
<BR>
And I would guess that at some point during the run of "Angel" there will be a visit from Angelus... can't say if it'll be this year or not.

Phil asked a question about Angel.  It's true, the show did go though a big change with the loss of Doyle.  I'm not sure if you're referring to that or if you're perceiving a certain variation in tone from ep to ep.  It's probably a combination of things -- growing pains of a new show, certainly.  But also a willingness to experiment that I think will keep the show fresh for a long time.  I've been involved in a number of Angel eps... they're very hard to write because the show is so new, but it's also very exciting to feel that you're laying the groundwork for a whole new world.  I hope you stick with the show and give us a little time to dazzle you.

Hi to all those I haven't met before!  Nice to meet you.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Jasmen, you should be very scared.  But there's also big funny.<BR>
<BR>
It's a "very special" Buffy simply because it's very special... I know usually they use that label to mean that it's an episode where Chandler has Leukemia or something... but in this case it really just means that it's... special.
