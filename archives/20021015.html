<dd>Jane: No.  You TOTALLY rock.  I just keep trying to live up to the fine example you set.  And, also, you tell me when to get lunch.<br><br>Drew Goddard: Oh, please.  Kick my ***, my ***.  I'd like to see you try.  You, me, the parking lot, after school.  Come alone.  No minions ('cause, yeah, THEY could kick my ***, easy).<br><br>Allyson: Oh, gracious.  Look what you started.  You can't kick Fury, he'll hate me, and I can't live with the guilt.  But I do like the part about the queue.  Keep that going.<br><br>

<dd>I'm typing this on DrewZ's computer, but it's me, Jane.  Sorry, LovelyBoard... didn't realize you weren't referring to me.  DIdn't mean to stir up all this pro and anti "kitten" sentiment, since I don't know what that is.<br><br>And, btw, doesn't DrewZ rock?  That was such a brilliant statement!<br><br>Whoo-hoo!<br><br>

<dd>Princess of Darkness: We're writers.  We don't have anything to do with promo pictures.  That's why we can't answer you.<br><br>Web Warlock: in my experience, people who cite the dead lesbian cliche in reference to Tara do not understand the cliche itself.  Presentations of lesbians in film and television have historically presented these women as troubled, twisted and desperate.  They were not accepted by society, and the only appropriate ending for them was either to be killed or to commit suicide, thus denying these characters any chance at happiness and, also, providing for the audience a rather clean solution to an embarrassing problem -- how to get rid of the lesbian.  In the character of Tara, we carefully constructed a young woman who was vibrant, alive, self-sufficient, funny, sexy, compassionate, strong and learning to stand on her own two feet.  We wanted you to love her so that when we took her away, the audience would feel her absence as something painful, just as Willow did, and absolutely NOT as a relief, as the cliche holds.  The character was, in my opinion, in stark contrast to and the exact opposite of the old lesbian cliche.  In characterizing Tara's death as yet another in the string of cliched lesbian deaths, you indicate that you do not see Tara as anything but a lesbian, you do not see her as the unique character she was, but rather just as a woman who had sex with women, and, in doing so, you reveal your own homophobia, your own prejudice and, more than anything else, your own lack of understanding of what we did with that character.  Thanks for the opportunity to say so.<br><br>

<dd>Lovely Board, <br>I didn't jump on Warlock because his opinion was different than mine, I jumped on him because he was *wrong*.  The ratings are solid!<br><br>
