<DD>Angelalex - I got 2 presents (so far)<BR>
<BR>
Brad Grenz - nope 99% synth (woodwind solos live, everything else samplers).  fooled ya<BR>
<BR>
ceridwen - I think the WB can only show each ep 3 times.  They may have used up their season 1 eps... don't know the schedule history though.<BR>
<BR>
KAM, Witchy - thanks<BR>

Krissy - I know as much as you guys - which is - nada

<DD>OK, I was scrolling, 2 quick things.<BR>
<BR>
1. Earth Girl,  AleXander - I promise the next time I show up at a SoCal R&R that you both will be there.<BR>
<BR>
2. One result of word getting out that G2 was edited at the WB's request is all kinds of second guessing.  I saw the ep many times both pre- and post- edits and...<BR>
<BR>
SPOILERS FOR G2<BR>
.<BR>
.<BR>
.<BR>
2 changes were made - there are fewer shots of the school blowing up and a couple of lines of dialog at the very end of the show were changed.  That's it.  There are no missing scenes.  If the fight looked badly edited... well, I guess it looked badly edited.<BR>

As for the iMac, it just wasn't going to work for the business applications we needed, so I have a PC now.  (H/P Pavilion 4445)  I'm on the road to recovery, thank you.<BR>

<DD><b>W-Sky:</b>  Hi!  Well, you can order through the post, instead.  Have her get an international money order (made out to Freak Productions - that's our business name) and send it to:<BR>

Los Angeles, CA  90004<BR>
<BR>
The prices are all up on our site, but basically, it's $9.95 for a copy of the Buffy EP and $11.95 for "Warm."  It's $3.00 to send one CD to Europe.  $6.00 for both.  All amounts are U.S. dollars.  Hope that helps!  =)<BR>

As more people enter, we get pushed further back.  The acts with the most votes tend to be toward the last pages, as they were they've been on the site the longest.

<DD><b>CharlieX:</b>  Thank you!  Actually, we're not "way ahead."  That's just on the one page we're listed on.  Right now, I think we're 7th.  Which is GREAT, don't get me wrong, but there are 6 bands/singers ahead of us.  And we need to stay in the top ten until August 1st, which is when the voting ends, and the panel of judges makes their decision.  (Eek.)<BR>
<b>slay_me:</b> It's cloudy today in SoCal...but nice.  See my post to Beldin about the voting deal.<BR>

<b>AngelLover24/7:</b>  Hi!  Well, as I said to Beldin, there are ways around that voting only once thing, but it's not necessary.  I'm hoping we'll win on pure merit!  And I'm alright.  In PT for the jaw, and Jeff's all better.

<DD>Hi, everybody...forgive me if I'm being repetitive...<BR>
<BR>
I need you to do me a favor! We (<b>Velvet Chain</b>) have uploaded an mp3 of our song "Treason," (one of the two songs they used of ours on NKABOTFD) onto the online <b>Lilith Fair</b> contest site at Xoom.com Here's the URL: http://sharehouse.xoom.com/lilith.php3?SH_PAGE=4 Here's a link:  <a target='_blank' href="http://sharehouse.xoom.com/lilith.php3?SH_PAGE=4">VOTE HERE</a> You have to register with XOOM to vote, but it's completely FREE, and there is no obligation whatsoever, <i>and</i> you can unsubscribe anytime. PLUS, you get an mp3 of Treason, if you want! =) (You do not need to download in order to vote, however.) If we win, we get to play an opening slot at the Lilith Fair concert in <b>Chicago</b>! This could be very, very helpful to us, so your support would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance! <BR>

<BR>
Can anyone point me to a site that has the TV Guide type summaries for the episodes?  The ones on this site (buffy.com) are too long.  I need one or two sentences.<BR>
<BR>
And thanks everyone wishing me a happy birthday...
