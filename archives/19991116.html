<DD>  Sorry, Wyatt.  That was a bit of a kneejerk post.  We're very sensitive.  But my reponse was out of line.<BR>

Hey, Wyatt... yeah, you.<BR>
<BR>
Please stop worrying so... vigorously.  Joss and David are very conscious of what the fans want.  They're trying very hard to deliver it.  Oz leaving was beyond our control.  We wept, verily, as thou.<BR>
<BR>
Developments on Angel... well, all I can say is I hope you're all as pleased with the results as we are.  We're trying very hard to make it the best show possible.  As someone's mother used to say when serving the brussel sprouts... how do you know you don't like 'em if you haven't tried them?  You haven't seen the very eps of Angel that have disappointed you so very much.<BR>
<BR>
Please, give us a chance... let us make the eps before you make us feel that we've let you down.  We take your remarks very much to heart, and we're genuinely trying to do what we think you'll end up enjoying the most.<BR>
<BR>
Joss and David do this for you guys... trust me, you're in their heads and hearts.

<DD>  Hey, Wyatt -- Appreciate your opinion, but a couple of things... With due respect to Glenn Quinn, it's the WRITERS who bring humor to the show.  Doyle's funny, because we write him funny.   And when you address the CREATORS, it's MR. Whedon and MR. Greenwalt.  SHow a little respect to the people who bring you quality television every week.

Hey Fury!  Taking a break from the writey.  I already finished the great scene where Giles does the thing and realizes the thing and then jumps out of the thing and then Buffy does that other thing.  The fans are gonna love it.

Okay... getting ready to leave, but one more quick thing in reference to a much earlier post.  In case anyone is confused, RIley and Buffy still have no clue about each other's secret identities... I know it might've looked like he saw her, but he didn't.<BR>
<BR>
Okay... I think I'm gone...<BR>
thanks for the praise, I will pass it along to Doug!

A few answers:<BR>
Cordy doesn't know Doyle's a demon... that's why she whacked the spiny guy... didn't know it was him.<BR>
<BR>
"One girl" is not a code-phrase... it was just a voice ID, anything would've worked.<BR>

If you were supposed to understand everything about the Initiative then you would have been sent little pamphlets... Joss will reveal all.  *g*<BR>
But let me just say that my father is a professor in a  university lab that's funded by  the US government.  It happens.

About the captions being wrong.  I would guess... and it's a guess... that the closed captioning people are sometimes given either an earlier edit or a script that hasn't been changed to reflect the way scenes were recut.  I bet the number was in a previous draft/edit of the ep.

Actually, I have no idea how long the Initiative has been up and running... the fact hasn't been established.  I'm just guessing cuz that's what it feels like to me.<BR>
<BR>
About the amount to which Joss has planned the season?  Oh, a lot.  And a lot of next season.   This is good to keep in mind b/c some "oversights" people are complaining about  are, in fact, carefully planted set-ups for future events!

Oh yeah, new opening credits.  Do I put spoiler warning on that?  Guess not.  Yeah, cool, huh?  I think Spike looks great!   He's a regular now!   <BR>
<BR>
BTW, too much credit sailing my way... all the credit for last week's ep goes to Marti.  All the credit for tonight's goes to Doug Petrie.  I'm just here to marvel with the rest of you... wasn't it cool?

Okay, see... she really did think they were wild dogs.  She told Riley because she probably everyone she saw that day.  Wild dogs!  Freaky.<BR>
<BR>
And I don't find it unbelievable she's never dealt with a werewolf... I have to believe it... I saw it!  Let's say the Initiative has been up and running... hmm... six months... that just six times three = eighteen days of possible werewolf activity.   Sounds plausible to me.

Hi y'all!  Weren't those great eps?  And so glad to see that my pal Doug Petrie was finally here posting, collecting his kudos!<BR>

Did anyone/everyone recognize the vamp in the next cell from  "The Freshman" (season premiere)?

Lady Pol... because she thought they were two wild dogs.  The Initiative is new, they just prob. never met up with a werewolf yet.

<DD>Hey guys me again.  Just so all viewers north of the bor<i></i>der know - the "Maybe she's Canadian" line was our way of welcoming Toronto native Tracey Forbes to the Buffy writing staff.  I put it in as a joke, and it made it onto the air!  Don't be offeneded - it's a compliment - honest.

<DD>Hey, I'm back.  The line got a little muffed, it's "Finn, Riley," not "Ben Riley."  And okay, the Initiative isn't the most realistic endeavor on TV, but what can I say?  Long time 007 freak.  I had fun with the ep.  Oh, and Xander's "Military Guy" skills are starting to fade.  Magic's funny that way ...
