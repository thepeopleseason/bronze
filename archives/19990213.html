<DD>Gotta get going soon...<BR>
<BR>
<b>Anais:</b>  no, unfortunately.  We have no funding, so touring even locally is tough.  As for Canadian bands, I've heard of a few, but I'm not super familiar with their music.  (Eve6, Our Lady Peace, etc.)<BR>
<b>Beldin:</b>  Thanks!<BR>
<b>mudpuppy:</b>  Oh, yes, I definitely sent those orders out already.  You'll get it any day, I'm sure!  =)<BR>

<DD><b>Little Willow:</b>  Hi, there!  Well, you do whatever you want!  you're totally a co-writer on the song, and you can say that 'til the cows come home.  Shout it from the rooftops!  It's up to you.  =)  As for the artists on the E.P., it was Jay Stolmack who played Saxophone on Lvin' Ain't So Easy, Brett Albrecht is how you spell the name of the guest keyboardist, and Diana Lorden played Violin on I Don't Care.<BR>
<b>SarahW.:</b>  LOL...not really!  I was so busy, I missed just about everything.
