<dd><b>ducky:</b>  Well, a bunch of people were snapping photos of me and Jeff, so I'm sure there'll be photos...I'm just not sure how incriminating they'll be of me, since I went home around 1:30am.  Jeff, on the other hand, went to an afterparty, and didn't get home til almost 5am, so I'm guessing the incriminating photos will be of him!  hehehe<br><b>Watchers_Council_Member:</b>  Hello!  Yes, still recovering.  Jeff's still sound asleep, actually. ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  Oh, and to answer your question, the last show we did was the big one with <b>The Tubes</b> in December.  We're busy working on the new album and trying to work out a deal with this new label, so I don't know when our next live show will be.  I'm in another musical, though, and that keep me very busy.  =)<br><b>DeMoriel:</b>  Thanks!  I'm super nervous about the Jeopardy thing...  Eek!<br><b>abt:</b> Cadbury's dairy milk. =)<br><br>

<dd><B>The Great One</b>  Hello!  I'm fine, thanks!  A bit tired, and I sound kinda like Elmer Fudd, but good!  ;-)<br><b>numba1buffyfan:</b>  Howdy!<br><b>Princess of Darkness:</b>  Awwwwwwwww...  I'm sorry!  Well, maybe you'll get to come over and meet everybody at another event!  I'm sure things will still be organized over here in the future, even if it's not an "official" PBP.  =)<br><b>valMichael:</b>  Cool!  I'm so glad you got that.  I think it's a nifty thing to have.  I just love the warmth of vinyl, you know?<br><b>Beldin:</b>  You know what?  I almost preferred not performing!  I could just hang out and chat and not stress about losing my voice or anything!  hehehehe<br><br>

<dd><b>Amarra:</b>  I had a great time, thanks!  But the band you saw on WireImage was Darling Violetta.  They did a great job, as usual.  =)  Jeff, Marc, and myself were all there from <b>Velvet Chain</b>, but we didn't perform this year.  We were guests, and we did have a merchandise table set up, but basically I was able to just hang out all night and talk to people and listen to he bands and stuff.  I had a blast!<br><br>

<dd><b>Princess of Darkness:</b>  LOL!  I <i>just</i> e-mailed you not 30 seconds ago!  The PBP was great fun, thanks!  I'm just sorry you couldn't make it.  There were a bunch of people from other countries there, though...  Including <b>DeAn</b>, who brought me come lovely chocolates from England!  Yay!  How are you?  Not too sad about missing the party, I hope.  You have to do what's right for you, and if you didn't feel safe, I think you were smart not to risk it.<br><br>

<dd>Hi all!<br><br>Well that was a great party last <br>night. And a FANTASTIC grand <br>total of $30,000 for the Make A <br>Wish foundation.<br><br>It was great to see a few <br>different stars that don't usually <br>show up also, like Julie Benz <br>and Eliza Dushku!!<br><br>And to those at SOUR GRAPES: <br>YOU WERE RIGHT, they WERE <br>out of Doritos, I got back home <br>about midnight and I was <br>positively starving.<br><br>Any Aussies at PBP this year? I <br>didn't see any...<br><br>

<dd>Hey, everybody!<br><br>Just got home from the PBP, and I'm so sorry they didn't have any computers so I could say hi from the actual event, but I wanted to say hi now.  So, <b>HI!!</b><br><br>A good time was had by all - or at least, that's how it seemed to me - and now I'm home, but Jeff's still out doing the afterparty thing.  hehehe  I have rehearsal for a musical I'm in in less than 12 hours, or I'd be there, too!<br><br>How was the party around here?<br><br>
