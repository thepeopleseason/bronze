<DD> Ooops.  "luch" is actually "lunch."  I've never eaten a luch to my knowledge.  Though I am will to try.<BR>
<BR>
WG - The nerve pinch has been copyrighted by Mr. L. Nimoy.  Perhaps if Buffy uses her feet instead .... yeah.  That could do it.  But then she'd have to take off her Buffy boots first and clearly that is a copy of BILLY JACK.  So that's out.<BR>
<BR>
I want to imitate the monster glass shattering mall fight with a multiple falls from the upper deck that is seen in POLICE STORY.  That would be fun.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, take care.<BR>

<DD> New Fan - Hello to you and thanks for watching.  kiiiiaaah!<BR>
<BR>
Carita/Manx - Though my cooking is horrible to behold, I will try it.  <BR>
<BR>
Mysty Mage - Jennifer Badger did that one I think.  I can't be sure.  Badger usually doubles Cordelia, but we have her double lots of others too.<BR>
<BR>
elusio - okay.  I'll show.<BR>
<BR>
Well... gotta go and eat luch now.  Sophia made tuna sandwitches and if I stay on the computer she is liable to give me one of those "looks" if you know what I mean.<BR>
<BR>
Good to see you all.<BR>

<DD>kingofbab - Don't know just yet.  We are going to discuss it next Saturday.<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - Brian Machleit (who used to double Wesley) does the Riley stunts.  I don't appear on camera.  <BR>
<BR>
Here's one bit of info:  I did build the rig for the long exterior "floating" shot in my garage and set it up between two 50 ton cranes.  It was the most expensive rig I've had to do on BUFFY yet.  Too bad there wasn't time to show it all.  I had those guys float for over 400 feet.<BR>
<BR>
Annie - season 2 we had the Angel double break his collar bone at the ice rink when the huge demon landed on him.  Also Sophia broke her index finger while blocking a punch during "Becoming Part 2" and had to do the entire sword fight with a broken and unbandaged hand.<BR>
<BR>
In season 4 Sophia and the Sunday stunt double connected and both had to have X-rays.  Sophia's fist cought her in the forehead during that final punch with full force.  Usually we just tap each other lightly, but that time it was full power all the way.  So the punch you see on film is actually a real one.<BR>
<BR>
Destiny - Spiro Razatos is the stunt coordinator and Mike Vendrell and Mike Massa (Angel Double) and the other stunt guys choreograph the fights.<BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Beasley - It's something easy for actors to do and allows us to get a nice close-up.  So that's why you see so many head-butts on tv.  Plus, censors don't seem so uptight about it for some reason.

<DD>Vaal - Thanks.  I started the show on season 2 and I started trying to change the fights towards what we do now about mid-season.  So near the end of season 2 till now is more of what I like.  I hope you will too.<BR>
<BR>
MedusA - Hello and a gigantic MENTION to you!  Please put me in your file.  Please.  I want to be near Jane Espenson.  Due to the fact that she is one of the genius-types that write the scripts.  Plus, she's only eleven years old.  I'm hoping that by standing near her I can stay young.<BR>
<BR>
Icelord- I only pray that it is Chris Beck.  He makes all the difference.  I watched my friends on MartiAL LAW the other night and I couldn't get over that typical CBS riff going on in the background.  Yikes!  They need Chris.  He really sets the mood and propels this show.  He's great.  (Though not as underage as Miss Jane)</SMALL>

<DD>elusio - I plan on being a t the PBP if at all possible.  It's the one chance I get to actually see some of the people that I talk to on-line.<BR>
<BR>
kingofbab - I meet with them on Saturday about it and plan on shooting the first bit on Sunday with Sophia.  We plan on playing all of the characters and putting the actors faces on us.  The interactive folks say that it will be pretty realistic and they want it to represent the show as close as is possible.<BR>
<BR>
cordy2 - Not true.<BR>
<BR>
Narrator- Well... not really;)</SMALL>

<DD>Vaal - I choreograph all of the fights and stunts for BUFFY.  I don't do ANGEL though.<BR>
<BR>
SAM - "Doomed" looks pretty good and has a couple of good fights in it.  I can't really say anything else about it right now.<BR>
<BR>
arthur - I couldn't really say anything about that either.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, I could say that we swallowed a lot of dust during one particular fight before Christmas.  It's coming up soon.  Not much of a spoiler there... sorry ;/

<DD>Carita - Good for carl.  I was so afraid that he'd moved on to Brittany Speers or something.  (Just kidding carl)<BR>
<BR>
Everdawn - Sophia is feeling rested now that she's had the Christmas break.  She starts fighting again next week on the show and I'm sure it won't be long till she's worn out again.  Especially since we are going to try to shoot the Buffy and Angel Playstation Games on the weekends now.  That'll mean zero days off for her for a while.

<DD>Vaal - Good.  Very hectic, but good.  I saw that there are a bunch of people on the board that I've never had a chance to meet before, so I thought I'd stick my nose in here and say  "Hi."

<DD>Hello to all on-line Scoobies.<BR>
<BR>
W-Sky:  Bai Ling's stunt double is named Mei.  She is the Wu Shu teacher of some of my stunt guys and a Wu Shu Forms Champion.  She has recently started stunt work and has been doing the stunts for Nia Peeples on WALKER: TEXAS RANGER.  She is leaving that show, however, to double Lucy Liu on the new CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie.  (They are planning on making the Angels into Buffy/Hong Kong/Matrix-st<i></i>yle fighting chicks for the new film)  <BR>
<BR>
How is everyone today?  I was wondering if carl still liked Sarah or not.  This worried me to the point of losing sleep over it.<BR>
<BR>
well carl... are you out there?
