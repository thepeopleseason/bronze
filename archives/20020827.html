<dd>Okay gang – Mr. Goddard has to get going.  Dachelle, I’m so sorry to leave just as you get here.  We’ll have to coordinate that better for next time.  Let me give a quick address to my Minions:<br><br>Faithful Minions,<br><br>It is I, your leader.  Please keep these simple things in mind:<br><br>1. You are my Minions.  This makes you better than other people.<br>2. Never be afraid to point out #1 to other people.  Both parts.<br>3. I am very proud of all of you. <br>4. Your love of me informs me that you are all great people.  Nice job.<br>5. You will all encounter good fortune simply because you follow me.  Congratulations.<br>6. In addition to good fortune, I believe we now all qualify for some sort of tax break.  So that’s nice.  Every little bit helps, right?<br><br>Every little bit helps.<br><br>Ultimate Drew<br><br>

<dd>Dachelle!  Thank goodness you’re here.  I may have to stay a little longer now.  <br><br>Crack! Ow!  Joss, stop hitting me with that whip.  Wait, actually hit me one more time.  Firm, but with a little sting on the crack back.  Ahhhh, there we go.<br><br>Allyson -- sweet.  Love me that David Fury.<br><br>Impaler – speaking of Angel – good lord that team down there is talented.  Jeff, Mere, Steve, Liz, and Sara are all just hitting it out of the park with every episode so far.  Gonna be a great season.<br><br>SlayerNextDoor – my episode is being directed by the genius David Solomon.   I’m so glad he’s doing it.  He’s amazing.<br><br>Holy crap!  Look how many Minions I have!  I’m going to have to start getting nice things for all of you.  Dachelle, how can we make that happen?<br><br>

<dd>Okay gang, one more round and then ol’ Drew has to go back in the mines.<br><br>Shadow – read Kavalier and Clay.  One of the best books I have read in quite some time.  Lovely Bones starts very strong but ends with a whimper.   And Happy Birthday!<br><br>BlackMagickBitsy – Here’s a little writing tip for you.  Whenever I feel like a scene is moving a little too slow, I throw in a monkey.  And usually I have the monkey doing something sort of human – smoking a pipe, working on his taxes, cooking dinner.  You’ll be amazed at how quickly the pace picks up.<br><br>SlayerNextDoor – It made my day that you were here as well.<br><br>Hey – now Drew Greenberg just walked in.  He says hello.<br><br>(That Drew Greenberg is really smart, by the way.  Sometimes I think lightning shoots out of his brain.)<br><br>Halfrek – how can you say that you are ONLY Minion #3?  Babe, you’ve been there from the beginning, and don’t think ol’ Drew has forgotten that. <br><br>Impaler General – I think it’s entirely possible that we might try to fool people hell bent on spoiling our season.  We’re deceptive people.  We promote sex and violence and the occult.  Frankly, we’re just not good seeds.<br><br>Black Sparrow – boy, you’re listening to a lot of music.  And thanks for the Dawn support.  I think you’ll like what we’ve got planned for her this season. <br><br>Tralf – I would be honored to be immortalized in bitty form.  I’ll see what I can do.<br><br>

<dd>I tell you what – there’s nothing better than talking books, music, and Buffy.  Thanks for all the recommendations.  You guys rule.  Let me throw a couple your way:<br><br>The new Distillers album is awesome.  It combines my two favorite things in the whole world:  girls and punk rock.  The Vines new album is fantastic (did anyone see them on Letterman?  Good Lord, was that lead singer ever drunk.)   The new album by The Used – also pretty good.  <br><br>Old Man Fan – I’d have to say I’m better at the sex than the violence.  <br><br>Impaler – That was actually Golden Age Drew who talked to Aint it Cool News.  <br><br>Comteacher – I just finished Visual Basic 6.  I thought it was even better than Visual Basic 5.<br><br>Smiley Face – that’s a funny question.  I have no idea if I’m related to any Nova Scotians.<br><br>Newt – Looks like my episode will be episode five.  <br><br>Christopher Marlowe – I wouldn’t miss being on set for the world.  I mean, c’mon, it’s my first Buffy episode.  I gotta take lots of pictures for my mom.<br><br>Halfrek, Tralf – Picture of me?  That’s a little weird.  I mean, if I give you a picture, then I can’t go to the grocery store or the mall without women screaming and knocking me down and ripping my clothes and… would an 8 X 10 glossy be sufficient?<br><br>Genevieve’s Lucie – okay, here’s a little something I can tell you: if the Parents Television Council is pissed now, wait until they see what we’ve got for them next season.  Whoa boy.<br><br>BlackMagickBitsy – Why are you trying to write slow?  Just try to write good.<br><br>(See, there’s a little joke there.  ‘Cause “write good” isn’t actually… see…)<br><br>(Damnit.)<br><br>

<dd>What’s the deal with this Sex2K/Goth Sex show?  Sounds pretty good.  Is Billy Ray Cyrus in it?<br><br>Ojagwers – There’s nothing you can do to fight the Parents Television Council and their backers.  So just join in.  <br><br>In fact, why don’t we all start a watchdog group of some sort?  I’ll tell you one thing – I do not approve of the things they show on Sorority Life.   Those girls don’t seem to know that sororities are about sisterhood, not loose-sex and boozing and backstabbing.<br><br>Jane Espenson can do a wicked Jordan impression, by the way. <br><br>Anyone heard any good music lately?  Read any good books?<br><br>

<dd>Yeah, this whole PTC thing has forced us to change next season.  I hope you guys like Billy Ray Cyrus, because you’re about to get a whole hell of a lot of him.   Crap, should I have put that in the spoiler font?<br><br>Christopher Marlowe – I’m trying to get other writers here as we speak.  They’re all very busy figuring out how to cut out all the sex and violence in next season and replace it with heartfelt lessons about conservative christian values.  Can anyone mail us some Highway to Heaven scripts?<br><br>Molly – my website is wonderful and horrifying at the same time.<br><br>Halfrek – I’m doing great, thanks for asking.  We start shooting my episode tomorrow, so I’m just about as happy as can be.  Oh, and please give my best to Dachelle.  I miss her.  We never talk anymore.  We’ve grown apart.  How is she?  Is she starting fanclubs for anyone new?  Is he better looking than me?  <br><br>Hey -- Jane Espenson just popped in my office.  She says “Helllooooo!” to you all.<br><br>That’s actually exactly how she said it.<br><br>

<dd>Did you guys see our #1 Worst Show ranking by the Parents Television Council?<br><br>We’re so distraught we can hardly work today.<br><br>
