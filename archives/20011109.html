<dd>Destiny:  A monkey’s gotta have some fun.  Ouhh ouhh eee eee.<br><br>Tiggy3323:  Order the lobster!  Order the lobster!<br><br>Shade of Bronze:  Thanks for the kind words.  And hey – read more comics!  That goes for all of you.  There’s some great stuff out there, and not just for kids.  Ah yes, the short form musical.  A lot had to be cut out, from what I understand.  I think that includes the Overture,  Bunnies, What Can’t We Do When We’re Together, part of Rest in Peace, all of Dawn’s ballet, and bits and pieces here and there.  I know that sounds terrible, but just remember that UPN took a big loss in advertising by airing the full version on Tuesday.  Plus you’ll get the full one on the DVD.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  You so need to move to LA.  During the day, you still don’t need a jacket here.  No news, just working hard.  And hopefully working on your interview soon!  (Yeah, I suck.  It’s true).<br><br>V_Slaybelle:  Happy bunny, happy Steve.  Circle life.<br><br>Carita:  So far it’s a good morning.  Now I just have to wait and see what deviltry Kirshner inflicts on me today.  No!  Rebecca!  Not the salad tongs!<br><br>UHP!  Meeting time!  I’ll try to stop by later.  If not, see you all next week!<br><br>

<dd>Narrator:  I’ll see what I can do about that pony.<br><br>Biobabe:  Your omniscience is starting to spook me.  I totally suck.  I promise beyond all reckoning I’ll watch it this weekend.  Man do I suck.<br><br>Selwyn29:  No, your life is fine.  Yes, the Buffy/Angel undertones were intentional.  Anya’s speech was meant to have a two-fold impact:  freak Xander out and make Buffy sad (well, sadder than usual).  She also met the one person she was meant to be with – but the universe didn’t allow them a happy ending.<br><br>Newt:  Your best bet’s the Manwich.  In television, the writers are the ones that run the show.  The writers are almost always the creators/producers.  We’re the ones that are always here, day to day, running the show, while directors are hired on a per episode basis.  Which is not to say that directors aren’t important – of course they are.  Very.  Just as important as writers on a feature.<br><br>Tiggy3323:  I haven’t asked about what yet?  And yeah, you suck, but not quite as much as me.  Tell Ergoshakes and Paks I said hi right back.<br><br>Dave:  I’ll work on that blackmail footage. Here Joss Joss Joss…<br><br>Artemis:  You were fine.  Newscaster a big idiot.<br><br><br>UHP!  New board – sorry if missed any of you.<br><br>

<dd>Immortal:  Every day is a meeting day – we’re just never quite sure when it’ll happen.  <br><br>Comteacher:  I am a man of many talents.  Sadly, the Golden Voice isn’t one of them.<br><br>Kiba Rika:  I’ll check that out soon as I’m done here.<br><br>Cashmere:  We’re about to start breaking ep. 14, which will be written by either Rebecca Kirshner or me.  On the animated front, I just finished my third script and might do one more before the smoke clears.  Can’t wait to see those on the air.  Extra cool.  Joss was very pleased with the fan reaction to the musical.  And hey!  I saw Allyson and some of you guys on the local 13 news!  You guys were great – but the reporter was a total idiot.  Grrrr.<br><br>

<dd>A fine Friday to you, Bronzers.  Not sure where I should be posting these days, so at least for the moment I'll stick to what I know.<br><br>I'm going to be in meetings all day starting in about an hour, so here I am all bright and early.  Wake up!<br><br>
