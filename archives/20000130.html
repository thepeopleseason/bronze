Okay, really really going now.  But quickly:<BR>
<BR>
Kristine did move to Italy.  But she's moving back here in 5 months.  Also... we can fly her back any time we need her.  That's right.  Any time we need her.<BR>
<BR>
Demon-watcher -- that's right, I do have a degree in CompSci... and every bit of what I learned is obsolete now.  No one ever asks me to write Pascal programs to add columns of numbers or anything.  <BR>
<BR>
Okay... leaving.  Bye all!  Thanks for all the fun!

Kestrel...I believe  it was more than that.  Angel was also warned that a big bad is coming to L.A., something that's going to require vampy strength to defeat it.<BR>
<BR>
Oh yeah... about Anya being a replacement for Cordy.  Well, they do serve similar comedic purposes in that they both lack inner voices distinct from their outer voices.  But they are very different girls.  Cordy would never talk about sex like Anya does.  I also think Anya thinks about others more... observing them and this strange new life she's living, while Cordy was more self-focussed in this way.<BR>
<BR>
Kestrel... Buffy indeed has that scar and I'm sure Riley has seen it.  I bet he asked and she just dodged the Q.<BR>
<BR>
maryloye -- no, Buffy really did forget she hadn't told him.  I know I do this all the time... think I told someone, when I actually told someone else.  It's part of how marginal she had let him become in her life.<BR>
<BR>
Jennifer!Hi!  I still have my band candy wrapper!  And I don't get to vote for the Oscars, just the Emmies.  But if you want an unofficial pick... I liked American Beauty a lot.   (also Galazy Quest, but that's a long shot.)</SMALL>

Okay... getting ready to leave now.  Gonna print out this last draft of my next ep and read it to myself... see if it's golden brown or merely half-baked.<BR>
<BR>
Vox... sorry... I have nothing to do with picking music for the show.  Joss and Marti are FAR more musical than I am.

Wicked Wicca... I don't think I belong in that club exactly... because I get plenty of Buffy and never have to wait through reruns.  I'd feel hypocritical.  <BR>
<BR>
Arielle:  I'm the opposite.  A deadline forces you to write.  I hate knowing I could be writing movies in my free time... because if no one makes me do it... it's not gonna happen.<BR>
<BR>
Angelicious -- sorry.  I'm originally from Iowa (that's why I made Riley from there)  But young Tracey Forbes is from Canada.

Oops... some of you have reminded me you may not have seen A New Man yet.  Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
SPOILERS AHEAD:<BR>
frothy commented on Riley's competitiveness.  I really didn't see it that way.  It was about Buffy being worried that he would be intimidated...  in fact, he was initially merely surprised (and bruised) -- which she misread as intimidation, and then later, he realized that he was intrigued by her strength.  And his final challenge... I'll take you down.  I don't think he was even talking about fighting.  He loves her strength.

Lost Angels -- I find Anya incredibly easy to write for.  Mostly because I'm kinda tactless myself.  I mean, I think there's a level where we all feel like ex-demons plopped down into a world with a lot of stupid rules.  Right?

Ooh... Angus has a good question.  See, the ep was long and a lot of stuff got caught.  I don't remember if it was clearer in the long version, but the answer is that Buffy made Ethan do a spell to reverse Giles' transformation.<BR>
<BR>
Also, something kinda important was cut.  We shot a scene AFTER Spike hits the loading dock, totalling the car.  He gets out.  He says (realizing)  "I can kill demons.  I can crash cars.  Things are looking up!"  And he walks off jauntily... escaping capture.  Wish you all could've seen it... it was cute.

Some random answers:<BR>
<BR>
I think my next ep airs in March some time... not positive about that.  It's ep 17, maybe you guys can figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
About calculus... just remember that as the imaginary slices of the area under the curve approach zero thickness, they more closely fit the function and they approach the total area under the curve.<BR>
<BR>
My fave scene to write?  I loved Giles and Joyce listening to music in Band Candy.  I loved Buffy reading everyone's mind in the library in Earshot and I loved Giles and Ethan talking in A New Man.  Also... a couple fun ones in my next one.  These characters are such joys to write for!

Thank you newfan and others who enjoyed A New Man -- I love getting to write for Giles and I took great joy in establishing his hatred for Maggie.<BR>
<BR>
Okay...my next ep is a craaaaazy ep.  I mean craaaaaazy.   (I can't give anything away... but... I hear that although no actors are being hurt in the making of the ep, one of them is being shaved.   Wait... how can that be true?  Am I lying?)</SMALL>

Hi Poet!  Hi Kristen!<BR>
<BR>
So weird to have a fan club.  As Ethan said: Here's to  me! (or something like that -- Joss wrote that line -- he writes all the good ones)<BR>
<BR>
Bob -- hard for us to get to a breakfast since we've been starting work at 9AM instead of 10 this year.  But it sounds great.

Hi Clover.  Some good advice on test-taking.  You remember stuff best in the room where you learned it.  If it's possible, go to the test room early and study there.

Hi gazoo.  My Sunday was good.  Had a pizza delivered, watched the closest Superbowl in many years, finished a script rewrite.  All good things!

That was a sincere "too bad," by the way.  Not a gloaty too bad for you 'cause I already know what's going to happen too bad.

<BR>
So, I guess we're in reruns this week?  Too bad.

<DD>I sense myself leaving.  Britany Spears will not repeat not be appearing on Buffy.  However, for the second half of season 5 the role of Anya will be played by Boyz2Men.  Be well, be good, be brave.  Begone.

<DD>Slave, once again you've got it exactly right.  Good to know people understand.  And no, I won't be doing any mime work in the future.  Truth is, i was drummed out of the mime academy for my baggy tights, my sloppy face paint, and for my incessant talking and use of props, which for some reason is a big mime no-no, personally I looked a lot more like I was puling on a rope with my rope and my cries of "I'm pulling on this rope" than those other guys did.  I guess i'm still bitter.  The Canadians will sotthe me...

<DD>I forgot, in all my frenzy talking about my show, to talk about ME and that's why I've returned.  I had to mention (and this is not a joke) that I am king of all people (oh I guess that did turn out to be a joke, but I think this next part is true) and that I am working on my first Comic Book for Dark Horse.  What fun for me!  Me!  All about me!  (well, what am I supposed to do, post about you guys?  I don't even know what you look like, except for -mere-, and she always hides behind dark sunglasses and the curled smoke of a french cigarette, never truly revealing herself, speaking in a low frech growl, actually i'm not even sure that WAS -mere-, it might have been some french girl).  I wrote the first issue over Christmas break.  A challenge.  A new medium.  (Following in the footsteps of Fury and Petrie, yah yah).  It's not a Buffy comic, it's gonna be a limited series about the Slayer some 500 years from now.  It'll probably take the better part of a year to get out there (some poor schmuck has to DRAW it), i'll keep you posted.  'Cause I'm awfully excited.

<DD>I've been scrolling.  I've seen a lot of comments about my somehwta controversial posts and I just have to go on record once and for all:  I do not hate Canadians!  I have nothing but affection and deep respect (and dark, uncontrollable urges) for Canadians.  I have in fact recently composed a very beautiful anthem, goes like this:<BR>
<BR>
CANADIANS,<BR>
CANADIANS, <BR>
CANADIANS,<BR>
WHY NOT?<BR>
CANADIANS,<BR>
SO VERY PRETTY<BR>
(sensitive accoustic guitar break)<BR>
CANADIANS,<BR>
CANADIANS,<BR>
EVERYWHERE TELLING ME TO KILL IN MY BRAIN.<BR>
<BR>
It's sort of "Jack and Diane" kind of a feel.  It really rocks.<BR>
<BR>
So I hope I put that issue to rest once and for all.  Meanwhile, a bunch of people mentioned I was freer with info, spoilerboy, and it's true.  Partially, I have just given up the idea that I can keep a secret anymore.  In this our modern era, with these new fangled comuting devices and horses made ENTIRELY OF METAL I just know it's a losing battle.  Also the things I'm giving away aren't exactly plot twists.  The whole Giles-dies-in-the-arms-of-Snyder's-evil-clone thing would be a plot twist, and what are the odds I'll mention that?
