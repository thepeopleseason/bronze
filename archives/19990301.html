<b>Mandi:</b>  Yep, I'm a VIP...or at least, that's what they tell me!  lol  I was on an episode of Buffy back in the first season, with my band, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">Velvet Chain</a>.  Check out our site!  =)<BR>
<b>Mike Thomson:</b>  Sorry, that was me.  I typed in my special password incorrectly...it will be changed in a few minutes, by the ever-vigilant Apollo, so don't worry...<BR>
<BR>
Bye, everybody!  Don't forget about the FREE Key Club tickets, and tell all your friends about the Buffy E.P., OK?<BR>
<BR>
Bye!<BR>
<BR>

<DD><b>Corvus:</b>  Well, good luck on your CD-hunting!  =)  (If you have trouble finding it, just order it from us.  We send them out very quickly, and we're even cheaper than the stores!)<BR>
<BR>
Yes,yes, Nerf Herder wrote the theme song, which ROCKS, btw...BUT!  WE wrote the first-ever Buffy-theme-song with words!!  Hehehehe.  I mean, Did she have a James Bond-type theme before us?  I don't think so!  ;-)</SMALL>

<DD><b>Corvus:</b>  Yes, actually we're working on the next full-length CD right now!  You have the Buffy E.P. already, I assume?  (And "Warm," I hope...)<BR>
<b>Mike Thomson:</b>  Nope, ni ICQ.  And I believe there's a computer on the set, that the  cast/crew sometimes check out.  (When they have down time or whatever.)</SMALL>

<b>Jasmen:</b>  Well, that is VERY sweet of you!  We have a few people helping us (thank Joss!), but I'll let you know if we ned to take you up on your offer.  I just asked Jeff, and don't worry, your request is all set.  We're actually not sending the bulk of them out until Wednesday or Thursday.<BR>

<DD>Oh-oh!  Things are getting a little distracting here...ack!  I may have to jet.<BR>
<b>Mike Thomson:</b>  Hmmm...to clear things up, my name is Erika.  Eliza plays Fiath on the show, and I haven't had the chance to meet her.  I don't keep tabs on the whole cast, no, but I'm sure most of them are on set right now shooting the show.  Our music is sort of teip-hop/rock/pop.  Hard to describe, but very groovy.  =)<BR>
<b>ripley:</b>  Hey!  See ya on the 19th, right?  I put your tix in the mail today, actually.<BR>
<b>Blackheart:</b>  Why, thank you!  the muse is fine, thanks.<BR>
<b>Pixie:</b>  Sure!  no problem.<BR>
<b>Paris_Angel:</b>  Well, if you sent it last Tuesday normal mail, it probably arrived Saturday or today...so I'll go check ASAP.  =)<BR>
<b>Missi:</b>  Eek!  no thanks...got too much on my plate as it is!

<DD><b>Nipsy:</b>  Cool!  Thanks for the PR.  =)  I think I did receive an order from the Clagary area...I'm not sure.  Keep bigging your friends!  lol<BR>
<b>Agatha:</b>  Hehehe...sorry you're excitement-deprived.<BR>
<b>Aurora Star:</b>  Cool!  And you're welcome.<BR>
<b>Blueronin:</b>  Thank you for the escort!<BR>

<DD>Hi back to everybody!!  =)  I am fine, thanks, but awfully busy.  Besides all the typical band-stuff, we're moving in two weeks.  <small>help!</small><BR>
<BR>
<b>LittleWillow:</b>  Well, do your best.  It's a great venue, and I'm SURE you'd have a wonderful time.<BR>
<b>Paris_Angel:</b>  Mail?  Snail mail?  Um, I don't recall.  Was it an order?  When did you send it?  Ack!<BR>
<b>Cirrus:</b>  Well, all I can say is:  your friends are weenies if you can't get even ONE 18 year old to come along for a really cool night on the town, at one of the hottest clubs in LA. ;-)  But keep pluggin' away!  (If you can't make it, fret not.  We'll try and book a Troubadour show soon.  No age limit there.)<BR>
<b>Mike Thomson:</b>  Yes, I've met *almost* the entire cast, (Sarah, Charisma, Aly  , Seth, Nick, David, Anthony...) and quite a lot of the crew.   I sang (lip-synched, whatever) on an episode from the first season called Never Kill A Boy on the First Date.  My band has also performed for the cast at their end-of-season-two wrap party, and at this year's fan patry in L.A., the PBP '99!  (Yay!...I still can't believe I had to sing the whole time while Eliza was dancing to my music, and I never got a chance to meet her.  lol)</SMALL>
