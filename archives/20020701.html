<dd>Hello Bronzers!  My name’s Drew Goddard, I’m the new staff writer on Buffy.  Thought I’d pop in real quick to introduce myself.  So hello!  It’s a true honor to meet you all.  This is a very big moment for me.<br><br>Since Drew Greenberg is here posting as well, to avoid confusion, if you want you can call me a different name.  How about “Steve DeKnight?”<br><br>I’m so excited about all this I can hardly type.<br><br>

<dd>Hallie: the summer was great (it’s over for us writer-types), we’re back at work and into our own private autumn.  Like, I don’t know... Australia or something.  <br><br>Freaking Amazing: I’m good, kinda pumped, we’re hard at work on S7, and I just turned in the first draft of my Firefly ep, so it’s been a pretty busy time.  In a good way.<br><br>Yoshi... smart, smart, Yoshi.  Good, tasteful Yoshi.  Nose wiggles back, and, hey, look over there!  Hmmm?  What pecan pie?  Hey, I just saw this recipe on Sweet Dreams on the Food Network for CHOCOLATE pecan pie.  I was, needless to say, delirious.  Anyone catch that??<br><br>

<dd>Shadow, Nikka, Kestra: Thanks, I’m well, the hiatus was nice, but brief, but I’m happy to be back again with The Gang (we really do run down the street snapping low and dancing, singing, just like a real gang, it’s funny...)<br><br>Molly: Mmmmm.  Hamster cookies.  Wait.  That’s not what you meant...<br><br>Christopher M.: He’s hard to scare, he’s already put up with being trapped in a room for an entire day with Rebecca, Jane and me!!  (And Rebecca’s dog Nina, who guarded the only exit.)<br><br>

<dd>Hello, my sweeties.  I have big news.  Word on the street (and by "street," of course, I mean "my comfy office") is that Young Drew Goddard is going to be dropping by shortly to say a quick howdy.  Be sure to treat him with the same respect and love that you gave me... except, of course, remember that the paddles and the chewing gum were a special treat that were just mine.  Everything else is fair game.  Hope you're all doing well!<br><br>

<dd>Gotta be quick...I'm running out to see a friend of mine's play tonight!  (He wrote and directed it...)<br><br><b>Thoin:</b>  LOL...  I never had stage fright!!  Far from it!  I believe what I said was, I was actually a little nervous, which was surprising 'cause I never get nervous!  ;-)  But yes, any jitters I had are gone.  Thanks!<br><b>tiggy:</b>  Thanks...your weekend sound like more fun, actually!<br><b>OldManFan:</b>  Set length.  We close on July 28th.
