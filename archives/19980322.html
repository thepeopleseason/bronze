<BR>
<b>-mere-</b> - - For the record (do people still say, for the "record"?), I didn't initiate the Anna Nicole Smith line of discussion.  I only jumped right in with a certain gusto.  The fact is that Anna Nicole Smith, in all her cartoonish voluptuousness, is not my type.  I tend to go for the complete opposite.  <b>TV Lori</b> is <b>my</b> ideal.  <BR>
<BR>
And, by that, I don't mean to, in any way imply that TV Lori is, or is not... never mind.<BR>

That's it.  I'm really leaving.  No acronyms, no poems, just the gentle sound of the AOL man telling me, in his pre-recorded voice that I still feel is speaking directly to me, "Goodbye."<BR>

<DD>ok.  so apparently it's been VIP weekend here at the bronze, with the <s>Three Stooges</s> Talented Buffy Triumvirate (<b>Ty, Jeff,</b> and <b>RD</b>) not only making their presence known, but debating the feasibility of having Anna Nicole Smith guest star as a vampiress and chow down on Sunshine.  <small>["i would have to go with stooges, also."]</small><BR>
<BR>
you people need some sleep.  <BR>
<BR>
<b>TVTVTVAlex</b>, you listening?  how about you, <b>Ty</b> "Pink Floyd Rules" <b>King</b>? <b>Jeff</b> "I've Got Random PB'ers Snoring On My Couch" <b>Pruitt</b>? <b>ROANNA</b> "I Can't Have A Cool Middle Nickname Because I Don't Have A Last Name With Which To Sandwich It"? <BR>

remember sleep? that thing that you do when you're not awake?<BR>
<BR>
in any case...<BR>
<BR>
<b>microserf</b>: i humbly bow at your feet for comparing me to betty page--the very reason that the term "hottie" exists.  woo, mama.  plus, i was mucho appreciative of your use of the term "horked", as in "my cats <u>horked</u> up a hairball."  if i'm not mistaken, is that not a Dave Barryism? oh, and videotapes of last night's proceedings would be illegal to transport over state lines.<BR>
<BR>
sorry, <b>Jeff</b>.<BR>
<BR>
<b>TVTVTVAlex</b>: re: IM tweako.  abort, retry, ignore.  abort, retry, ignore. abort, retry, ignore. and skip the retrying part.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Ro</b>: yes, the 12+ hour club for which i still have no cool name. <small>eye suck.</small> but when it's officially formed, you and <b>Ty</b> and <b>TVTVTVAlex</b> will all be charter members.  i hear the perks include nonstop Dewage IV's and a complimentary stylish straitjacket, in any number of assorted pastel colors...<BR>

<BR>
I once worked on a certain show (not Buffy) and when we opened the door to the star's dressing room there he was - putting a roll of socks in.  The next day his "action figure" was hanging from the stage ceiling - with a big sock pinned to it.  The grips put it there as a joke.  The moral is --- never enhance that area.  Go with what ya got.<BR>

<DD>SWMF:  In the days when Ty and I were wide-eyed tykes peeking at the big screen there was a film called, "Freebie & the Bean" starring the number one box office draw - Elliot Gould.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore I submit to you that beans are an integral part of any good hit movie.  Think about how beans have played an important part in your everyday life.  Never underestimate the bean my friend.

<DD>microserf:  Yes.  It's true.  On THE JENNY & SUNSHINE HOUR Sunshine is captured by Anna Nicole Smith and taken to her lair for a BBQ (the kind favored by the un-dead)  Jenny must summon all her old Gypsy comrades to launch a full scale assault on the Smith hide-out located within the deep recesses of the Playboy Mansion.  Finding the half-eaten remains of Sunshine sends Jenny into a rage and she vows to track the escaping Anna Nicole to the ends of the earth.  The show ends with Jenny holding a mighty flaming baseball bat high above her head and crying out, "Think of Sunshine when you look at the night sky.  Sunshine!"  The other Gypsies can only look on as Jenny Calendar begins her deadly quest to find the murderous dog-eater.*<BR>

<b>Boywonder</b> - - To answer your question about who will be the new computer teacher... I haven't seen any episodes past "Lie To Me" yet, since we are a few months behind on the WB station up here in Seattle, so I guess I should ask, why should we even get "new" computer teacher?  I think Jenny Calendar is doing a great job and I'm really starting to like her character.  Besides, I see a future between she and Giles, if she can only get over her upsettedness about this Eygon thing.  So I don't see any need to get a new teacher.  Sunnydale High is too small for two computer teachers anyway.<BR>

<b>LOTHOS</b> - - "Passion" was written under the influence of five days straight of ELP's "Welcome Back My Friends, To The Song That Never Ends" mega live thing.  I started out on Traffic's "Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys", but didn't feel it 'til I moved to Emerson, Lake and Palmer.  That ep just poured out after that.<BR>

<DD>Ty :  I'm typing in Pink now becuase I actually saw Angelyne on the freeway yesterday and almost crashed my car.  Yipe!  Did you ever see her special appearence in that home video rental?  She just danced (sort of) around a chair with a guy sitting in it as the camera sat on a tripod and never blinked.  It was truly horrific.

<b>Jeff AKA Stunt God</b> - - That may be the most brilliant idea I have ever heard.  So, you saw the video of her drunken dance with the bar mitzvah boy (or was it just a birthday party, I forget).  Hey, if you think you could find someone to double for Anna, I would love to write it.  That is one scary woman.  And, if she's not available, Angelyne as a woman with a "picture of Dorian Gray" in her attic would also be good.<BR>
<BR>
Either way, <b>J.P. AKA S.G.</b>, I'm printing that one up and putting it in my dream file.<BR>

<DD>Okay - listen to this Ty ( and don't dismiss this out of hand - just think about it)<BR>
<BR>
Anna Nicole Smith wanders into the library.  She is blotto and she grabs Xander for a dance.  Giles tries to intervene and she vamps out.  She runs amok in the school and the LAPD arrives and surrounds the place ala' DIE HARD.  (The Sunndale Cops dare not question why they are there.)  Buffy (who was in the restroom during all of this) is the only non-hostage and has to outwit the waddling drunkard by placing twinkies in a line that leads Anna out into the open where the LAPD can get a clear shot at her.  The bullets only irritate her.  She runs rampant over the city and she and Buffy wind up in a battle to the finish high above the terrified townspeople at the unfinished Noxen Towers Building.<BR>
<BR>
scarier stuff was never written by a human.

<b>Jeff AKA Stunt God<b> - - To your question, I forget who (sorry), but someone the other day suggested Ewan McGregor, and I think he and James M. could have good times together.  Or... Giles son he wants to forget, who blows into town and hits on Buffy. Still, my favorite answer, so kudos to who first suggested it.

<b>Chrystal</b> - - Anyone who wants my name and reputation can have it.  I've pretty much trashed it to the point no on in his or her right mind would want to be me.  And, I didn't give out the codes, only the names of new colors - there's still a string of symbols and numbers that have to be input first.<BR>

<b>TV Lori</b> - - Now you see the secret of my writing.  Court exhaustion, then befriend it and write with the aid of incoherence.  It lowers you normal standards, and you pretty much just write down everything that comes to mind and think it's pretty darned good.  Oh, except for the script I just sent to Joss.  I know that wasn't good and look forward (sarcasm there) to discussing it on the phone with him today.<BR>

<b>Jeff A.K.A. Stunt God</b> - - The new codes are just new color names used the same old way.  So far, they just seem to be a lot of fun.  In addition to the primary colors and green, they are - - <BR>
<BR>
"shadow" <BR>
<BR>
"aqua" <BR>
<BR>
"indigo" <BR>

The night we packed up and left was the night of my "special foot appearence."  We went back and shot it later though.

<b>Stunt God</b> - - Barnabas and Angelique Collins were the reason I used to run home from school every day.  The actor who played Reverend Trask, Jerry Lacy, is actually a good friend now.  He also played Humphrey Bogart in the Woody Allen movie "Play It Again, Sam" and is married to Julia Duffy, who was on "Newhart" and "Designing Women."  He also wrote an episode of "Parenthood", the series based on the movie that Joss and I wrote for.  I know, more information than you want to know, but Jerry is cool about telling "Dark Shadows" stories.<BR>

<BR>
CharlieS:  Yeah.  Everyone was there.  Except for Sarah (she may have showed up after I left though)  Joss too.  Aly rented a photographer studio in Hollywood and had a couple of bands playing.  It was a cool spot.  It was supposed to be a private place - so I don't know why the police acted as if it were a night club or something.  It wasn't rowdy or anything like that.  Just a bunch of Aly's friends and the guys from work kicking back.

<DD>The party was nice (until the cops showed up and started a problem)  They were out in force and started putting people up against the wall as they were entering and leaving the place we had rented.  They said that they were checking for drugs and underage drinking.  hmmm<BR>
<BR>
The PBer I took home was Jonathan Skinner (who was down in Southern Clif. on some video game business)  I didn't want him to have to ride the bus back to San Diego in the middle of the night - so I let him sleep on the sofa.  He's a nice guy.

<b>Fidelis</b> - - A final word on how determinedly I, at least, avoid research... I am currently adapting a short story of Rudyard Kipling's called "The White Seal" to be an animated feature for Disney.  The character in the story have names like Matkah and Kotick.  In the Disney tradition, I have created a half dozen or so additional characters, mostly comical types, and Disney asked me to do a little research to find names that were authentic for the region of the story (somewhere along the Bering Strait).  Well, three of those characters in the script are named "Karrip" (after a woman, Karen Phillips, who used to post here as "Karriap"), "AkaBeck" (whose name may also be recognizable as derivative of our own "AKA Becker") and "Tel", which was my wife, Michelle's nickname as a child (her sister called her Mattel instead of Michelle... awwww).  Other names, like "Sha'vaka" are purely made up, and "Rupert" the Arctic Owl is named after everyone's favorite watcher.  Disney loves the names a
nd has thanked me for taking the time.  Hee hee, what a stupid Mouse.<BR>
<BR>
<b>TV Lori</b> - - I mean it.  Back off.  Take a nap.  Take a walk.  Compose a poem by rhyming with "microserf."  Get something to eat.  Do sit-ups.  Listen to "Middle of Nowhere", the finely crafted first album by Hanson.  Watch TV.  Run water.  Read a magazine.  Call me here at home and tell me what you're wearing right now.  Anything to take a mind break.  As Frankie Goes to Hollywood once said, "Relax... don't do it."<BR>

<b>bec</b> - - You asked two different questions - "least scariest" and "tackiest".  Two different concepts.  You must define your terms.  But, I really can't play favorites.  Stupidest was the Frankenstein's monster guy, if that helps.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Sparkita</b> - - Temporarily not ignoring you to say, yes, the studios on Radford - formerly MTM where they filmed many great series, from the original Mary Tyler Moore show to St. Elsewhere and Hill Street Blues and Thirtysomething and Mad About You and Seinfeld (for at least a while) and Roseanne and the lagoon scenes in Gilligan's Island and too many others to mention.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Brad Grenz</b> - - You said "Yeah, but how long was Parenthood around?  GP was his first <u>real</u> big gig."  Ouch.  Ouchity ouch ouch.  "Parenthood" was around long enough to appear on 17 of the 20 biggest Television critics "top ten shows on TV" lists, just like "Buffy" was so many years later.  And, believe me, it was a "real big gig"  *Ouch* in the industry.  In fact, when I bumped into Leo about three years ago on the WB lot, he still recognized me from afar (I didn't even see him until I heard a voice call out "Ty!" and he came over to give me a hug) and he said that many producers have told him he first caught their attention in "Parenthood."  So, please don't say that it wasn't a "real big gig".  *Ouch*  Thanks.<BR>

<b>Brad Grenz</b> - - Yes, Leo was on "Growing Pains", but that was after he worked with Joss and I on that series I mentioned earlier (it was called "Parenthood", after the movie), so Leo didn't get his start on "GP".  In fact, Leo used to hang with Joss and me in my office on the lot in Studio City.  We used to open baseball cards together and write on the walls with Markers to kill the time between scenes.  Leo was cool.  Still have old publicity shoot proofs and stuff of a 12 year old Leo in my closet somewhere.  But, the "GP" came a couple of years later.  Just thought I'd clear that up.<BR>

<DD>well, we had Vaultage first, then Kate Kearney's on 50th, where <b>bookish_girl</b> (hereafter known as <b>freakish_girl</b>) and i found ourselves propositioned by several irish frat boys, including one sprawled out on seven kegs at the bottom of the basement stairs. <BR>

we kissed that one.<BR>

<b>Angle Man</b> - - My current gigs (there be three) are just the result of 12 years doing this sort of thing.  My first job was selling a freelance script to a sit-com, probably before you were born, called "Family Ties" (it was Michael J. Fox's series before "Spin City").  So, maybe it answer your question to say I got started by selling a freelance script to a sitcom.<BR>
<BR>
<b>microserf</b> - - Yes, Sanddollar is there because every screenplay contract pre-assigns credits for the possibility of a future TV series, Broadway show, book, etc.  So, it was pre-ordained that Sanddollar would be the production company for any series.  <BR>
<BR>
<b>Whelk</b> - - As for the mulitple Executive Producer titles, this happens.  I was once an Executive Producer on a series with two other Executive Producers, one of whom was Ron Howard, who never once set foot on the set (he was busy in Chicago filming "Backdraft" at the time).  By the way, Joss was a Producer on that series.  The only important thing to know is that the only person who "earned" his Executive Producer title on "Buffy" is Joss.  I have never seen Fran on the lot while I was there.  BTW, David Greenwalt is a Co-Executive Producer, and he <b>definitely</b> earned that title.  I am only excluding the types whose names are there because they were associated with the movie, and for no other reason.  Again, these are my opinions, and do not necessarily reflect those of Joss or anyone else associated with the show.<BR>
<BR>
<b>bec</b> - - Give me a moment to consider.  I know the answer, but am trying to remember whether it falls into the "not to be discussed outside this room" category. <BR>

I would like to vote <b>against</b> making any rules or categories for L.O.S.E.R.s.  I have always been proud of the fact that we are one of the few clubs that don't assign numbers or require application for membership.  We are the club of the common man, anyone can join, and we are all equal in the eyes of the Joss.  <BR>
<BR>
That's just my druthers.  I'll go along with the will of the majority.<BR>

A poem for Malista...<BR>
<BR>
<i>"Samantha, Samantha<BR>
Hold me closer, Tiny Dantha<BR>
I've tried so hard to romantha<BR>
But I have yet to entrantha<BR>
(Much less to de-pantha)<BR>
Perhaps flowers are the antha<BR>
To thaw my cool Samantha."</i><BR>
<BR>
When Ted uses colors, it just cheapens it for the rest of us.<BR>
<BR>
And I <b>can</b> speak on the record about Fran Rubel Kuzui and the Buffy movie.  I read Joss' original draft of "Buffy", the one she bought (and before she got her mitts on it), and to suggest that there was no martial arts or humor is laughable.  The script she bought was brilliant, funny, action filled.  She is like a maniac who takes a sledgehammer to a DaVinci sculpture, smashes it to bits, then says "Look at all the nice little marble pebbles I just made.  Before I got my hands on it, it was just one big hunk of stone."  (I overstate by comparing Joss's script to DaVinci, but you get the idea)  I loved that draft of the script much more than the movie that eventually "de-evolved."<BR>
<BR>
Beyond that, I can't say more.  Joss is invoking Executive Producer Privelege to prevent us from having to talk on this subject.<BR>
