<DD>really leaving now, but ANGLE MAN, nice quote.  At least it's a good read (sigh).  And As for girls in comics, you know the girls I know don't actually stick their butts out like that, or wear tiny torn outfits like that, or have giant prosthetic hooters like that -- comic artists should spring for some live models and stop doing their life drawings from playboy.  (how did I get on this soapbox?  Get me off?  (But I'm right.))<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and yes I still have my evil genius t-shirt, and often grink from my stylish GRR Arrgh mug.<BR>
<BR>
Away must I.

<DD>Whoops, gotta flee.  Thanks again to the committee for the ad (see above re: bitchin'), and try to stay out of trouble.  Remeber, rock and roll is the New Satan, and leads to tasting beer and giving neck rubs out of wedlock.  Peace.

<DD>Okay, more things.  Eliza.  Does she not in fact rock the very world?  Yes.  SPOILERISH COMMENT:  Will she be back?  I will not say, for I cannot.  END SPOILERISH COMMENT.  As to piracy, perhaps you have heard my now infamous comment, "bootleg the puppy".  Got into some hot water with the WB for that one.  Truth is, it was an extremely qualified comment made in the middle of a 20 minute interview.  Can never let your guard down with reporters.  Ever.  Still, I don't mind my rebel image, and it was a pretty frustrating month.  <BR>
<BR>
What is 730?<BR>
<BR>
(chuckles to self, looks out window.  Resumes typing.)<BR>
<BR>
And now a word about Phantom Menace.  GNYAHCK!

<DD><vipgreen>  Okay, couple of things.  Earshot is supposed to air two weeks before the season premiere in sept.  Oddly enough, when we were shooting it I thought it felt like the final highschool ep.  The last three are very personal, but EARSHOT sort of contains the shows thesis statement in a way, so it kind of fits as last ( though I wish it could have aired in order).  As for wolvie's Q aboot the comic, the fact is I never chose anyone to do the comic, I had little to do with it creatively besides saying: can you not pose buffy like she's a porn star like every other comic does, and can you not make the stories too lame?  I too have found the product uneven.  But I thought the Spike and Dru comic looked lovely (mignola disciple much?) and our own writer DOUG PETRIE (comic nut like me) has just written one that I'm anxious to see.

<DD> okay, got the code, got the col<i></i>ors, i'm still me!  Neat.  Very important message:<BR>
<BR>
I FEAR THE GLEMPHY MAN.<BR>
<BR>
So, how's everybody?  I'm shooting Angel ep1 and I'm insanely tired.  Going well, though.  Writing Buffy ep1 at the same time.  Cranky almost always.  Saying hi, though, mostly to deliver my SECRET CODE MESSAGE to the Buffy fans that took out that dare I say bitchin' ad in variety that brought a smile to my lips, a tear to my eye and straing burning sensation to my elbow.  (that last part's not true.)  I guess everyone knows by now that the WB is airing the eps soon.  Thank Dorgrogck the unseeing, I was beginning to worry.
