<BR>
First: you are so correct.  so very correct in your view of societal demands upon the physical standards of women and men and the effect on the individuals self worth. Kudos. <BR>
<BR>
Second: Everyone listen to her she's right.  -mere- indeed is almost always right.<BR>
<BR>
<i> RD squirms through the crowded dance floor to break up the nick-mere-kelly samich, sweat beads on his brow, knots for where his intestines once lived, barefoot and ashamed, he begs -mere- for forgiveness.... and drops to his knee professing his undying, eternal devotion and love for the evil one.</i>

<DD>KittyWillow - not to emphasize the stupidity of your question, but I don't work with those guys.  I'm freelance - I have my own studio where I work, which is a 40 minute (argh) drive from Santa Monica where the Buffy folks are.  I go into the offices for meetings & such but I spend most of my time at my place.<BR>

<SMALL>(Wed Nov 11 15:17:26 1998 209.179.28.173)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>JeffK - I compose at a keyboard.  I have a bunch of samplers and synths that I use to emulate the instruments of an orchestra, which I'm hearing as I compose.  After I'm done I bring in a live player or two or three to sweeten the synth tracks - that makes a big difference, helping the music to "breathe" a lot more.<BR>
<BR>
devil - was the piano music last night the "new" B/A theme - well, I guess you could look at it that way.  The way I see it, it was incidental to the scene and not a major recurring theme.  (Though it does come back, virtually intact, in next week's ep.)   What I consider the "new" B/A theme is the music that was played as Buffy hesitantly approached a chained-up Abgel in B&tB.  The same theme is heard in Band Candy after angel says "Are you being careful?  I worry about you."  The piano music is more of a tai chi thing I guess.<BR>
<BR>
Paris Angel - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
DeMoriel - Erika & I went to different schools.  My improv group (I was the piano player, lest anyone get the impression that I'm actually a comedian) was on tour, visiting Vassar, where we performed with Erika's group.<BR>

<DD>Circe - Am I *not* scoring a film every week?  <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the kind words.  I only get to submit one episode for Emmy consideration.  I agree with you on B&tB so far.  But the Christmas eppy (I have a sneaky sneaky feeling) will soon supplant it as my choice.<BR>
<BR>
As far as last season goes, I would agree with you about Passion except for a weaker-than-usual music cue under the big Angel/Jenny chase through the school.  For some reason, and i can't quite put my finger on it, that one just didn't have the oomph I would have liked it to have.  But the rest of it I'm really proud of.<BR>
<BR>
WILL-O - thanks<BR>
<BR>
? - couldn't find it... (didn't try too hard regardless).  But I'm currently enjoying imagining Willow in a wedding gown...<BR>

<BR>
Corporate Lurker, bronzek8, MeeB - thanks.<BR>
<BR>
melanie - allo<BR>
<BR>
Ali / Briolette - I work on the show after it is finished.  The music is very tightly timed to the visuals, so I need to be sure there won't be picture changes after the music is composed.<BR>
<BR>
KittyWillow - yeah, I guess for my name to show up in blue you have to type the last name.<BR>
<BR>
JeffK - Very interesting.  I've never sees the Karate Kid movies or heard the scores, so I can't say if I agree or not.  But it would be a coincidence.  I would say his comment probably has more to do with the scene as a whole, and not just the music.  And thanks for beating him up.  I hope you got him good.

<DD>bronzek8 - My best idea keeps meeting with rejection.  That is the one about RD (dressed as Pizza Guy) constantly getting run over or Vamp attacked in the back ground during every episode.  It really has nothing to do with any particular story.  I just thought it'd be entertaining to watch week after week.<BR>
<BR>
Gotta run now.  The pager is going off.  Good to see the Bronze again.<BR>

Next week and the following week has some of my favorite action scenes we've done this season in them.  so don't miss those two.  Okay?<BR>

<DD>Fatima - mini-tramp front flip to the stairs.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Joss and I recently talked about that and he agreed with me on it.  So maybe later on I will -  as long as I don't go overboard.  It only makes sense since I'm the only guy with over ten years experience doing that very thing (directing Martial arts action).  The other guys are just learning bit by bit as we go.  When I started they thought that it was impossible to do any more than they had done in the first season.  I showed them a better way.  Now Joss thinks that we can't do any better than what we have on the show at the moment.  I'd like to show him that it can be much, much better than it is.  Not MORE.  Just better quality.  We only scratch the surface at the moment.  I want everything in the show to be the best on TV.   I know we could be better.

Ali - Karen Sheperd is Faith.  Jennifer Bader does Cordy and Dru.  <BR>
<BR>
LadyinBlack - I think David could sit in a chair for an hour and we'd still get good ratings :)<BR>
<BR>
JeffK - Actually Seth's double has a 6 pack of ab muscle going for him.  That was a stunt pad.  The reason you saw it was a wardrobe thing.  We just keep asking for clothes for hiding pads during stunt work.  It is sort of a nessecity if you like to walk afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
MeeB- We always use Sophia for the Buffy action.  That time we just didn't have time to change the angle much.  We also didn't have time to set6 the cameras so that you could see me hit the pavement after I was slammed into the wall.  (*that was me in a wig and fake beard)</SMALL>

<DD>Redthunder - Jane Espenson wrote "Band Candy"<BR>
<BR>
Ali - Nope.  Not on me.  Just Sophia and the boys.<BR>
<BR>
Opus - The final fight was cut all up because the director had Joyce and Giles running throught the fighting shots.  We had to cut around that or else it would have appeared that they ran through over and over (not to mention in different order.)  That's why a lot of the fight is not there that would have been there.  Sorry about that.  You can read about some of it in the next issue of the Buffy Fan Magazine though.<BR>
<BR>
The car hit was also tought to do because the director wanted a loooonnng shot that involved Sophia driving for a hundred yards and then having me ram her just as she popped out into the intersection.  It would have been easier for me to just ram her since I knew it would be cut up in editing anyway.  Still we did it.  Hard to do since I couldn't see her till the last second as she entered the intersection.<BR>
<BR>
Angle - Jack West did the back-flip.  He was also the gymnast in "Anne" who attacked the guys at the grave site.

<DD>hello everyone.<BR>
<BR>
Doc:  Don't worry.  The cop was under the influence of the Band Candy.  I mean,  how many times have you had a cop say to you "will so!" when told that he won't really shoot someone.  That was Gene Hackman's old stunt double from the French Connection.  Perhaps we should have made him whine a bit louder:)<BR>
<BR>
Gryphon - About the Tai-Chi thing:  We just picked out a few moves for David to practice and gave him a tape of Jet Li doing a form.  I knew that he wouldn't have correct form no matter how many hours we put in practicing, but he was supposed to be all off-kilter so I didn't worry about it.<BR>
<BR>
People think Tai Chi is simple because it looks easy, but when you've seen someone good do it you can really see the difference.  We just can't expect an actor to be perfect at Tai Chi anymore than we can expect them to jump up and perform a 540 kick.  It just won't happen.  Or if it does it will look to real Martial artists like... well you know what.<BR>
<BR>
Still - give David some credit.   He was really trying and even I thought he looked sexy ... and I have Sophia at home.  I think they acheived the effect they wanted - if you get my drift.  And I know you do ;/
