<dd>Moriah: I hope to return for a visit <br>to Adelaide in July this year. <br>Sooner if I can GET OFF <br>WORK!!!<br><br>abt: Yes, I work on both Miracles <br>and Angel, so things are busy! <br>Also, when Miracles takes a <br>break, an upcoming new DAFFY <br>DUCK series for Warner Bros <br>Animation ("Duck Dodgers in the <br>23rd and a half Century"). This is <br>why I'm not sure when I can get <br>back to Adelaide!!<br><br>For now, gotta sleep, bye!<br><br>

<dd>Hi Moriah!<br><br>I enjoyed meeting you (again) <br>and talking with you at the PBP. <br>How is your Dad liking <br>Adelaide? (I presume he's liking <br>it!). I reckon he's moved to one of <br>the friendliest places on Earth. <br>'Lord knows I still miss it with all <br>my heart.<br><br>

<dd>faithX5: Great to hear it when <br>viewers liken it to the best of X <br>files (which has happened <br>often). Glad it's not just me that <br>thinks so!<br><br>Adri: Tekillya caught...thanks! <br>Never heard it called that, I'll <br>haffta use that sometime. And <br>hey, as far as this place being a <br>bar, yeah, its a bit like cheers: <br>somewhere I can go where <br>everyone knows my name (well <br>several of people anyway).<br><br>ducky: yeah I think I recall you <br>mentioning that. Good to hear <br>also, as I mostly hear all about <br>how yummy Skeet looks (well, <br>from women at least). Hand of <br>God is dark and creepy, but in <br>different ways from the pilot. It's <br>literally another layer of the <br>onion peeled away: it goes into <br>depths of the story you can't <br>even imagine!! I mean it is <br>simply, utterly SUPERB! (Best <br>viewed after having seen the <br>pilot though: prolly lose a lot <br>impact if you haven't).<br><br>jerrymc: thanks also for yet <br>another X-files compliment!<br><br>remember, the network tinkers <br>with the order, so I can't <br>guarantee next week's IS the ep <br>I am talking about...we'll see.<br><br>

<dd>Thoin:<br><br>If you've only seen the pilot and <br>can only get one other tape, get <br>"Hand of God", which hasn't <br>aired yet. It's really like watching <br>the pilot "part 2"!<br><br>

<dd>miracles fans:<br><br>Please note that although last <br>week I mentioned that THIS <br>week's Miracles episode would <br>continue the story arc of the pilot, <br>the network surprized us by <br>switching the order of the <br>episodes. <br><br>Perhaps next week, but I'm not <br>sure, we'll get the pilot story arc <br>episode. Regardless, the one I <br>am talking about is an episode <br>called "The Hand Of God".<br><br>
