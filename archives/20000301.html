AjO: no, I dumped AOL last year. <BR>
It's actually an Internet <BR>
Explorer problem. I have NEtscape <BR>
and should hop over to it. All <BR>
goes well, I have a little break <BR>
in the schedule, now I can get <BR>
some sleep. (Yeah right, it's <BR>
midnight already!<BR>

In regards to Angel eps airing a <BR>
week later than they are supposed <BR>
to in some Southern Australian <BR>
states: it's only what I heard <BR>
might be happenning from another <BR>
posting board. I don't know the <BR>
official word on that (other than <BR>
it's not a good idea!!).

Lovely Poet, yes I went through <BR>
the previous posts and saw that <BR>
Chris has made his big family <BR>
announcement here. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the compliments on the <BR>
Angel music. I saw fantastic <BR>
comments on Chris' score for this <BR>
week that I haven't heard yet: <BR>
I'll have to borrow a videotape <BR>
from him and check

<DD>Hi lizzie,<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to the Bronze posting <BR>
board! I'm from Australia too, <BR>
but now I live in LA and write <BR>
the music for a show <BR>
called...."Angel".<BR>
<BR>
I noticed on another chat board <BR>
(not the bronze) that someone in <BR>
SA was saying that the <BR>
angel/buffy shows are about to be <BR>
aired out of wack. Seems there <BR>
was the AFL on recently so Angel <BR>
wasnt aired meaning Angel will be <BR>
a week behind Buffy. Not so good <BR>
for crossover episodes. Know <BR>
anything about that? <BR>
<BR>
I hear it MIGHT affect Adelaide <BR>
and Melbourne. Where are you <BR>
from?<BR>
<BR>
Thank

Zipping back from the <s>fake</s> other board.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Nope haqven't seen 17 yet.  Was supposed to start tomorrow but following my favorite credo "why do today what you can put off till next month" it was pushed back a week.<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane - no no no it's the same movie.  Called Bone Daddy here and Palmers Bones in other places, maybe even here sometimes also.  Rutger Hauer as a novelist / former ME tracking a series of grisly murders?  Mmmm good.<BR>
<BR>
Polgara - I don't remember that but I believe you.<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - why oh why must I choose?<BR>
<BR>
elusio - Oh my profile... lucky you.<BR>
<BR>
Uncle Godeater - OK!<BR>
<BR>
thanks Kiera and MeeB (nice meeting you by the way) and Arana and to all of you with the warm baby wishes.<BR>
<BR>
PeaceFire - little Gazoo Destructo Hannigan Beck Jr. is due Oct. 9.<BR>
<BR>
<small>Back to the other board (just to say bye) before my last post here...

Thanks to everyone for the baby congrats.  White Wings, I'll keep you posted.<BR>
<BR>
Haven - it ain't up to me, but it's in the works in the works in the works in the works (might as well type it a few times for good luck) in the works<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Yes, they were originally a little more unslighter (see below).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Starr.<BR>
<BR>
DeM - Canadian, Amaerican, or Euros?  How about "DeMoriel Whedon Wang Beck"?<BR>
<BR>
Jewyl - First indeed.<BR>
<BR>
mesuvius, ye of the many questions - it is rather hard to reuse most cues in Buffy, especially a scene like that which is so specific to the character and what she's doind.  Generic creepy and fighty is easier to reuse (and I do sometimes).  Re: W/O music, you know as much as I do.  But I'm keeping it handy just in case.<BR>
<BR>
Malista - My name is indeed in the credits for Angel although Robert Kral writes the vast majority (almost all in fact) of the scores.  For contractual reasons my name's still there, but by all rights it should be Rob's alone.<BR>
<BR>
Slipping over to kristen's board for a bit.  Back soon.

Is there anywhere else I should be posting?<BR>
<BR>
Peace Fire - The two movies are "Cheer Fever" (starring or own Eliza D and Kirsten Dunst) which is actually 2/3 done, and "Broken Hearts Club" which I'm just starting   (best described as "Swingers with gay guys").  And re: future eps, belive it or not, you all are caught up with me - the most recent ep I've seen is Who Are You.<BR>
<BR>
Nick - Thanks.  To answer your very easy question, "Hush".<BR>
<BR>
Archabgel, iris, Old One, Jewyl, FYG, FASTEDDIE, elusio (s/he of the inflatable sheep), Thoin, Spookymagoo (thanks for the link) - Hi and/or thanks (did I get everyone?)<BR>
<BR>
AjO - (Horshack mode on) oh oh oh - go check out http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/feature_gonzales.shtml.  That goes for anyone else too who may be interested in my brother, Chilly Gonzales.  Yes I said my brother, Chilly Gonzales.  Check out the sound clips from the upcoming album, they were all mixed at my studio here in LA.  To answer your question, the score album is... you guessed it... in the works.<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane - Palmer's Bones AKA Bone Daddy?  Still waiting for the sequel Bone Mommy (my what big femurs you have)<BR>
<BR>
Kasey - breathe<BR>
<BR>
fax - likewise, you have cool (lack of) hair, did I mention that at the PBP?<BR>
<BR>
Godeater - they were a little, well, numerous, but I and many of my friends continue to enjoy them even today.

Kristen - OK.<BR>
<BR>
PeaceFire - Hi back, working on a coupla little movies while on a Buffy break for a coupla weeks<BR>
<BR>
Queen Jenna - There was music during the bathtub (sort of a pretty/sexy/eerie thing) and some more overtly creepy stuff for the mirror.  Joss felt the music was working abit too hard in those scenes, so we kept simplifying and simplifying until we ended up with silence for the bathtub, and a simple low humming thing for the mirror.  I do like what I initially wrote very much but I kinda like the sparseness of it without.<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - Thanks.  The W/T music was mostly just strings.  I slaved over the sampled strings in that scene for half a day before giving up and hiring a violinist to come over and overdub on top of himself 6 times or so, to make a little mini-violin-section.  Made a big difference.<BR>
<BR>
Moriah - Fave cookie = my wife's maternity cookies (oh did I mention she's two months pregnant?)<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius - I'm still involved with the spotting on Angel, and every so often the original "hero/redemption" theme from City Of comes up for discussion.  However, the shows these days don't focus on that aspect of the character as much as they used to, so the opportunities to use it are fewer and farther between.  Loved Rob's score for the Darla ep, BTW.<BR>
<BR>
horizon, slay_me - thanx<BR>
<BR>
Off to try to post on Kristen's board (what's with this registration stuff)...  So give me a few minutes, or see you there, whichever comes first.
