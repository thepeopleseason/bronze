<b>Brad Grenz:</b>  Nope, just a good old fashioned cold.  I think.  I'm super-achey, though, so it could be flu....NO!  It's just a cold.  I'll be over it in a few days...yeah, that's the ticket!<BR>
<BR>
<b>slay_me:</b>   Hmmm....since you were cool enough to put my name in big letters, I'll ignore the fact that you LEFT ME OUT OF YOUR SO LIST!!!    hehehehe  j/k  Things are OK.  A bit slow, so here I am.<BR>

The CD's almost done!!!  It is SO cool, if I do say so myself.

<DD>Thanks for the sympathy, everybody!  (Or is that empathy, since you all are oogy, too?)  Anyway, I'm in day 3 of my evil cold from Hell, and it does nothing but get worse.  Grrrrrr.....  But I WILL be all better by next Saturday.  No worries.  (<b>Asanti,</b>  I am drinking lots of hot tea with the lovely honey whiskey syrup you gave me!  Thanks.)
