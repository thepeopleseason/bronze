<DD>Oh, one last thing...<BR>
<BR>
Somebody please tell DeAn(n) to stop beating that "Fury's favourite girl" thing into the ground.  I don't know how anyone else feels, but I think it's gotten pretty obnoxious.<BR>
<BR>
Just my opinion, Dean.  <BR>
<BR>
Night, peeps.

<DD>Sorry, Geo.  We can't take any unsolicited submissions.  You need an agent to do that.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, bananas, binks.<BR>

Okay, I'm fading fast.  Take heart.  Must fly now...<BR>

<DD>FOr those of you still nervous, even after Joss' posts... Let me reiterate:<BR>
<BR>
We'll be going to the same place, doing the same job, putting the show together exactly as its always been.  Only difference is, it'll be on a different channel.<BR>
<BR>
The good news is... Two more years, at least.  And we'll be add a little more production value when the script calls for it.  <BR>
<BR>
It's a win/win/win thing.  Let the people rejoice.

<DD>THX - No, it won't be the same BUFFY.  <BR>
<BR>
It'll be BUFFY plus lots of money to do the show right.

<DD>Prophet - I'd have thought a visit from the Whedon would have allayed any fears.<BR>
<BR>
Irene - No, I'm here to confirm the crossovers on TLC will be between BUFFY and a documentary about World War I.  I'm not sure how it's gonna work yet, but Joss'll figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Caspian.  To both.  Yay!

<DD>Evening.  Thought I'd stop in after the LA broadcast to see of anyone's heard that BUFFY will next season be inexplicably on The Learning Channel.

<DD>All right, gotta bail in a bailish way.  And don't worry about me doing a nekkid photo shoot -- I don't even like my FACE to be naked in pictures.  See ya

<DD>I can't stay long.  The reason I didn't come on the board last night is that I'm at a family reunion in upstate NY and didn't even KNOW about it.  Then it all fell on my head a few hours ago.<BR>
<BR>
MAXIM: Eliza wasn't naked.  Seen racier photo spreads from other of our girls -- thought Eliza's was kind of restrained for these modern times.  Always strange to see those things, but that seems to be the way of the biz.  And all my girls are beautiful, so what are you gonna do?  No publicity is bad, right?  Right?  Of course, in fairness, David and Nickie and Christian and such should have to do similar shoots, but somehow, don't think it's gonna happen.  Sorry.

<SMALL>(Sat Apr 21 16:41:04 2001 216.238.172.246)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>Okay, a couple of issues:<BR>
<BR>
ANGEL: wwil it move as well?  That depends on the WB, and we honestly won't know what they're gonna do until they do it.  If the they drop it, UPN will put it on as a block with buffy, just like the old days.  If not... well who knows where it'll be.  I just know it'll be cool (we're already working out next year.)<BR>
<BR>
THE WEB SITE:  One of the first things I told the UPN execs about was the site.  I don't know who finances/runs it exactly, but if it's WB based and they pull it, UPN has promised to have a new one up BEFORE that happens.  THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A BRONZE.  Hopefully we can just keep this site up but no matter what, we'll have a home.  <BR>
<BR>
MY SKIN CONDITION:  Getting better.  Really.

<DD>oKAY, SO, APART FROM JUST PRETTY MUCH GIVING THE color CODES AWAY, WHAT'D I DO TODAY? Talked to a bunch of reporters, mostly.   About you know what, so I thought I'd better drop in and talk to you all about it.<BR>
<BR>
We're movin'.<BR>
<BR>
It's all true, we're moving to UPN, and what does this mean for you, the viewer?<BR>
<BR>
WRESTLING!<BR>
<BR>
Well, no, Buffy won't be wrestling.  (Sadly.)  She will be doing exactly the same thing she'd be doing on the WB.  Why we're moving is a long and boring story that you all will no doubt get lots of from the entertainment pres, so I just wanted to let you know this:  NOTHING is going to change except the number on your remote.  We're still making the same eps, hopefully even at the same time.  So if you're panicking, don't.  And if you're not panicking, where's the love?

<DD>To all concerned <BR>
Bronzers, to be honest I'm <BR>
learning it all now thanks to <BR>
YOU guys!!! So right now I <BR>

talk about it at the offices this <BR>
coming week.<BR>
<BR>
I gotta fly (you know *poof* <BR>
and all that), I'm not leaving <BR>
you in the dark, I just don't <BR>
