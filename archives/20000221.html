<DD>I got it!  Just remind - mere - that I owe you lame souveirs and she'll remind me and we'll send 'em!  And NO, wic, you can't have a souvenir just cuz you asked for one, these people EARNED their souvenirs through hard work, memory training and really crappy taste in movies.  (Though it does have moments.  "All that hate's gonna burn you up."  "Keeps me warm."  Plus Harry Dean, gettin' it done.)  YES, the crossover is this year.  No, I have no plans to write a Buffy comic though as meany of you know I am slaving away at a comic about a slayer in the future.<BR>
<BR>
Now (and finally, cuz Kai needs the computer for actual work), a lot of people post that they can't think of an intelligent question to ask when they see me posting.  I thought I'd help out with some questions I think are DAMN INTELLIGENT.  That way, you'll be prepared, and I can look up the answers ahead of time.  Here they are:<BR>
<BR>
1)  Is there something inherently reactionary about horror?  Or is it possible to promote our most civilized ideals while invoking our bas<i></i>est fears?<BR>
<BR>
2) Is Des Cartes second proof, the existence of God, as clearly reasoned as the first?  Is it an appeasement to the church or is it as strongly believed as the existence of self?<BR>
<BR>
3) what's a Des Cartes?<BR>
<BR>
4) Will Buffy and Angel ever get back to gether, but in a gay way like that movie with Perry King?<BR>
<BR>
4)  Where do you get your ideas? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay.  That should help you guys out.  I gotta go, be real.  You're all fascinating and special, except that one guy.<BR>

<DD>Ms Alucard and Angleman both got the answer right!  And apart from publicly admitting to knowing an incredibly cheesy movie much too well, they are superior!  Bow before them.  So.  How exactly do I fulfill the "Lame souvenir" portion of my post?  (note toself:  no AOL after the schnapps.)

<DD>I see people posting that I've gotten too cryptic in my posts, so I'm gonna post some spoilers you'll ALL understand:<BR>
<BR>

Okay, satisfied?  Now I gave away EVERYTHING.  Not true, but I will give away one faily lame souvenier to the person who can tell me what movie those phrases are from in the next five minutes.

<DD>So.  Party.  Have to say, it was a swell time.  Well organized, rockin' and everyone was tirribly tirribly civilized.  I think everyone who works on the show got a huge buzz off it.  So thanks.<BR>
<BR>
floating a rose is NOT a popular phrase for anything in particular.  I am counting on you guys to change that.  (the soft petals and all that, it's not like it never crossed our minds...)  I also have a new phrase coming up in my ep (16) that I hope will make inroads into the american vernacular -- wish me luck!  Actually, i'm fairly excited about my ep.  It was hard to shoot (in a different way than HUSH), but if it works... fun for all of you.<BR>
<BR>
Tara is not evil.  That is not the end of that discussion, however.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, another crossover to come.  But with a very intense change that I can only hint at.  One word:  LEDERHOSEN.  Be there.
