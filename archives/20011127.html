<dd><b>Olivia</b>  Bonjour et merci!  Avez-vous recu quelquechose de Jeff et moi encore???<br><br><b>Old Man Fan:</b>  I know!  I can't leave my house, 'cause people all expect you to speak to them.  (At the store, whatever...)  Very funny.<br><br><b>Princess of Darkness:</b>  Wonderful!  Good luck!<br><br><b>Lilyana:</b>  Yeah, I made my voice much worse because I sang a whole gig before my voice had fully come back.  Very stupid of me.  Oh, well...live and learn, as they say.<br><br>Hi back and thank you's to everyone who said hi or said get well!  (I'm getting a bit overwhelmed!  hehehe)<br><br>

<dd><b>Old Man Fan:</b>  Oh, it's OK.  Not so very Diva-ish lately, (boxes of Kleenex strewn about the apartment, cups and cups and cups of herbal tea with honey, me walking arund in my jammies and ski socks), but hoping to be up to full Diva Power by the weekend.  ;-)<br><b>Kestra Troi:</b>  I would love to visit the PBP again this year!  I hope I get invited...  But regardless, we're going to try and book something that weekend (not conflicting, of course), so those who would like to could come see us play.  =)<br><b>TAMZ:</b>  Heya!  Glad you caught me!  (Glad to be caught???)  ;-)<br>Hi back to <b>hostile 17 & Ivy!</b><br><br>

<dd>Hi back to <b>Winkerbean, Lilyana, & jaiina</b>!  =)<br><br><b>Scourge:</b>  Well, life is always good, but I've been sick for about two weeks now.  I have acute laryngitis and have been told by my doctor not to speak or whisper for a whole week. As a professional singer, you could see where this poses a problem for me.  *sigh*  I've been missing singing gigs left and right.  It's a real bummer.  But hey, things could be way worse.  I'm still a pretty happy gal.  ;-)<br><br><b>Princess of Darkness:</b> You are very welcome!  I hope it was useful in some way.<br><br><b>newt:</b>  LOL!  That's a riot.  Thanks for not holding it against me, though...  ;-)<br><br>
