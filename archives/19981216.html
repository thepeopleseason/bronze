<b>Godeater:</b>  Well, Chris Beck's gone, now, but perhaps we could duel sometime...he could play on leyboards, and then I'd scat-sing the same melody, perhaps???<BR>
<BR>
Well, I've got to go!  Ciao!<BR>

<b>Mabb:</b>  Yes, I did, thanks!  AjO sent me a copy, and then Ripley did, too!  I'm all set.<BR>
<b>Ceridwen:</b>  No problem.  Yes, we sell the CD's for a dollar less if you get them straight from us (check or money order) and avoid the website.  So, that would be $10.95 per CDE plus $1.50 S7H w/in the U.S.  For Canada, it $2.00 s&h.  Here's the addy:<BR>

DeMoriel - Thanks.  The Schindler's List reference was to tie in 19th century Ireland with 20th Century Willow.  Did it work?<BR>
<BR>
Sarah W - Heya!  Yeah, looks like I'm going now, sorry...<BR>
<BR>
Fax1 - I leave it up to you guys.  As figure and head I cannot make that decision.<BR>
<BR>
RyanH - Yeah!  Didn't I email you?  Well, if you didn't get it, I was very impressed.  I commented in my email that it would have made your editing job easier if I always used the same key...<BR>
<BR>
Hey FSM CD Man.  Erika just abbreviated Four Star Mary for me... I could be wrong about my hunch!<BR>
<BR>
Okeydokey, time to go<BR>
Bye all and thanks again<BR>

<DD><b>Chris Beck:</b>  Why thank you, and thank the bass player from FSM for his kind words!  =)  They were great when I saw them, as well.  (It's a mutual admiration society, isn't it?)  How are things going?  Very, very busy, I assume...<BR>

Erika!  Happy belated birthday.  I ran into the bass player from 4 Star Mary who said you guys are great live.  Can't wait to hear you in action at the PBP.<BR>
<BR>
slay_me - I'm finishing up 11 ("Gingerbread").  <i>Anyone looking for spoilers, I'll tell you this: I have no idea why this episode is called "Gingerbread". </i> Then I get a couple of weeks off.  I start work on 12 (which I have not seen, although it's getting lots of good hype) in early Jan.<BR>
<BR>
devil - thanks<BR>
<BR>
raptamama - Cool!  I liked that part too.  Since you didn't ask, the violist was Evan Wilson, principal violist from the LA Phil.  If he wasn't available I would have rescored it for violin.  I love the darker texture of the viola, but the truth is (no disrespect intended) there aren't a helluva lot of great violists out there.  Evan rocks.<BR>
<BR>
Masquerade - Interesting you picked up on the bit of (tried-and-true, or tired-and-true, your pick) tinkly piano there.  I actually had something completely different - more woodwindy and generally happier, but Joss requested an alternate version and I had to come up with one very quickly.  I just went with the first thing that popped into my head.  So that's a long way of saying no, it's not a theme, though it may become one if necessary.<BR>
<BR>
fax1 - I've been doing it for the last couple of times I've posted.  You're the first to notice.<BR>
<BR>
Sachiel - hi.

CD Man - Thanks.  out of curiosity - FSM stands for...?  (I have a hunch)<BR>
<BR>
Avarice, CharlieX - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Fax1 - I admire your persistence in the face of such succinct doomsaying ("No Beck cameo", or something to that effect...)<BR>

Riff Raff & Scout - here, lick my feet, they taste better.

Hiya Bronzers!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks so much to everyone who posted compliments on the score.  I'm particularly proud of it and it's gratifying to see so many of you enjoyed it.  And, on a general note, having watched it on the air on Tuesday (after being away from it for 5 days or so) I must agree with all of you re: Joss = awesome.  He really wrote good.  I tell ya, it's a piece of cake doing my job when he does his job so well.<BR>
<BR>
To the CBCC:<BR>
You guys rock.  You saw, you came, you lobbied, and... unfortunately you were shot down.  Hard.  And that seems to have made you all the more determined.  Which please me to no end.  However, and not being a member myself, I offer this not as a request but as titular-head advice: should we stop now?<BR>
<BR>
Congrats to TC, MeeB, and Cate (I hope I got that right) on the nuptials.<BR>
<BR>
Not much time to stay and chat, gotta go finish ep 11.  (6 minutes to go...)<BR>
- C.
