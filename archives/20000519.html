<DD>Thoin.  You didn't need that kidney.  that's why God gave you two.  *eg*<BR>
<BR>
Anti--She's, what, twenty?  Youth is wasted on the young.<BR>
<BR>
Old One--just a nightcap, thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Luna--hey back.  Hope all's well.<BR>
<BR>
And on that note, I'm off to bed.  Night all.<BR>
<BR>
Be well.

<DD>Megdalen--I'm sure I'll be doing lots of signings this fall.  Just a few this summer, though.<BR>
<BR>
Dru--I actually have written plenty of my own work, and still am doing so.  Check out my website at www.christophergolden.com for more info.<BR>
<BR>
mudpuppy--I can go back to the world of Octavian any time.  It just won't be "the same."  To me, that's good.  I purposely changed the world with each book.  You can't do that with a weekly TV series or certain types of book series, but in a situation like the Shadows books, writing the same thing over and over would have bored me to death.

<DD>Thoin--Spike & Dru is a hardcover.  Great shot of James and Juliet on the cover.<BR>
<BR>
Anti--If it makes you feel any better, I'm not *officially* a VIP.  Never been ordained.  Heh.  And as for the whole ambi-business, I think you and Claris would make a fine couple.  : )

<DD>mudpuppy--sigh, weird, isn't it?  Tons of people have pointed it out, and all I can say in response is 1) great minds think alike and 2) Octavian was first.  heh.<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen--SMOOCHIES!!!  You will be missed in your Honduran exile.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin--scroll down a bit.  All that stuff is in one of my posts.  S&D is October though, and I'm jazzed.  It's a NASTY book.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Brandi, and thanks little dog.<BR>
<BR>
Little Wiggins--I barely have time to come in here, so no, I don't visit the fan sites.

<DD>bufsum--depends on the precise moment.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Little Wiggins--Okay, call me Sir Christopher from now on!  Cool.<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob--how's things?  Just rattled off a bunch of projects.  Ain't that enough?  I'm tired, man.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Anti--Weren't you informed?  The Jell-o Pit is already in, and the tequila came in, but Claris drank it all.  Though she did say she wanted to do body shots OFF you, so maybe you shouldn't always be, um, straight, with friends.  : )

<DD>andyourlittledog--no word on the BoE TV project.  Sigh.  As for Buffy, Monster Book in August, Spike & Dru novel in October, Lost Slayer serialized novel next year, ANGEL monthly comic, and the next five issues of the BUFFY monthly comic, from #21-#25.  For people who've never read the comic, or read it earlier and weren't impressed, I humbly ask you to check out that storyline.  If you like my novels, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane!!!  Not EXCLUDING anyone, of course.  : )  Just SO'ing the people I hear from/talk to regularly.  Yay Canada!!!

<DD>Hey all. Up working late. Thought i'd drop in for a quick hello.  SO's to my Boston Bronzers, actual and honorary, to my bodyguard L'il Willow, and to my adopted Aussies (you know who you are!).
