<DD>Hello!<BR>
<BR>
I just wanted to thank all of you for the wonderful Birthday wishes this past Thursday!!!  You all so completely rock!  Really...thank you to all who posted...it meant a lot to me.  =)<BR>
<BR>
I had a very nice birthday, actually - I was in Palm Springs, enjoying some sun and spa action.  And then I got sick...so I've been out of commission the past few days.  But I'm feeling better now, and I wanted to stop by and say thanks and woo-hoo to all you nice Birthday-wishing folks!
