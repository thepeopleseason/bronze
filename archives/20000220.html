<DD><BR>
okay, really quick, in no order:<BR>
<BR>
I'm from Ames, Iowa.<BR>
<BR>
I like to write in the Beverly Hills Public Library.<BR>
<BR>
I don't think they cut anything out of Earshot... just delayed it a good long time.<BR>
<BR>
Hardest char to write for:  Buffy, because she's so multi-faceted.<BR>
<BR>
And finally, marriage proposals will be considered in the order received.<BR>
<BR>
Bye!

<BR>
Okay, getting ready to go, just wanted to thank everyone for making us all feel so loved and welcomed last night!<BR>
<BR>
TGWIS -- thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Miguel!<BR>
<BR>
AuroraStar -- I think I've heard that song.  Is it... Canadian?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you Sam and Vyger!<BR>
And any courage for taking on guns in school is Joss-courage, not me-courage.  And the lovely scene in the clock tower is his, all his, as much as I wish it was mine.<BR>
<BR>
Michael -- Hi.  Actually next week's ep was written by my pal the beautiful and talented Doug Petrie.  Mine is two after that one.<BR>
<BR>
Hi ClosetBuffyholic -- it was great to meet you last night!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Monique!<BR>
<BR>
Steph -- you asked about eps I wrote in season 4, right?  They are Harsh Light of Day, Pangs, A New Man, Superstar and the Angel ep Rm w/ a Vu.<BR>
<BR>
Okay... here I go.  Bye!

Hi Little Ducky -- don't believe we've met before, nice to meet you.<BR>
<BR>
Dannie, my next ep is called "Superstar."  -- airing in, I guess, three weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Hi WolfGuard and AngelDavid -- thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Hitomi and ShadowSlayer and Hollyn!<BR>
<BR>
Sorry I missed you, Kestrel!<BR>
<BR>
SusieQ -- Hmm.  Women behind the cameras... well, there are a number of them on the set, but I'm not sure what all their jobs are.  I think there's a woman camera operator on our 2nd unit.  And a woman on the painter's crew.  A woman who organizes and directs the extras.  There's are a couple others who seem very powerful indeed -- sort of managing the stage.  I guess I should look into who they all are exactly, huh? -- I'm still a little lost down on the stage, myself, in case you can't tell.

Hi LilBufBuf -- I wrote ep 17 -- and ep 14 aired last week so...  well... I guess we can figure it out from that.  Also, I understand they're reruning Earshot on Wednesday.  Whoo hoo!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Cherice and Steph!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Peace Fire and Tiger -- things are great on the Buffy set.  A little disrupted by the rain the last week or so, but it's all gonna be fine.

Hi Menkhare -- hope you had a good time and that you got to meet everyone you wanted to!  I know the writing staff had a great time so I'm assuming the fans did too.
