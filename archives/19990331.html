<DD>VBF:  hey!  : )<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man:  Grrr.  tell me about it.  I spotted it right off, and was a little peeved.<BR>
<BR>
Sara the Brown:  Thanks!  *blush*  I hope nobody's disappointed in the finale of Gatekeeper.  The Spike & Dru comic should be out in three weeks, and my friend Tom Sniegoski and I just finished writing the script for teh Buffy annual comic, which is very lighthearted and fun.

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
keylime - ah the wonders of time-delayed bronzing... see my post below re: oreo cereal.<BR>
<BR>
Jasmen - sure we can try a dinner sometime... you know the e addy.<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - indeed it was.  Yes it was recorded.  It was comissioned by a philanthropist over in Taiwan as a "vanity project" - he had a small number of CD's made and distributed them to members of his foundation.  He just asked Jane/wife for another - we're currently plannning a March 2000 recording session.  yeah, she's a composer too, though primarily a songwriter.  She's over in Taiwan right now prmoting her first major-label CD for an established singer.  Two days ago she played piano for a live performance of one of the songs on a national talk show.  Cool huh?<BR>
<BR>
OK, with all the talk of Cinnamon Toast Crunch I think i should try it.  I always thought of it as an adult cereal with cinnamon flavoring, like cinammon shredded wheat, and that turned me off.  But now I think it's next on my list. <BR>
<BR>
In case anyone cares until my senior year in college I *hated* milk in my cereal.<BR>

Jean Quidam - There is indeed an E flat dminished ninth.  Why anyone would want to use it I don't know. <BR>
<BR>
slay_me - I wouldn't have picked "Gingerbread" as the one to make your Mom listen to, but still - cool.<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob - Capn Crunch is a recurring fave.  I hate it when it's mistakenly called "Captain Crunch".  It's CAP'N people!<BR>
<BR>
greengirl - HA!  at this very moment I have a box of Oreo cookie cereal, half-full, in my studio, getting staler by the day.  It's probably been there a month.  I should just toss it, it can't be any good, and I'm certainly not willing to taste it... any volunteers?<BR>
<BR>
Anais - I've never seen "The Sweet Hereafter" but I really dig the CD.  Trivia tidbit - Sarah Polley, young rising "it" girl of the moment, sung a bunch of songs on that soundtrack.  She also sang (wordless) vocals on the score to "Guinevere", which she was in, and which I composed at the end of last year.<BR>
<BR>
Fatima - I'm glad you told me that - that's quite a compliment.  I only try to do my job, which is service the picture... if music comes out of it that's actually listenable on its own then that's extracool.

Hiyas to LB, MeeB, Xander43, Sgt Schultz, Jasmen, Bruces Mom, Jeanie TTF, Gryphon<BR>
<BR>
Corvus - I conducted a 70-piece orchestra for two days in May of last year, playing music of my wife's.<BR>
<BR>
Lab - Yeah, I have the package... things are a bit screwy cuz they keep pushing back the spotting for "Choices".  How much time have I got?<BR>
<BR>
Keylime - I'll take some them poptarts.<BR>
<BR>
Wild Weasel - Curlysue thanks you, and hi to the both of you.<BR>
<BR>
Digital Grand - what's your name about?<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob, devil (& fax) - Just finished "Earshot", waiting for TPTB to finish cutting "Choices" so I can get <s>procrastinating</s> cracking.<BR>
<BR>
Missi - in Earshot, Buffy must deal with the loss of her powers when Giles injects a mysterious enzyme into her ear (I can probably do better but oh so lazy)<BR>
<BR>
Slayinvamps - good for you, keep at it til you have them all, then I'll give you a special cookie.

(oops, server probs, sorry)<BR>
<BR>
DingoBaby - yeah it's actually afternoon here (which I realized, much to my chagrin, after I posted my "good morning" message).  Oh well, if I say it feels like morning is that an excuse?<BR>
<BR>
RSO contessa beth, Shadowslayer, Cate, Whirlwind, Labrynth<BR>
<BR>
Liddie - I actually have a bit of a kiddie cereal fixation that continues to this day.  I sort of go overboard on a particular cereal until I get tired of it and then move on to the next one.  Right now it's Cocoa Krispies.  I have three boxes in my kitchen.  Next I think I'll go with Lucky Charms.<BR>
<BR>
(You might call me a cereal monogamist)<BR>
<BR>
(I swear I didn't just make that up for the sake of the joke)<BR>
<BR>
Missi - the site is awesome.

No spoilers for you Vaedus.  Bad boy.<BR>
