<DD>  Alright, my loverlies, i'm gonna go take care of my yowling doggie.  She's pretty mad at me for not paying her any attention.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for listening and watching and caring.  What you say on the board does affect the cast and crew of Buffy land.  <BR>
<BR>
love and goodnight!

<DD>  The guy singing with Andy was his friend jamie.  And the hottie next to HIM was Madame Kai(who rocks)!  But you guys already knew that.  <BR>
<BR>
Tonight's ep is amazing.  I hope you guys enjoy it.  The next one's even better.  Tara gets to make out with Spike and Oz!

<DD>  Okay, I'm only gonna metion the movie thing once.  That way I can clear up all weirdness, confusion, etc, etc.  I am making a movie and am super excited about the whole thing.  It's something I wrote and am gonna direct and act in.  Am I insane???  ANyway,  i felt weird asking for help (I'm footing the whole budget myself), but then I realized that I would help someone out, so...  I guess, i just hate asking for anything in this world. I'd rather give ya know.  But anyway, I'm not asking for donations. I'm selling pics from the movie set which will in turn help me recoup costs and pay for food, expendables, etc. That, or else I'm gonna go sell the old bod down at Hollywood andVine J/K  Somehow I think I'd get laughed off the street corner.

<DD>Thoin, Kai sez that's real real sweet, what you posted about her and yes, she does radiate joy, which is why it's fun to be married to her.  I have to go but I'll come back later and hunt down pic links.  Thanks to everyone who put 'em up.  <BR>
<BR>
Until the next WACKY COMEDY EPISODE....<BR>

<DD>  Hey Angel Rachel and Yummy! You guys bowl ME over.  No more not liking Dawn talk.  Michelle is an angel.  Just a sweetie love.  You guys (who haven't had the pleasure of meeting her) would LOVE her.  Seriously.  She's like my little sis.  <BR>
<BR>
I just want to say that life is entirely too short.  Carpe Diem is the word.  You gotta do what's in your heart.  You gotta live your dreams.  And because of Buffy and all the cool stuff that's happened since I started on the show - I'm able to do what I love.  I get to act and write comics and hang out with super cool people...  And make movies.   (I am beside myself with joy)  You guys understand...  I'm living in that *two minutes before a new Buffy ep is about to come on* world.  Cloud nine

<DD>Romeo, I wrote a song today but Andy didn't come over so I don't know if it's right for him at all.  But you'll hear it, and if it's wrong, I'll write another.

<DD>  I've been wearing my kitten t-shirt for three days straight!!  And on the whole kissing issue, let me just say that Alyson Hannigan is *quite* the lady!!  I must have kissed her about 400 times.<BR>
<BR>
The comic book is coming out in April, probably.  I think it's going to be really cool.  <BR>
<BR>
And, yes, Thom Yorke, regardless of what anyone else thinks, is a Sex God.  *g*

<DD><blue1296>  Okay, so can I just say that everyone I met at the PBP was soooooooo amazing.  You guys touch me.  you really do.  I never realized how special and important just getting to "know" you guys was gonna be.  And I hadn't had such a good cry (The Body excepted) in quite awhile.  TAK4Ever and Extra Flamey, you guys are something else :)
