<dd>OK, I just <i>have</i> to go to bed, now...<br><br><b>sunlit5:</b>  Hey, thanks.  Just go to "music" and click on an album, and it'll give you clips of the songs.  Or just click on "free MP3's" on the right hand side of our home page.<br><br>

<dd><b>1cham:</b>  Well, that's wonderful, but unfortunately we don't sell any VC CD's in stores anymore.  (Not right now, at least.)  We do sell them online, from our very own secure website, <a href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank">www.velvetchain.com</a>  =)<br><br><b>valMichael:</b>  Yep!  We'll have everything there except "Warm," which is currently out of print.  So, there should be at least 4 or 5 different albums to choose from.  =)<br><br><b></b><br><br>

<dd><b>valMichael:</b> Both, actually.  Our recording process is hard to describe...  It varies from song to song.  But usually, we all record "live" in the room together (with me in the control room singing, so I don't bleed through onto the guitar tracks or whatever), and then we overdub the vocals and all the cool wacky sounds and extra instruments we use.  Jeff spends a lot of time in the studio manipulating all the extra sonic elements.  It's cool.  =)<br><br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Cool!  See you then!<br><br><b>Bear:</b>  Well, hello!  Nice to meet you!<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>tiggy!</b><br><b>faithx5</b>  Oh, cool!  Well, if you remember the play at all, I'm playing Yvonne, the very snooty wife of the other (rich) artist, Jules.  They're always criticizing George's work, etc.  It's a fun role.  I've been doing a lot of musicals over the past year as a way to make my living, actually.  Out here in LA, it's impossible to get paid for doing theater unless you do a musical.  I figure it's a heck of a lot better than what I used to do to help pay the rent...work at Bloomingdale's!  Blech!<br><br>

<dd><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Hey!  Yes, Jeff will be running a merchandise table again, and not only will we have the Instrumentals Only CD, but I wanted to let everybody know that we're going to have a <b>special CD</b> for sale at the PBP!  It's a pre-release demo of a bunch of the songs from the upcoming Asteroid Belt!  Cool, eh?  I think it ended up being 6 songs.  We're only making 100 of them, total.  That's it.  No more.  It's unmastered, and all the vocals are completely dry (meaning, no effects, reverb, etc.), but it's extremely cool and sounds great.  =)  Just thought I'd let you know!<br><br><b>faithx5:</b>  hehehe...  Cool!  Yep, I'm rehearsing for a musical called "Sunday in the Park with George."  It's going quite well.<br><br>

We don't very much rain here, either, but the past couple of days have been pretty torrential.  We needed it, though...<br><br>
