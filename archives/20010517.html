<DD>OK, I better go get ready for the <i>"I'm Not On Win Ben Stein's Money Tonight, But I Swear I Will Be"</i> party!  lol  Thanks for all the moral support folks...<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and if it still doesn't sir tomorrow night, I'll come back and tell you how I did.  I've been keeping it a secret til the show aired, but now, who knows?  hehehe<BR>
<BR>
OK, Bye!<BR>

<DD>You guys are all so sweet...  Thank you very much for making me feel better.  IT's just so <i>frustrating</i> not to be able to find out when it's airing!  (See, I had a feeling this might happen, so I tried to verify the date and time on my own, but to no avail.  I couldn't get an answer from anyone at the show, or at Comedy Central, or anywhere.  *sigh*)  But you're right!   We''l just have a nice party and maybe watch the <i>Friends</i> wedding instead!  LOL<BR>
<BR>
Someone <i>please</i> let me know if you see it tomorrow night - or any night, OK?<BR>
<BR>

<DD>OK, here's the latest theory...<BR>
<BR>
I may be on Win Ben Stein's Money <i>tomorrow</i> night.  See, the schedule over at comedycentral.com said that the big 500th episode special was going to air tomorrow, May 18th.  Well, that episode aired this past Monday, the 14th, instead.  Maybe that threw everything off by one day...that's my guess.  I hope.  'Cause you know, I'm very annoyed.  And I don't get any prize money I might have won until <i>after</i> the Joss-darn episode airs.  So it better air soon!  *sigh*  (And I have to work late tomorrow night, so I won't see it anyway...)

<DD>Oh, noooooooooooo....<BR>
<BR>
I am so upset.  So very upset.  I <i>knew</i> this would happen.  I'm <i>not</i> on tonight.  My Mom just called to let me know.  This so sucks.  The Comedy Central bozos screwed up.  They told me over at the show that this might happen.  I'm so so so upset.  I'm having a party, and I won't be on TV.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH.  Help!<BR>

<BR>
<b>Watch me kick some butt on <i>Win Ben Stein's Money</i> today, May 17th at 7:30pm both Eastern and Pacific time on Comedy Central!!</b>  =)<BR>
<BR>
I guess that means I'll be coming on the old tube in about 20 minutes on the East coast...<BR>
<BR>
Woo-hoo!<BR>

Okay, one more...<BR>
<BR>
Yes!  We are working on next year already... just figuring out what's going to happen.  Fun stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Christina, is it?  Who asked about how I got into writing -- the short answer is that I watched a lot of TV and then wrote sample scripts that I sent in to Star Trek: Next Generation.  So... all you kids out there!  Watch TV!  It's good for you!  I promise!<BR>
<BR>
I have to go... but thanks for everything -- we're so glad to have you guys and we know you'll follow us into the UPN of it!  Thanks for that so much!<BR>

<DD><BR>
Hmm.  People have asked about Riley, Amy, Numfar and Jonathan.  One of these four will be around.  Which one?  Oh gosh, I dropped something... oof... what was the question?<BR>
<BR>
Actually I'm feeling dangerously close to just spilling all the secrets!  I better go!<BR>

<DD><BR>
<BR>
Hmm.  GF asks about the kiss Buffy gave Spike at the end of "Intervention" -- it was certainly gratitude and forgiveness...  Yep, certainly those things all right.<BR>
<BR>
Wow.  I didn't know that so many people were aware of the Succubus radio "appearance" -- I'll try to dress pretty and answer correctly!<BR>

Dinky, Hi! -- Yeah, my understanding is that the UPN contracted for two seasons, that is 44 eps of Buffy guaranteed... which is nice.<BR>
<BR>
DeAn -- Uh-oh.  I'm not so good on the Buffy quizzes... I get episode titles all mixed up.  Oh well.<BR>
<BR>
Narrator -- Yeah, I just finished a Buffy animated script -- big fun for little Buffy (not the real title).  <BR>
<BR>
And thanks for the Latin West Wing translation, those who provided it -- I wanted that.<BR>

All hail mighty Zeus!  Life is pretty darn cool.  I'm having fun with the other writers, dreaming up notions and such for next year!<BR>

Hi.  I haven't been here for awhile, maybe no one remembers me.  Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and make sure everyone is appropriately grooving with the end-of-season juggernaut of eps!<BR>
