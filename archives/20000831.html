<DD><b>Lord Mysty Mage & Matt the Bruins Fan:</b>  Hehehe...Well, yeah, I guess my butt has been in less auspicious places.  hehehehe  The story is pretty simple:  I went to "The Why," a play at the Hudson Theater here in LA, with <b>dog, DreamLurker, and LW.</b>  Noah Wyle produced the play (which was excellent, and featured the fabulous James Marsters), and has recently stepped in to the lead role.  He kicked @$$!  He was very impressive, and I went up to him to tell him how amazing he was, and <b>dog</b> snapped a photo - without my knowledge - of my backside as I was talking to him.  =)
