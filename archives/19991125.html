<DD>OOps.  I just saw that Little Willow was asking about her cameo.  I don't want to leave her hanging.  I better answer that one before I go.<BR>
<BR>
Little Willow - It's just that (and I'm sure Joss won't mind me saying this one thing about a future ep.) during episode 12 one character calls Willow "Little Willow."  It's even spelled with a capital L too.  I thought that was cute.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't mean to freak you out there LW.<BR>
<BR>
Okay,  have a great holiday everybody and thanks for talking to me (even though I know you are all only part of the MATRIX)<BR>

<DD>menk - Yes, Sophia speaks  Cantonese.  I only know stunt phrases to communicate with the guys.<BR>
<BR>
lurking b - I don't know if she worked for them.  She made around 45 films there.

<DD>Blueronin - Okay funny story about that Spike thing.  I thought he was only supposed to not be able to BITE people.  I didn't think that he couldn't FIGHT people.  So the fight I made was actually more severe than what is shown in that episode.  It had to be edited down to make it as non-violent as possible.  <BR>
<BR>
James was reading his lines for the "Pangs" episode where he says, "I can't even hit anyone."  He turned to me and said , "Uh, Jeff what does this mean here?"  I went, "Uh... oops."  So we decided that he would gradually come under the full influence of the chip to curb his violence.  Now he can't hit anyone.  I sheepishly mentioned a possible 'it was all a dream' show scene ala' DALLAS, but that was shot down.  So the implant gradually became effective.  Okay?!!?<BR>

<DD>lurking b - Sophia was trained in HK and worked there during the golden years of '86-93 when all the really cool movies were done.  I used to watch her HK movies and she used to see my American movies.  She wanted to meet the American guy who was the only one doing HK st<i></i>yle when she first moved here and that's how we met.  The Asian guys I worked with all moved here and we lived together under one roof for years.  The living room was a minefield of ash trays (if you know how those guys smoke you'll know what I mean)

<DD>Acid Cross - Don't do like I did (to quote Dr. Dre)  At least wear pants.  My forgetting to cloth the lower half has cost me many job opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
Sita - Everybody goes through a different door.  It's sorta like the Circus.  You have to get training and hook up with the right people.  Everyone has a background in something (gymnastics, Martial arts, motocross, cars, high diving)  Then we learn to put the physical skills to use in a different way by adding the stunt skills to our other skills.  Then a coordinator has to take a chance on hiring you after you've gotten the SAG card.  It usually takes a some years to do all of this.  But then there is no assurance of continued employment.  It's a crap shoot.  There are less than 1700 pro stunt people and only 200 of us make a good living at it.  That lucky 200 takes almost all the jobs.  That's why we all know of each other.  It's a tiny town.

DeMorial - But were those naked guys running through your dorm carrying stun guns?  Stevenson Hall freaks me.<BR>
<BR>
Wicked Wicca - Don't worry.  You haven't seen typos till you've seen me rant.  How can people understand me sometimes?  Maybe they just humor me.  Maybe you are all part of the MATRIX and I'm only talking to a machine...<BR>

<DD>Sita: each show's Casting Director sends out "breakdowns" listing the parts and giving a brief description of the type of character.  Agents recieve this info via a service and they will send in pics and resume's of any actor they feel might be right for the part.

<DD>Zeus:  The movie was "Double Dragons" and the young actor I doubled was Scott Wolf.  Now THAT was a lame movie.  Expensive too.  One day on that cost as much as Guyver 2 did.  Yet I enjoyed Guyver much more.<BR>
<BR>
lurking b - So maybe you'll see my buddy Chad Stahelski and Yuen Woo Ping down there where you are.  I'll bet he comes back with an accent.  hehe  Sophia's sisters already think she sounds American on the phone now.  She doesn't to us though.
