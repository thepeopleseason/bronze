<DD> Yes - it is very loiud (as I predicted) but a great time. My hair is White!, and I feel like I'm wearing a bald cap a little too tight - but the effect works, I think, thanks for asking.

<DD> Halloween: Woochie company is marketing vamp make-ups for Halloween; Contact Cinema secrets in Toluca Lake Ca. <BR>
Eyes: the vamp eyes are contact lenses, not computer. Even the glowing eyes from the roomate episode were blacklight activated contacts.

<DD> The Adam make-up is in several sections, but the body is a full suit which the neck is glued to (at the brestbone) then blenders are glued over the edges to hide all the joins. Really, the Adam make-up is not very different from the Anthony make-up for New Man. About 5 hours. and a similar process.

<DD> LCJ: All the prosthetics are made by optic Nerve. My job is to take the pieces and apply them. As for the design of the vamps (I forget who asked) it was loosely bas<i></i>ed on Lost Boys as per instructions from Joss to the Burmans.

<DD> You know who told me about the sweet and low? - James Marsters, of course! Thanks for the tip. <BR>
Tara: The longest make-up seems to be Adam. We just can't seem to get it below 5 or 6 hours. It is very complicated and a real challenge. (Don't be shy - we love questions about our work).<BR>
Slayer: try used book stores, I have a recent edition, I can't believe it is out of print. Amazon.com?

<DD> So many questions and I am bleaching my hair for tonight - it stings!<BR>
I was hired by a make-up effects house "Burman Studios" to run the make-up department of the presentation of Buffy (that's like 1/2 a pilot). Later, when the show went to series I was retained as dept head, but the effects house changed to Optic Nerve. You will see their credit with mine at the end of the roll.<BR>
I became a make-up artist many years ago as a fan of the tv show Dark Shadows, I began work in a little tv studio at 17 and moved to films soon after. By 25 I was chairman of the make-up dept of the union in Vancouver. At 30 I moved to Los Angeles ( I was born here) and have been here ever since. That help?

<DD> I hate the small keyboard - excuse the typo-s. I appreciate your thoughts, Joe, but all those complaints should be addressed to the people who work in those areas. I can deal with anything to do with the make-up -little else falls into my area. I wouldn't even know who to talk to. And as far as the lighting - the show's Director of Photography is one step below the director - not someone you "tell" how to do things!

<DD> Sorry guys, my posts aren't comming bthruogh. Yell I'll be there, I expect Anthony, Alyson, Alexis, for sure. Jeff and Sophia of course. A slew of make-up people: David De Leon and Dayne Johnson from Angel, Robin Beauchesne, my second, and some other srew,<BR>
Joe: You flatter me to think a lowly crew member could tell out irector of photography how to do his job! And yes, I did the willow-vamp make-up
