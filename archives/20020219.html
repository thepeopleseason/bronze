<dd>BlueBoy,<br><br>Slight spoiler<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>I didn't see the broadcast of the <br>Eppy. Sorry to hear the score <br>sounded too loud in the comedy <br>sections. I'm not at the mix, and <br>I feel they usually do a great job. <br>Sure wasn't my intention for that <br>score to be loud at all.<br>3<br>2<br>1<br><br>On a completely different note:<br><br>WOW Just saw Alisa Camplin <br>(not sure on the spelling) take <br>GOLD for women's Aerial Skiing <br>at the winter Olympics. Brought <br>tears to my eyes. How fantastic!! <br>2 Golds for Australia and history <br>is made. (For us anyway!!)<br><br>Loved how her parents weren't <br>to be there as she didn't want <br>the pressure of having them in <br>the audience. They flew over in <br>secret and hid behind an Aussie <br>flag in the crowd. Then greeted <br>her after it was announced she'd <br>won Gold.<br><br>Purely excellent stuff. VERY <br>inspiring.<br><br>:)<br><br>(PS to posters overseas: If <br>you're wondering why I'm a little <br>late on this news its because <br>here in the USA we DON'T get <br>the Olympics LIVE, even though <br>it's happening in this country!)<br>.....<br><br>
