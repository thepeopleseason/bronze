<dd>Okay all, here is the big post.  For all of <br>you who live in Sounthern California <br>and would like to come out and see <br>some great theatre - here is some info <br>on a play I am doing in Pasadena for <br>the next two weekends.<br><br>FURIOUS THEATRES' <br>(www.furioustheatre.org) WEST <br>COAST PREMIERE OF<br><br>MOJO by Jez Butterworth<br><br>Act 1, Scene 1.<br><br>London.  1958.  The dawn of Rock 'n <br>Roll.  Upstairs at The Atlantic.  We hear <br>the DRUMS and the THUDDING <br>BASS.  The music rises, faster, louder.  <br>SILVER JOHNNY stands alone.  The <br>girls scream, but he keeps them <br>wating...<br><br>February 21 - March 23, 2003 <br>Friday - Sunday 8:30 pm<br>Tickets $15-$20 <br>965 N. Fair Oaks Ave. Pasadena CA <br>91103<br><br>Come and see what London's Evening <br>Standard called "a jet-black comedy, <br>which arouses shudders of <br>amusement and laughter" and what <br>the Chicago Tribune called "raucous, <br>flamboyant, high-energy".<br><br>About Furious Theatre:<br>"A group that deserves watching" - Los <br>Angeles Times<br>"Best New Theatre Company" - <br>Pasadena Weekly<br>"Best Debut" - Back Stage West <br>Special Garland Award 2002<br><br>for tickets call (818) 679-8854 or visit <br>www.furioustheatre.org<br><br>Would love to see any and all who can <br>make it out to the show, but be warned <br>it is definetely R-Rated with tons of four <br>letter words and just a bit of the Ultra-<br>Violence.  Good times for all.  If you <br>can come make sure to stick around <br>after the show - I love meeting any and <br>all Clem fans!!<br><br>Thanks alot everyone.<br><br>James Leary<br>"Clem"<br><br>

<dd>Holy Cow!!  Feeling the love.  Sorry it <br>seemed like I bailed on everyone after <br>that first post.  Still figureing out how all <br>this works.  Stepped away from the <br>computer for a while and ... WOW!<br><br>Just to answer a few of the questions <br>that I saw as I was scrolling down the <br>page.<br><br>1.  I love playing Clem.  BtVS was one <br>of my favorite shows and on the top of <br>my list of shows to try and get on when <br>I moved to LA - so it's been a great <br>ride.<br><br>2.  Beding in OMWF would have been <br>fantastic, but I can't carry a tune in a <br>bucket  very tone deaf-- Joss must be <br>psychic.<br><br>Okay that's all for now I think.  We be <br>back soon for some shameless actor <br>self promotion for all of you Buffy fans <br>who live in Southern California.<br><br>Thanks again for all the support.<br><br>James Leary<br><br>"Clem"<br><br>
