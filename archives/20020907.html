<dd><b>Red Crayon:</b>  OK, this might be shorter than what I typed and lost.  Sorry!  ;-)  We lip-synched to ourselves, but it was really hard, because what they did was, they'd start the song, let it play for maybe 5 or 10 seconds, so everyone could start dancing, then turn it off!  So, we were all lip-synching and mime-playing to nothing!  I was amazed it came out as well as it did.  They did that so that the dialogue wouldn't have any background noise in it.  A nice, clean, dialogue track.  Then they added in the song later.  SMG was almost a foot shorter than that guy, but I don't remember her standing on a box.  I think he just was bending at the knees.  The dress was mine, as was my whole outfit.  The costume designer and I had very similar taste, so after she looked at what I'd brought (I brought about 4 different outfits) and what she'd had in mind, she chose the dress I I'd brought from home.  The shoot took about 12 hours.  It was a lot of fun!<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Hey!  Thanks!<br><br><b>The Black Sparrow:</b>  Thanks for not hating me!  And good luck!<br><br><b>Nikka'</b>  yeah, I know!  Let's just enjoy the slower pace while it lasts, right?  ;-)<br><br>
