Anti and/or Huntress  knows way too much about me if they know I'm a huge sloppy Barry fan -- I'll assure it was a lucky guess.<BR>
<BR>
Carlycat -- I loved that "interrupting" moment too -- it was a Joss pitch... one of his first notions about the ep, actually.<BR>
<BR>
Okay... bye now!

Okay... getting ready to go.<BR>
<BR>
To buffythe...  I like to write in the library... people, but quiet people... they're the best.<BR>
<BR>
dru: tuna and saurkraut on toast (really).<BR>
<BR>
Lady Wolfsbane -- good call.  A New Man ran VERY long and lot of my faves got cut.  (Ethan's drunken rant against synthetic slug's heads).  <BR>
<BR>
Okay... taking off now (unless I read a new Q that I must answer).

David Mello -- okay, pencilling that into my planner for five years from now... "reconcile Buffy and Angel"   (hee hee)<BR>
<BR>
A more elaborate greeting to Eluded.<BR>
<BR>
To Oh, Brother... I once heard Tony comment on Angel's tattoo... he said that God reached down and put it there so everyone would know what letter Angel started with.  I found that very amusing.

April -- I only wrote that one Angel (Rm)... in season 4 of Buffy I did Harsh Light, Pangs, New Man and Superstar.<BR>
<BR>
Polgara...don't be shy!  It's yucky being a VIP at the PBP when people don't talk to you... help me out and come over!<BR>
<BR>
Slave2Faith:  I never took a TV writing course... just one lame playwriting course.  You don't need that... just experience enjoying TV... you'll find you've already absorbed most of what you need to know.<BR>
<BR>
I like DarkLady... she praises me the best.

dru -- well, okay... a nice bowl of Ramen.<BR>
<BR>
Oh brother... I think he got the tattoo after he was a vampire.  Remember in... I think it was ep 6 of Angel, when he's being tortured and the guy comments on how little skin damage he's incurred over the years... I think Vampire skin heals quickly, but can be affected.<BR>
<BR>
Nice to meet you Eluded!<BR>
<BR>
KiM -- thanks for making it easier... that's one tough name.

I should make clear that it's not an open door to come in and pitch to Joss... you have to have good specs submitted though an agent, and he has to really like what he sees, and then there's a preliminary interview before you even get to him.

Slave2Faith -- you should definitely try TV writing... you've said a number of insightful things on the board and I think you'd be good.  I got the job with a combo of "spec" scripts (NYPD Blue and Ellen) -- and then you come in and meet Joss and pitch Buffy ideas.  The first step though is writing a good spec.  No trick to it... just good writin'!

Hi LilBufBuf, Puppiecat... thank you!<BR>
<BR>
KiMnUs -- you're right... Buffy should be kinda upset about that Faith/Riley thing... I would be.  Good point.<BR>
<BR>
Lady of Buffdom -- yes!  Nametags with our names on them at PBP 2001!  Someone get on that right now!<BR>
<BR>
Hi dru, Huntress...<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady -- Dunno why the ep got moved up... maybe it's so good America demanded it.

Hi PlainDave  I don't think Eliza got a huge amount of notice... a few weeks if I recall... I'm sure there was some concern about if her schedule would allow it, but it did.  Re Alison Eastwood... maybe... but since I don't know who that is, I guess I didn't hear about it.<BR>

Hi LilTree<BR>

Hi KiMNus (don't think I got that quite right) -- what a great compliment... glad you like my eps!

Hi SlayerGrl ... my goodness yes, we're producing as fast as we can.  Actually it's been pretty frantic.  22 hours of TV is a lot to put together... and 44 if you count Angel!

<BR>
sb6 - Yeah it was me (with Joey Altruda) who did "Thick as Thieves".  No CD now or probably ever, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Fox is currently in talks with a record company to make a score album.  That kind of puts things on hold for now with the MP3's.  And it's completely not my thing but that Randy Newman/Sarah McL song was very nice.<BR>
<BR>
miremba - shhh  :)<BR>

clarrie - the library which contains "horrid strings" (which is the original name) is produced by LA-bas<i></i>ed Spectrasonics - it's called "Distorted reality 2".  It's available to anyone willing to pay the $300 for it, and contains hundreds of sounds.  I hear some very popular (and distinctive) sounds all over TV and film scores sometimes (that's when I know to stop using them).  But hell I'll sue anybody.  Just point me in the right direction.<BR>
<BR>
I wish I could play piano as well as my wife does!<BR>
<BR>
KiMnUS - can't help you on your sheet musiuc problem sorry.<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander - :)<BR>

Polgara - e me please!<BR>

DeM - Who exactly?  Haven't heard it yet.<BR>

MeeB - Nothing lined up for the hiatus yet, but I'm close on a couple of things.  One might be my first big orchestra thing, but's a bit of along shot.  I'm almost done with "Cheer Fever" (cheerleading movie with Eliza D) and "Broken Hearts Club" (little indie gay relationship thingie).<BR>
<BR>
Lovely Poet - on the contrary, Blues Clues Rues!<BR>
<BR>
Pooka - didn't mean to belittle your question.  The truth is I don't know where exactly I get ideas.  Good ones come when they feel like it.  *Workable* ones I can summon at will, which is good considering my schedules and deadlines.<BR>
<BR>
My wife is playing a lovely rendition of a Mozart sonata on our piano.  mmm nice.<BR>
<BR>
DeadGal - e me the same questions, I'll answer them when I get a chance.<BR>
<BR>
SlayerGirl - partial list, in chronological order:  Elvis, Styx, Asia, Journey, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, New Order, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker, Stravinsky, Debussy, Ravel, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Danny Elfman, Bjork, Thomas Newman.  For "Buffy" pretty much Elfman, Bernard Hermann, Jerry.<BR>
<BR>
tattoo-chick - I started writing songs when I was 11.  Never knew how much fun writing for movies and TV was until I tried it, though, which was after graduating from college in 1992.

X-Lander, wolfguard - heh, I knew someone was going to ask me that.  The answer is unfortunately no.  I make them for promotional purposes, paying for them out of my pocket, many of them self-produced demos, and there are a limited number for people who may wish to hire me in the future.  Now I understand you may wish to hire me in the future, but that still doesn't get you one.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks clarrie.<BR>
<BR>
MeeB - that sound in the dream sequence (if you must know) is "Horrid Strings" from a collection called "Distorted Reality 2" through a strong low-pass filter.  Essentially it's a synth sound I created by modifying a store-bought sound off a CD.  And only because you asked:<BR>

I'm excited for two reasons 1) day off and 2) Jason Bentley played my brother's single (no. 87 in the UK last week) on Metropolis last night on KCRW.  Meaningless to most of you I know.<BR>
<BR>
Hey if one of you sees Polgara, or someone else with that baby pool, could you ask him/her to e me?<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - Me?  Procrastinate?  Actually I'm off for a while, no Buffy till sometime next week.  Just finished ep 17.  Anyone want a spoiler?<BR>
<BR>
Wolfguard - good questions.  While writing the show, the music editor (Fernand Bos) gives the music cues simple, denotative titles, as well as a numeric identifier, which help me to keep track of them all.  I'm making these up here (I don't have access to the original notes) but the Buffy/Angel cue in GD2 could have been called "Angel Leaves", the dream sequence "Buffy's Dream".  They also get the numeric identifiers like 1m5 which means the fifth cue in Act 1.  For use in public I try to come up with more interesting titles (on one CD I made, I called the dream sequence "Counting Down from 730").  Christopher Young (excellent film composer) always has very clever titles on his soundtracks.<BR>
<BR>
The shift in tone in GD2 as Buffy looks at Faith's unconcious body was deliberate and requested specifically by Joss to be at that moment.  He really wanted the audience to feel Buffy's determination coming to her in a rush as she was looking at Faith - a definite transition from the affection she's feeling for Faith to a fierce resolve to kill the mayor.  Musically it's a shift from slow, high strings and woodwind, to medium tempo, insistent low brass.  This is a fantastic example of the power of music - you look at it without any sound, and it's just Buffy staring.  But with the music, you really feel the shift in her mindset.<BR>
<BR>
Hi slay_me - thanks for the encouragement<BR>
