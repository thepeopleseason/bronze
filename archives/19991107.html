Fuzzy Girl - I don't like to post in blue because I won't want Jane and Erika to get mad at me for using their col<i></i>ors.  How about I just put this in blue?  Or did you mean the darker one (which you can't really read anyway)<BR>

Hi XG, hang in there<BR>
<BR>
Crab! - OK, next time I'm in Perth - you & me buddy.<BR>
<BR>
Rose - the crossover... was I supposed to say that?  Oh and there isn't really another board... but how could I possibly have a better time at any other board than this one?<BR>
<BR>
X-Lander - I do a Buffy ep in anywhere from three to six days depending on how much music (ep 2 was an all-time low, ep 4 was up there near the top) and how much PANIC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gotta go take the dog out for a little wee-wee<BR>
<BR>
<small>I heard Aly  so Milano and Tony Head really didn't get along too well on the set...

Fuzzy Girl, Mesuvius - There will be a return of the B/A love theme soon enough.  And I'm working on a BIG Xander/Prue love theme for the "Charmed" crossover.<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - Yeah, ocer at the Practice posting board they treat me like crapola.<BR>
<BR>
fibs - I have a general idea what the most requested score bits are, but it will still be a bitca to decide the rest... and by the time it does happen it will be only harder.

Angelus - Hunh??!  This is the first I've heard of ther being no score on the Uk version of the soundtrack.  That kinda sucks.<BR>
<BR>
Kathgrrr, Shannon14, theyoung1 - thanks<BR>
<BR>
Jewyll - I became a composer out of laziness.  It's easy, it's fun, and people want to pay me for it.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man - That's a pretty good bet.  Whatever it ends up being - it's gonna be a big ole bitca to decide.<BR>
<BR>
Mélanie - is The Messenger any good?  I kinda hated The Fifth Element.<BR>
<BR>
Crab! & Rose & Mesuvius & Ouroborus * horizon - hi<BR>
<BR>
Crimson Kahn - The emotion in my music is actually the sound of PANIC.  As in, "I have to write how many minutes by *when*?"<BR>
<BR>
AjO - thanks and yes thank you for the card.<BR>
<BR>
horizon and anyone else - I don't mean to start any crazy rumors.  See below for the real reason.  And it's not the "Charmed" one.

Moriah - I'm kinda taking this weekend off... so I do get rest occasionally.  Right now the only stuff of mine that's available commercially is the soundtrack to "Guinevere" (which you can get at amazon.com and cdnow) and the one little track on the Buffy Soundtrack.  Your only other option is to go to the CBCC and download some season 2 stuff (and soon, I hope, season 3 stuff), or call my agent, and convince her that you are a big shot movie producer and you want to hire me.<BR>
<BR>
Crimson Kahn - I go to Canada at least once a year.  A little brrr for my tastes but it's (literally) homey.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Fuzzy Girl, Kiera<BR>
<BR>
Labrynth - Yeah, The Practice is a well-respected show.  BUT.  My hear lies with Buffy.  Sometimes on the practice three notes in a music cue is two too many.  It just can't support the bold gestures I get to make in a typical Buffy episode... So, while being a choice gig, it's not necessarily as musically satisfying.<BR>
<BR>
Strawberries - Interesting parallel you draw there, I don't remember it being intentional but it wouldn't suprprise me if those two moments end up being related.  See above re season 3 stuff at the CBCC - it shouldn't be too long.<BR>
<BR>
Ahh, I see Kristen has visited the newsgroup recently...<BR>
<BR>
Jewyl - You'll recognize me - I'll be the one trailing puddles of sweat<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie - ep 8 was pushed back because they decided to nix the B/A crossover idea and go with a "Charmed" crossover instead.<BR>
<BR>
Oh and also because Joss is directing ep 10 (or 9?...) right now things tend to get pushed back... but they get always get done eventually.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks BtVSChick and Nyx<BR>
<BR>
Beth - yeah, was I supposed to do something I didn't?  If so, sorry... in any case my e is above.

AjO - I plan to be there but with my schedule this year anything can (and does) happen.  (and this for X-Lander too:) There is definite interest to do a score CD.  But first Fox wants to give the song CD a nice long window to do its thing on its own.  I would bet money on there being a score CD in stores by the start of season 5.  I know that's not too soon but I don't like to lose bets.<BR>
<BR>
Hi to trbl4Giles, Brandi the Slayer, MAPB, Fasteddie, Sachiel (it's crowded for a Sunday!)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks slay_me<BR>
<BR>
Brewster - that's me, I compose 'til I decompose<BR>
<BR>
Ron/FSMGuy - hey back, and your boy Mark Banning has been doing some nice work lately.<BR>
<BR>
Hey Mélanie, long time no see, how are things in frogland?<BR>
<BR>
Megdalen - indeed we have a good dose of A N G S T pn the way, what between ep 6 and 8 there should be a national kleenex shortage.  On the other hand, when I did ep 7, I felt like I was scoring a huge action movie.  It was fun.<BR>

<BR>
To those who asked, work is very busy (composing for Buffy & The Practice, supervising & partially composing Angel) but taking a slight lull as Buffy ep 8 gets pushed back a few days.

Oops.  Darn it.  I'm getting IM'd and it's making me mess up.  I just deleted a post I had all ready to go.<BR>
<BR>
Let's see.  Oh, I wanted to answer that my fave ep to write was Band Candy because it was my first.<BR>
<BR>
And I wanted to say hi to all who greeted me... I know Btvs Chick and Motorcycle...Boy were among them.

Cordy called Dennis her "roommate" -- I'd take that seriously.  Of course, we're not in her apartment all that often.  I wonder if he'll be there the next time we go there? *g*<BR>
<BR>
Ah, well... I've got some Buffy to write... gee, you guys are gonna love this Spike scene... guess I better go write it!

Lord Coyote asked four interesting questions below.  Three of them have affirmative answers.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I agree that Charisma was amazing... I'm blown away by her acting.  Wait'll you see this funny funny FUNNY bit she has in Angel ep. 10 -- omigod, I was falling off the couch laughing when I saw the dailies!

Yes, I'm sorry I missed the Vegas party too.  I was thinking about going, but I had just been in Vegas the prev. weekend with my parents.  I will attend the PBP though, so I'll see you all there!<BR>
<BR>
About the pattern of strong/weak eps on Buffy and Angel... we never make anything less than wonderful on purpose... if something doesn't work it's because either we screwed up, or because of human differences in what we like!<BR>
<BR>
Someone asked about my next ep... It's a Buffy and it airs two days before Thanksgiving, whatever that is.

Hi everybody!  We were incredibly busy at Buffy this last week and I didin't get a chance to post after my Angel  ep aired, but I lurked a tiny bit (David Fury had the Bronze on the computer in his office), and I saw many sweet things that people said about the ep.  So I just wanted to pop in and say "thanks"!
