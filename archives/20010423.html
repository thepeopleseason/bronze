<DD>DeAn - How about "Bitch-slapped by Fury."  Now there's a sig I can get behind. ;-)  <BR>
<BR>
Glad you didn't take it to heart.<BR>
<BR>
chi - You're welcome.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, must run.  This day's not gonna start itself.  (whatever the hell that means.)<BR>
<BR>
Later.

<DD><a1ua1295>Hey, Carrie.  Where've you been hiding?<BR>
<BR>
AYLDT - Nope, missed it.  Yeah, still trying to get tickets, but I'm determined to see it.

<DD>Sorry, janni.  As part of our deal with TLC, Buffy writers are no longer in the position to remove articles of clothing for any ANGEL characters.  <BR>
<BR>
Must everyone have to suffer?!

<DD>Carita -- Did you get the things I sent to your old address?<BR>
<BR>
Narrator - Let's get YOU in a speedo.  I mean it.  I'm gonna write that up this minute.

<DD>Morning, all.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, it's occurred to me that I may have been a teensy bit rough on Ol' DeAn:) and his "Fury's favourite girl" siggy.  (A lame joke on my part that stared me in the face every time I checked out the Bronze happenings.)<BR>
<BR>
In any case, just wanted to apologize and tell Dean he's been one of the lucky few to experience my infamous crankiness.  It's an honor I don't bestow on just anyone. ;-)<BR>
<BR>
It's all this pressure about moving to the Learning Channel.  I gotta go study.
