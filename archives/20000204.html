<DD>Thanks, sanj.  This show has the greatest bunch of fans.  Some of else may never experience this kind of loyalty again, so we're enjoying it.

<DD>Inca Gold - My decision was bas<i></i>ed on the fact it's a GREAT show and Joss is a genius for this kind of smart pop entertainment.  (Kind of a no-brainer - which is good 'cause I have no brain.)

<DD>Velvet Slayer - Congratulate the winners for me.  (I never win anything...)<BR>
<BR>
Library Chick - Perhaps it's not clear that Giles does not need to be near Buffy.  Giles is the father figure going through an empty nest syndrome.  It's a phase he's slowly making his way out of.  Be patient with him.  And with us.

<BR>
Vox - Again, no idea what you're talking about.  What flame?  And as far as Kate goes, talk to Angle Man.

<DD>Davids chick - Of course you can call me that.  You're my chick, aren't you?  (Oh, wait.  You probably mean Boreanaz).  Anyway, in answer to your question... I can't answer that question.  Sorry.

<DD>epitone - Joss is pretty much the architect of character's fates, though his ideas change and grow throughout the season.

<DD>Thoin - PLease, relax.  You're getting too stressed.  Seriously, as I stated, Xander's current character arc will play out next season, and so I imagine will Giles', though we've not had much time to discuss it at length.  <BR>
<BR>
They will have their moments, but the dynamics of a post-high school experience is that there is bound to be some splintering.  It's natural.  Any contrivance like making Giles the campus librarian and X his assistant is forced and, to be redundant, contrived.  <BR>
<BR>
Trust in Joss.

<DD>Vox - In answer to your question... I don't perceive Kate to be any kind of "superhero."  In fact, the original take I had on her was a much more f**ked up individual.  <BR>
<BR>
The point was for Angel to connect with someone who turns out to be something more than she appears.  Didn't seem like that much of a cliche to me at the time.  <BR>
<BR>
Is that what you wanted to know?  Or am I still not understanding the question?

<DD>I'm afraid, AjO, no amount will suffice.  That drunk irishman sleeps with the fishes.<BR>
<BR>
Spacebabie - Love Bruce.  But personally I don't think we'll ever see X's father.<BR>
<BR>
lordcoyote- no, possibly, there are no such things.  What kind of a show do you think this is. ;-)</SMALL>

As to Drucilla - one day... one day... when you least expect it...  I'm just saying...

<DD>buggo - I'll let you know after I check it out.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Seth is coming back.<BR>
<BR>
justjo - I actually answered the Angel in the sunlight thing in ANGEL ep. 10 "Parting Gifts."  (At least, I tried.)<BR>
<BR>
Amd Ringo wasn't available, so instead we got Pete Best.  Hope that works for you.

<DD>Lovely Poet - Mr. Brimley has hot yet closed his deal to appear.  (Some controversy as to where we wanted him to wear his tusks.)  Reps are working to iron out the issue.
