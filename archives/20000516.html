<DD>Lady Wolfsbane: I re-read my post that you refer to and my eyes just keep rolling: maybe it's later than I thought, how many spelling mistakes can one make in one post? I think I set the record.<BR>
<BR>
mriemba: the inspiration: easy! it comes from the episode! Great shows like this are a composer's dream: the inspiration is easy.<BR>
<BR>
exhile: Oh believe me: I'm from Australia and I have to think carefully about what season of the year I say I'm in. Still think of July as snow-skiing at Mt. Hotham for example.<BR>
<BR>
White wings: the 64 million dollar question: chocolate or caramel? How about chocolate covered with caramel, then layered with cholcolate again? Yes, that is my final answer.<BR>
<BR>
Melody: Thanks!<BR>
<BR>
I too feel the need ti sit back and lurk, clear the traffic, 'coz where's Joss?

<DD>horizon: Thanks! My favorite eppy, hmm thats tough to decide, I really liked HERO, even if it chewed me up inside ("I don't believe it, I don't believe it" I kept sayin'), I really really liked tonights eppy with all the Wolfra, & Hart development and all the studd Lindsay went through, and the "Five by Five" episode might be my all time fave, and the last eppy (NO SPOILERS) I really had lots of fun with.<BR>
<BR>
Whim: My full name: you mean its a bit long to type in ye weary eyed bronzers?? How about "Rob": that's what I'd want you to call me in person.<BR>
<BR>
Antipodean: we need to get the creatice bronzers (you know the ones: they put lines through their text of spoilers whilst eeryone else wonders how they do it) to come up with a way to show musical waves with text.<BR>
<BR>
Alaric: Bronze during summer is a cannibalization fest heh? any way to stream that on internet video?<BR>
<BR>
Hitomi: a long time to just reflect, I suppose. I reckon I'll be lurking a bit.

Lady of Buffdom: I love the Bronze: its great to work on a show where you can get feedback about the episode from viewers.<BR>
Thanks for the compliments.<BR>

<DD>My computer is wigging -- jst ate a long and facinating post.  Bummed.  As for Willow and Tara, we DID cut away from a touch, but not because of censorship.  In the script, Tara rubs Willow's shoulders, but it didn't look natural -- too perfunctory -- so we cut around it.  Couldn't fool you lot, though.  Damn you!

<DD>IrishGAL, I didn't write this one because I didn't want to do the giant end-of-season two-parter again like I did the last two seasons.  The season ends on a much different note this year.  This was our big climax (and big it was, nes't pas?) but there is more to say, and a whole new way of saying it.  You'll see.

OK--you guys are killing us--we are trying to read everything and we sit here high-fiving--we are such dorks, but you are making us feel great...thanks again.  As for our lawyers in the group, specifically Adri, Blueyedjenn and Coma girl--we love you guys and to use a cliche--you can't handle the truth.<BR>
Antipodean...FYI  Christian is all about the caramel--oh lord, i can't imagine what he just started with that one...well, we have to go get ready for work and actually learn our lines...it is weird not having to learn things like.."Your Honor, I feel our client has been misrepresented" or "we have a hostile subterrestial in sector 72" --this normal speak stuff sucks.  Finally, I can honestly say that Christian is glowing right now--he thanks you all to no end for making his virgin appearence a special one...we will be back...have a great night, enjoy the finales next week, and hopefully, we will be around to chat for a while with you---'night

Hey all--we are sitting here with pen and paper and loving every minute of it--Christian is in awe of the whole thing and is just amazed at how nice and complimentary you all have been towards him, the show and his performance. I on the hand, know you are just being nice to him because it is his first time, as you all were to me.  then the REAL posting crowd showed up the next time around...and ripped me a new one.  But seriously, we are glad you guys all seemed to like the episodes....and hope you feel the same about next wek. again, sorry we can't reply to everyone individually, although we'd like to--we have an early call time tomorrow so we can't stay long...

Okay... can't go just yet, not when someone mentions Something So Right!  Brown-eyed Girl, you are correct, I wrote for that show for its first season... how funny  and nice that anyone would notice!  I worked in sitcoms for a few years.  I'm sure you remember the fine programs "Monty" and "Me & The Boys"-- no?  Ah well...<BR>
<BR>
Bye now!

Okay, starting to wrap things up now... but first, a few more things:<BR>
<BR>
Jack -- Hi, meant to say hi earlier, you said some nice things.  About Pangs, all the stuff you're talking about came right from the big Joss fella... he knew what he wanted from that ep right from the start.  Smart guy, no?<BR>
<BR>
I don't really know anything about the fan site blackout or the video release of eps, sorry... <BR>
<BR>
Okay... it's possible that I'm leaving now, (although that's always so difficult)... great talking to all of you!

Hi Amezri, nice to meet you!<BR>
<BR>
Suzanne -- very good summary of my DS9 -- that was the one.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Ian, Hi KAT -- happy to be here!<BR>
<BR>
AboutBuffy's character -- please remember that she's under terrible stress all the time -- worlds to save, final exams, etc.  And I think I'd be a little self-absorbed too if I were the Chosen One... I mean, you're kinda allowed to think the world revolves around you if it really *does*, right?  (I know I've always felt this way and it's working out pretty well for me.)</SMALL>

Wow -- so many people here all of sudden... may not be able to address all of you!<BR>
<BR>
Lovely Poet -- always great to see you... looking forward to talking more with you soon!<BR>
<BR>
To answer general questions: no more Espensodes this season, but I'm spending the hiatus coming up with evil thoughts for next year.  And I will be writing an Angel next year, too.<BR>
<BR>
Someone saw my Deep Space Nine -- love to hear that -- that was a great experience (And it allowed me to write for Armin for the first time).<BR>
<BR>
Cosmic Bob asked about W/T feedback... yeah, we've gotten letters, but it's a lot smaller reaction than when I worked at Ellen -- I think people are starting to be slightly less shockable.<BR>
<BR>
Chrissy asked which eps I wrote -- this year it was Harsh Light of Day (the one with Parker), Pangs (thanksgiving), and Superstar (jonathan).

Hi all!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Dark Lady, yes we just began our hiatus, but we have already spent several weeks working on the new season... fun stuff on the way!<BR>
<BR>
Hi Clarrie -- sounds like good praise to me -- thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Hi andyourlittledogtoo -- Okay, more Giles, got it.  And you need a cool job -- that'll take longer, but I'll see...<BR>
<BR>
Hi Monique!  Sorry you'll miss the ep... taping it, I hope.<BR>
<BR>
Hi nessie -- sorry you're not liking Buffy's character this year --  it wasn't our intention -- unless you find that innovative and cool.

Hi Little Bam Bam --  Things are cookin' just fine, thank you!  Happy to be here.<BR>
<BR>
VampDuster -- Adam is very strong.   And yet it doesn't sound like us to just have him kill Riley immediately... or does it?
