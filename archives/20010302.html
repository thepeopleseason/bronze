<DD>Lisa H:  I know what you mean.  I felt the same way.  Don't let anybody ever tell you you can't make it -- you can.<BR>
<BR>
miremba: No -- wait!  Steve DeKnight really is Rob Kral!  Didn't you hear the rumor?  (Sorry Rob.  She tricked me into revealing our evil secret.)<BR>
<BR>
Fancy Pants: Souls are very overrated -- yet valuable.  How do you think I got on BTVS?<BR>
<BR>
Lester:  Hey, no sulking in the corner!  You're crowding me!  Sure I remember you.  Where's my 10 bucks?  *g*  <BR>
<BR>
Boo: Once you get the site up I'll send you some never-before-seen photos of the, uh, amazing Steve DeKnight.  You'll laugh till you cry.  I know I did.<BR>
<BR>
That's it for me, folks.  I'm halfway to sprawling face down on the floor (from exhuastion, not the evil rum and coke).  I'll try to drop back in soon one afternoon when I'm shirking my responsibilities at work.<BR>

<DD>Boo: Chivalrous and non-smutty are my middle names (as far as you know).  Dashing, however, really requires a pencil moustache and a smoking jacket.  Maybe next year.<BR>
<BR>
Lurking B: Too many obsessions to list. My obsessions have obsessions.<BR>
<BR>
Nightspirit:  Beats me.  But if somebody throws me on a plane, I'm in.<BR>
<BR>
Lisa H:  Congrats.  Good school.  Actually, they're all good if you love what you're doing.

<DD>Algerina:  Steve DeKnight has no idea what you're talking about.<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie:  Actually, most writers lean more towards self-loathing.  Makes 'em work harder for their own respect.<BR>
<BR>
Boo: Ah, yes!  The Red Hood!  It's all coming back to me now.  Never should have said yes to that second rum and coke.

<DD>Lisa H:  Cool.  Where're you going to school?<BR>
<BR>
Boo: Thanks.  Now somebody out there does in fact have a picture of me kissing a monkey.  Would love to see it.  Ouh Ouh Eee Eee.<BR>
<BR>
Algerina:  Go on!  You guys are too nice.  Hope you still feel the same way after you see my next one.

<DD>Fancy Pants: You're too kind.  And I love your name.  In fact, I'm wearing a pair now.<BR>
<BR>
Boo: A tough question with only one answer: chocolate covered caramels.  My only weakness (besides that pesky Kryptonite).  DeKnight's Riders?  Giddyup!

<DD>Amberlynne: Where did you see these alleged pictures of me?  And -- more importantly -- did I happen to be kissing a monkey in any of them?

<DD>Boo: The fawning was perfect.  Just the right amount of cooing.<BR>
<BR>
Kenickie: Thanks.  Nice to know I can still rock.  Now I gotta work on my roll...

<DD>Finally got a minute to stop in. Big, huge thanks to everyone who attended the PBP (yeah, I know, I'm really late).  That was my first one, and it was a total blast.  You guys are great.  Hope those who couldn't make it this year can join us next year.
