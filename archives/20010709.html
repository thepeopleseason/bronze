<DD> Okay, I'm out of here.  See you in the next Bronze life and thanks.  This was the first site I visited well before I even met Joss or David when I was looking for info on Buffy, and ending up here all red and vip-y has been smashing.

<DD> Yes, a long and extended Numfar arc would be great.  Not only can the guy dance, he writes amazing songs.  <BR>

I command you all to join Fury's Fanatics.  I mean, if you want to, that is.  The web addy is timminear.net<BR>

<DD> How are they going to bring Buffy back?  I dunno.  But Marti does.  What was the purpose of going to Pylea?  To rescue Cordy.  Also, something way cuter than those books came back and it's a Fred.

<DD> Informant -- the spec script is a sample *for* the agent to use.  The way you get your spec script to an agent is to have someone who knows the agent pass it along.  I know it sounds like a closed circle, but it's not so much as you might think.  Not if your spec script kicks ass as it should.

<DD> RooCH, you write and direct prospectives?  Cool.  No advice on that.  But if you want to write television, you need to pen a spec script of a well-thought-of show.  Get ahold of scripts from your favorite show, see how they do it, then you do it and use it.

<DD> Regarding recurring characters that have appeared on both shows -- we get Angel, Wesley and Cordy for sure.  Faith nor Harmony are sked at the moment.  But there's always hope.  Of course, we own Numfar.

And how did Scaott Muriphy get color so fast?  He hasn't even had a freakin' ep produced yet!  (see, if ya spell it wrong, black and white...)  hi, Scott.

<DD> LW--I'm glad I waited long enough to see you.<BR>
<BR>
Likely my last post at the origina Bronze, ladies and gents.  It's been real.<BR>
<BR>
A final thought to leave you with, as you go off in search of other things to occupy your minds until such time as we all meet again.  It's a quote from Tolkien.<BR>

<DD> Actually, Pol, in a situation like this, I'd say anarchy rules.  Screw the four posts an hour rule, family board niceties.  Go directly to looting and pillaging, do not pass go, do not collect $200.  But, then again, since I'm always on my best behavior, I'd never actually recommend such a course of action.  Just, y'know, point out the possibilities.  (In high school, I was a notorious instigator).

<DD> Kristen, there's gotta be a whole grammatical rewards system based on this now.  I'm thinking, okay, you got an article.  I'd like a preposition.  Like "during."  During is a good word.  During Golden.  Hmm.  Not sure that's working now.  Guess the system doesn't work for everyone.  :)  Let's try it on Polgara.  She gets a preposition too.  HOw about "Down" Polgara.  Hmm.  That'd be handy when she whips out the cuffs.

And . . . can someone tell me why Kristen has an article in front of her name?  :)

<DD> Thanks everyone.  Kind of just popping in here.  Sorry I have no idea what's going to happen next, but I am certain there WILL be another site, probably soon.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, though, I'd also like to offer sanctuary to everyone at my message board (threaded, sorry to say) "No Rest For the Wicked" at www.christophergolden.com<BR>

Feel free to coopt the space and go on about your business until such time as the Bronze lives again.<BR>
