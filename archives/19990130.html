<DD> OK, I'll have one more post after this then I'm off to that Laser disc I mentioned earlier. <BR>
JenniferLynn: Thanks<BR>
Drufan: The Spike and Dru storyline was supposed to go for a bit this season but unfortunately Juliet Landau became tied up with a feature film and was not availible. I have not heard if they will be back this season aside from Spike's one episode. But we all LOVE working with them and look forward to seeing them soon. James is to thrilled with all your attention. he gets recognized everywhere.<BR>
AJO: A lot of questions. I started in the biz because of Dark Shadows. I was fascinated by it. I was in the theatre by 12 and a tv studio by 17. History from there. E-mail me if you really want to start in the biz. Noz4atu@aol.com<BR>
Jennie: Same answer as before. I will be a member of any club, but cannot participate.<BR>
Samantha: yes<BR>
Horizon: It is MY PLEASURE!<BR>
Rydini: To take the average person and custom create a vamp make-up - about $2000.00. However, we do generic pieces on the show to cut costs. They are about $200.00 per make-up.<BR>
tanya*: sorry for the shorthand. I'm not familiar.<BR>
Drufan: I know about france as we all do. It's great news. Giles future? We all just wait for Joss to send the word.<BR>
Buffy Summers81: Send the book to the show and I'll send it back. No problem. E-mail me later for an address. <BR>
Sarah W: yes, whern one "House" designs all the make-ups some things are bound to look similar.<BR>
Horron: The Wish took 28 extra make-up artists to do.<BR>
Erika: Lovely, I look forward to it. I used to go to the Rose Tattoo all the time. I saw Louis Edmunds from Dark Shadows sing there,amongst MANY others. <BR>
Hello: Elizabeth, BronzeK8, Labrynth<BR>
I may not be able to post again.

<b>Avarice:</b>  Yes, there is the big Key Club show on Friday, March 19th.  You really should try and get out here for that one.<BR>

<DD><b>Todd:</b>  OK, I know which one will be for you, then.  =) It's called "Fall Away." Very pretty...though not really a torch song.  (I do those, too, ya know!  I sang at the Rose Tattoo when I first came out here.  And Marty and Elaine wanted me to do Thursday nights at the Dresden room, but I had acting class, so NOPE.  Then I discovered the band.  The rest is l'histoire.<BR>
<b>elover:</b> yes, I take that as a big compliment!<BR>
<b>drufan:</b> I've heard of them , but I don't know their stuff.<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>  Oh, yes!  The Buffy EP is our new CD.  6 tracks.  Very cool.  I think there's more info on our site.<BR>

<DD> Good evening Erika. Thanks, I'll be there, but if you sing to me it'll have to be a ballad, I'm a torch fan. <BR>
Ozman: Sorry, the last time I was a fanm of "bands" I fell for Tommy Dorsey. I was raised on that stuff. If you force an answer, of course, it's Velvet Chain!<BR>
Tanya*: Rob Zombie?<BR>
Christopher: I haven't done many other shows with monsters. Aside from the actors, of course....<BR>
Lady Bathory: We all come from different schools. Savini is a contemporary, I was raised on the work of **** Smith and still hold him as my hero.<BR>
Sarah W: I am currently occupied with a Martini Amour (liquor Amour with Kettle One), but if you go to the PBP you may indulge my fancy there :d<BR>
Devil: we recently had a situation where because of a schedule change we had to do a demon overnight. He was put together with bits and pieces of other  monsters. I'll wait for you to guess when the episodes have aired. That was tough.<BR>
Aurora Star: Our friend has done an admirable job of answering for me. I will only add - don't dabble. You MUST want this career more than anything in life, otherwise move on. It's not worth it. The hours and frustration can make one crazy. The pay has a ceiling and the only gratification is makeing it onto a hit show like Buffy and having so many posts! But one can work for years without ever working on a hit...just making the rent. <BR>
Cosmic Bob: E-me with the breakfas plans. I'll see iof I can wake up in time.<BR>
elover: Charisma's make-up was intentionally downplayed this season as she is a touch older than the others and we were trying to make her look a little more youthful. She is just too beautiful and womanly to be a teen. We love her.<BR>

<DD><b>AjO:</b>  So glad you like it!  "Can't Stay Away is one of my faves, too, but it doesn't seem to be as popular as some of the other tunes.  (So, we have the same taste, see?)  Yeah, you'd better save your pennies!  lol  No, really, the Buffy EP is a must-have item.  Well, for V.C. and Buffy fans, that is...<BR>

<b>Tanya:</b>  Actually, yes.  I love Cake, and also Radiohead, neither of whom I think sound like us.  (Well, especially Cake.)  I also really like Pearl Jam and Nirvana, circa '91.  hehe<BR>
<b>AuroraStar:</b>  Well, it looks like a beautiful dress, and worth the price.  (Now, I'm not condoning this sort of thing, but *my* prom dress cost $600!  ACK ACK!  But I wore it to both Junior and Senior prom.)<BR>

<DD> OK you guys, there is a lot to write, bear with me. <BR>
Christoper: Seth doesn't go into the wolf outfit these days as he is tied up with "Austin Powers II". His stunt double Lee Whittaker is in the suit. the make-up takes 2 hours, the wig and facial hair about 30 min. the suit about 30 min to get into. The lenses last.<BR>
Lovely Poet: what episode was most busy? Well, the Wish was tough - very hard work, but the Zeppo was tough too. This season every episode is hard!<BR>
Aurora Star: Smokey eyes. It's all in the liner. Begin with a soft grey all over the eye, then a darker grey from the lashline up. Thenm use a black cake liner and softly smudge it into the darg grey then add a black shadow over the blend to make it seamless.<BR>
bec: we use fresh appliances each time we do the make-up . To construct the mold takes about three days.<BR>
Mr. PointyII: I'll tell her, but i don't hug....<BR>
Buffy Summers81/ Samantha: OK, the first time we did the make-up in season II we used a stand-in for Seth in stage two wolf. For that stage we glued crepe wool allover his body, but for the final wolf it is a suit. The fur is synthetic. Basically expensive funfur. Remember, this is a tv show - we don't have the budget to make a hand-tied fur suit like Coppola's Dracula. <BR>
Bruces Mom: I have no idea if Cosmic Bob is James, but I know James very well I think and I don't think he has a computer....Willow as vamp. Hold your seats - you may have some fun in the near future.<BR>
Samantha: I stopped posting while on AOL. I got so many IM's and E-mails I couldn't concentrate. I'll answer all e-mails at a later date. Anyone can E-me at Noz4atu@aol.com<BR>
HELLOS: Nad, Angelover24-7 - thanks, Jeaa, Cosmic Bob- thanks, SLaYeR, Margot, tanya* <BR>

<DD><b>meteor:</b>  sure, go ahead!  If you get some cool footage, I'll probably ask for a copy!  ;-)<BR>
<b>NuPhalanx:</b>  I'm still oogie, sorry to say.  Yes, the CD is a hard-to-find item in certain parts of the counrty.  Grrrr...  You may want to just order it straight from me.<BR>
<b>samantha:</b>  hi, there!  Want you to know I am sending your stickers on Monday!  =)  Loved your survey responses, btw.<BR>
<b>Pam:</b>  Nah...just that it's been delayed again.  Til at least Fall.  =(<BR>
<b>Pixie:</b>  Hi, there!  well, it's our own composition (really not officially offiliated with the show) called the Buffy E.P.  It's a 6 song CD, featuring our Buffy song (you may have heard about it?) the original version of Strong as it appeared on NKABOTFD, and other brand-new and/or rare unreleased tracks.  Very cool.<BR>
<b>Buffy Sheridan and Angel Lover 24-7:</b>  Still of the oogies!  I hate it.  Ack.  the CD is DONE.  Yay!  (Now, we just have to hope the printer gets 'em done in time.  *gulp*)<BR>

<SMALL>(Sat Jan 30 19:38:54 1999 207.217.246.41)</SMALL><br> 

<DD> OK. Let's give this a go.<BR>
Angl Man: As you all know, Optic nerve designs the creatures and supplies the prosthetics. I do not believe there was an intentional nod to "Little Shop". By the way. I just recieved in the mail the nes release of "Nosferatu" in the original uncut German version. I can't wait to view it.<BR>
Lovely Poet et al: The Zeppo guys were fun. It was a very busy episode. I hope to put this one up for next years Emmy as so many of you responded to the make-up I figure that is a pretty good indication.<BR>
Samantha: Not Normal? Like this is different for me? I have never turned down a club invite, but I do not have the time to participate. I barely have time to post.<BR>
RJ: Watch and see...<BR>
SIN: Now Joss has said the Xander is the character he writes which is most like himself. We wouldn't want to kill Joss off, would we?....<BR>
Buffy Sheridan: Remember Optic nerve designs all this stuff. I apply it and design the col<i></i>oration. We work together very well.<BR>
LadyJack: The make-ups took from 3 to 5 hours depending. As Parker was the most decayed, I did that one and assigned the rest to my associates. We rarely have alergic reactions, but when it happens we immediately remove the make-up and the actor goes home. No more problem.<BR>
Ozman: Ange? Well, I can say that I will helm the first three episodes, then an associate will take over to run it as i go back to Buffy for season 4. (Great Gods!). As for the rest we are all in the dark.<BR>
Twister: Response garnered. I did lots of vamps for halloween. friends you can't say no to....<BR>
Stakeme@420: OK- what di you want me to say?<BR>
HELLOS to: Fly by night, Pam, Jeaa - thanks, Aurora Star, Meteor, Marie 101 Angelus7 - thanks. <BR>
Deep breath.
