<DD> I have to go to bed now - (bore) - but thanks for all your kind words. I can tell you nothing about the end of season, and have no spoilers. A: Look for the hodge-podge monster coming up. Toughest job on the show? Keeping my sanity during the long hours and often chaotic schedule! Night all.

<DD> Bruce Mom: The Balthazar make-up was about 5 hours for the face and head, then only about 20 min to tack him into the suit.<BR>
Ms Alucard: I have always been a devotee of **** Smith. I do not love gore. Mr. Savini has made a career out of the gor-shocker-crude joke thing and though I appreciate his artistry, his general work is not to my taste. I have met him, though and found him to be quiet and gentlemanly. I als admire the many amazing artists who have trained under him.
