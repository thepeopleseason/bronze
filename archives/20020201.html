<dd>Cal:  That man with the red beard’s been lurking around again?  Security!<br><br>Bullseye:  Battlin’ Jack Murdock never misses a PBP.  But since he’ll be writing episode 19 right smack in the middle of it, he might look a wee sleepy.<br><br>Bethia:  Buffy’s going to start being nicer to Spike when he stops being an evil dead vampire guy with a chip in his head making him play nice.  He’s evil, I tells ya!  Evil!  Seriously, it’s a complicated relationship.  These things take time.  Sometimes they end well, sometimes you get a stake in the heart.<br><br>Jason:  Welcome to the fold.  Thanks for the kind words.  They’re much appreciated as I tremble towards writing my next ep.<br><br>Frodo:  Joss is indeed a wise man.  You guys remember Lois & Clark?  The fans screamed for them to get married, and the showrunners made it so.  Then the fans promptly stopped watching.  I’m just saying.<br><br>Dancing Fool:  Ahhhhhhh!  The new DK2!  This is irrefutable proof that Frank Miller is now officially insane.  What a great heaping pile of crap.  Ahhhhhhh! <br><br>Raindeer:  Steve likes the sauce.<br><br>Wend:  Four more eps to break till the end, including mine.<br><br>Bethia:  Dead Things.  Hee hee hee.  Watch it with someone you love.<br><br><br><br>Okay, gotta fly and be free.  Hugs and pokes all around.  Send the amazing Tiggy your pics so I can see who’s stalking me.  And Tiggy, if you’re out there: you’re the best.  I owe you e, on the account of me sucking.  <br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Raindeer:  Saucy!  Yeah, see the difference between Buffy and the other superheroes is that Buffy lives in the real world (albeit on that includes demons and monsters).  She’s more like Peter Parker without the photography skills.  <br><br>Frodo:  Many plans for Dawn.  Hee hee hee.<br><br>Abt:  I have the trousers and I’m not giving them back!<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  I believe we of the Buffy ilk will be penning a few Firefly’s next season.  Nothing official yet, but confidence is high.<br><br>Cori:  Don’t you worry about the future, baby!  The beautiful people are, well, beautiful.  Yikes!  As for my fave ALW – you gotta ask?  JCS!<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  The pic of you and your mom?  You bet.  You both look so cute!  Can’t wait to meet you guys at the PBP (and the rest of you malcontents, too).<br><br>Eiriefaerie: Thanks in advance.  I’m very happy with Dead Things (and I’m NEVER happy).  Kudos to big Jim Cotner for a wonderful directing job.<br><br>Wendy:  I’m sure gonna try to make it to the Succubus Club the day after Dead Things.  But I’m gearing up to write ep. 19, which starts filming Feb. 22, so I’m not a hundred percent sure.<br><br>Natasha:  I’m leaning more towards Kung Fu lesson myself.  Perhaps Jeet Kune Do or Northern Shaolin.  Give me a year and we’ll spar. <br><br><br>Gotta run in a sec.<br><br>
