<DD> Hey guys, gotta run so this is my last post (for now, anyway - I'll be back!)  Sorry to hear about the BritTV Angel butchery.  Not sure what (if anything) can be done about it, but I might start looking into that.  Raithen - I totally agree about the Nursery Rhyme stuff - if you read comic books (like I do) check out the latest issue of DC's JLA - they're currently doing a very dark and cool take on the whole Grimm scene.  Ducky - I can't promise a lot of Giles in 7, but Tony's a fav of mine, and we'll be giving Giles plenty to do this season.  And Anya's Guy - okay, I'll spill the beans - in episode 17, we'll learn that the entire second season of "Dawson's Creek" was a dream.  See ya!

<DD> Narrator ... Sorry, I'll lay off the MetsTalk.  I feel your pain from '69.  But before I do ... Anya's Guy - I must tell you, you struck a chord!  Cleon Jones was my favorite all-time player growning up.  I wear #21 on the Buffy softball team in honor of the great Mr. Jones.  I have his autograph from '73 and I learned to play wearing a "Cleon Jones" model mitt.  But enough for now.  And Beckytvslayer - in the UK they think Angel's a kid's show?!?  Shock and disbelief are mine!  What kind of "kids?"  And who the heck are "they" anyhow?  Just wondering ...

<DD> Raulrocks ... sorry you're not grooving on the Dawn storyline - but I must say - anyone who can be that specific about his/her vomit content has my eternal respect.  Well said!  And Narrator, my next episode will be #7.  Not sure about the airdate (sometime in early/mid-November).  It was a blast to write, and watching the filming of it was one of the all-time lifetime career thrills for me.  James Marsters is a brilliant actor, and he gets plenty to do.  I've been here three seasons now, and this is the most excited I've ever been about the show yet.<BR>
Did I mention ... GO METS!

Anya's Guy ...<BR>
I'm a huge geek, okay?  And I love Star Trek!  Keep those crossover/"homage" ideas coming ... I won't rest until we've done our own "Amok Time."  And the "Corbomite Maneuver?"  One of my all-time raging geek favorites.  Be careful what you wish for.<BR>
Oh, and GO METS!

<DD> Horizon ... funny you should ask about the "Matrix" of last night's ep.  I think "No Place Like Home" is the first one I've done in awhile where I wasn't actively ripping off the "Matrix," though your points make a lot of sense.  I can see the parallels.  But no, the movie I was stealing from this week was "Resevoir Dogs."  So there you have it.  When are they gonna release those "Matrix" sequels, anyway?  We need fresh material to pay "homage" to.<BR>
Oh, and to everybody else ... If you're missing out on the Tara/Amber of "Buffy," I can guarantee you'll like episode six - written and directed by Joss his own bad self.  And for the James Marsters fans ... episode seven is for you.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed! :)

<DD> Wow ... really overwhelmed by the responses here.  Thanks!  To try answering a few questions, re: Safarigirl.  Okay ... 1.  Yes, we'll delve more into Slayerness (history, purpose, that kind of stuff) in season five, but it won't necessarily be because of Dawn's presence in Buffy's life.  Although, having Dawn around will obviously affect Buffy deeply.  Vague enough for ya?  2.  Joyce's illness - supernatural or real?  Stay tuned.  3.  Beast Girl - what can I say?  She's obviously a lot physically stronger than the Slayer.  Buffy's gonna have to find a way to beat her.  4.  Less Riley?  Again, stay tuned.  and 5.  No Amber?  I love Amber!  Both the actress (she's just the greatest) and the character.  Only reason she wasn't in last night's ep. is, there was just too much stuff packed in there - no room!  I'll definitely write for her as soon as I can - I'm looking forward to it!  <BR>
Oh, and Motorcycle au Pair ... doughnuts are okay, when they appear (we get the occasional Krispy Kreme, shipped straight from Heaven) and as for the coffee ... I'm a major caffeine snob - it could always be better.

<DD> CosmicBob, do you mean Mere Smith?  Har!  Lemme tell you, the Beast-Girl pales in comparison to the kinda damage Mere could do if we set her loose.  All said with love and affection.  No, I think of the Beast-Girl as more of a TV or movie studio executive.  Not exactly sure what she wants, but knows she wants it now.

<DD> Hey any/everybody.  Doug here.  Thanks for all the thoughts (pro and con) regarding Dawn.  Anybody out there?  Feeling chatty here at the BtVS offices.  We're all here, tune in.
