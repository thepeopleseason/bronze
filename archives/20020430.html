<dd>SlvrStar - Thanks, but all the Lilah scenes were written by the beautiful and talented Mere Smith when the episode came in short and I was busy writing BUFFY 22.<br><br>jossarama, Drew Prime - ditto on the spider bit (though I think it was the contribution of the gorgeous and talented Jeff Bell.)<br><br>

<dd>reskitty - Ah, that is quite a mystery isn't it?  Must mean something, doncha think?<br><br>SYATW - Hi, Becky's cousin.  Hope to meet you, though no telling how busy I'm going to be at work in Sept, so we'll have to wait and see.<br><br>DaLilBit - No more pressure than usual.  Every one up til now's been great since they've all been written and directed by Joss.  <br><br>No one's work, be it writer or director can live up to that, so I just do my hacky best and hope I'm not burned in effigy at the next PBP.<br><br><br>white wings - Honestly?  Don't know.<br><br>

<dd>Evening.  Glad to see most (I think it's most) of the East-coasters and such enjoyed the ep.  And to those who didn't, sorry to disappoint, but, hey... There's more of my crap where that came from! ;-)<br><br>
