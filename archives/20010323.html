<DD>Leila: I stuck around just for you.  No, I'm not worried about the WB/Fox deadline passing.  Buffy will continue next year, we just don't know where yet.<BR>
<BR>
Creep Crawley: I will tell you nothing!  Nope!  Can't make me!    Well, okay, one little thing... Moloch definitely WON'T be showing up in the season finale.  He had another gig playing a toaster.<BR>
<BR>
Algerina: I'm half-baked most of the time, although on the weekends I have been known to dial it up to extra crispy.<BR>
<BR>
And that's it for me, folks.  I'll try to stop back in next Friday, time permitting.  As always, thanks for watching our little show.<BR>
<BR>

<DD>Again, please don't take offense if I don't answer your questions personally.  I'm only one man, for the love of Fury's pants!<BR>
<BR>
Rikki: I don't know about Boo, but I'm definitely going to be using your suggested battle cry.  Hopefully later tonight.<BR>
<BR>
Janni: Don't worry.  I always work in a little monkey love reference too.<BR>
<BR>
For those of you that missed last week's pledge drive, I promised to post a topless He-Man pic of myself on DeKnight's Riders if you crackerjacks get the membership up to 300.  Come on!  I dare you!  Chicken!<BR>
<BR>
It's always a Steve Deknight day, Lil Pia.  Remember that and you'll never be sad (unless you're Steve DeKnight).<BR>
<BR>
I often call Fury "Big Daddy."  Especially when he's bouncing me on his knee (but only when he's wearing pants, of course).<BR>
<BR>
We don't start writing again until June, assuming there's no WGA strike.  Usually our scripts are written somewhere around six to eight weeks before you see it on TV, I believe.<BR>
<BR>
The fear of poverty spurs my inspiration.  That and the candy.  Yum!<BR>
<BR>
Angst is good for you.  And eat your veggies!<BR>
<BR>
Boxers, of course.  Let's see... Hey!  I'm wearing the green ones with the little yellow chicks.  My fav!<BR>
<BR>
For the last time: chocolate covered caramels.  <BR>
<BR>
What the hell's the BBS?<BR>
<BR>
Big warm thanks for all the congrats thrown at me and Rebecca for getting picked up next season.  We couldn't be happier.<BR>
<BR>
As for super specific writing questions, why don't you guys e-mail Boo.  He'll put them together (after he stops cursing my name) and send them to me, then I'll answer them on DeKnight's Riders.  That way I can give you guys a real, detailed answer.

<DD>Boo: No sucking for you!  You da man!  Many thanks for heading up DeKnight's Riders.  I'll try to work up that bio stuff for you this weekend.  For those of you that haven't joined -- what are you waiting for?!<BR>
<BR>
Rikki: Thanks.  I hope you guys in the UK like Blood Ties.  And might I add I think you've given Boo a new battle cry for DeKnight's Riders: "Pants off people -- DeKnight's in the house!"<BR>
<BR>
B.R.I.T. Admin.: Sure!  And hey -- why doesn't my name appear in color?  It's a conspiracy, I tells ya!<BR>
<BR>
Vampric Acid:  Yes I do have a new character that Joss won't let me use.  It's an old baseball player called Pantsless Joe Jackson.  I say we get a petition going!<BR>
<BR>
Creep Crawley: There's only one Steve DeKnight!  I won't stand for any cheap imitations slandering my good name!<BR>
<BR>
PS: Angel IS hot!<BR>
<BR>
Diablo: You know it, baby.  Strap yourselves in -- the rest of the season is amazing.<BR>
<BR>
EverDawn: All the actors have totally blown me away.  No kidding -- each one is incredible.  As for writing, I can honestly say that I love writing for Amy the best.  Squeak squeak!<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so if I try to answer every question personally, you'll get about two posts from me.  Let me see if I can cover some general questions:<BR>
<BR>
My pants are extremely fresh today, thank you.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I know many dark Buffy secrets for years to come.  But I don't repeat them to anyone -- not even myself.  (All my Buffy fan friends hate me.)<BR>
<BR>
Let me set the record straight.  I do not appear as an avenging giant turnip in episode 100.  I'm a giant legume, thank you very much.

<DD>Hello right back at you fine upstanding citizens.  Life's treating this kid just dandy.  I got the official word today that I will be back next season (as will Rebecca Kirshner -- a huge cheer for her).  Speaking of the amazing Rebecca, she wrote an episode 19 that's gonna knock you dead.  Great stuff.  As is episode 21, written by the astounding Doug Petrie.  My own little slice of Buffy, a.k.a. episode 20, wrapped on Wednesday.  I hung out on the set quite a bit and loved what I saw.  James Cotner did a great job directing.  I can't wait to see it cut together.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, yeah -- I'll be hanging around till 5PM Pacific Time, so unlimited posts for all!  And party hats if you have them.
