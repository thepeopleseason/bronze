<DD>RSO's to all...<BR>
<BR>
<b>singsinthe car:</b>  It was <i>supposed</i> to be last night, but they screwed up the schedule, and it aired tonight.  In the future, you can hear Velvet Chain on an upcoming episode of <b>Sex in the City</b> and you may eventually be able to see me in an indie feture film called "Smack."  I have a starring role, and the film has been picked up at two festivals so far.  We're hoping to get some kind of distribution...but maybe it'll go straight to video.  I'll let you guys know.  =)<BR>
<b>Rosebud:</b>  I'm saddened that the show will be going to a network that doesn't have as wide an audience as the WB (it's a bummer for the fans), but I think it's got to be the best move for the show itself, or Joss wouldn't have done it.  imho<BR>
<b>Little Willow:</b>  Hi, you rock goddess!  =)  I know, I know...stupid Comedy Central!  lol

<DD>Okay, I lied.  One more, specifically to say hey hey hey! JOHHNY FNORD:  No kidding?!  You teched on Swing Low?  That blows me away!  Come on, give it up!  I gotta know your real name!  That is so cool!  <BR>
<BR>
To fill in the rest of you Bronzers, the first play I ever wrote was a one-act called Swing Low.  In it, you discover at the end that only the main character is alive -- all his friends are ghost that died in a car accident while he was driving.  We put it up at Uc Santa Cruz many a moon ago.  The tech on the show was amazing!  Hey, Johnny, did you tech the Barn Theater production or the big C-100 one that ran with Zombies?<BR>
<BR>
And beautiful Bronzers, please excuse me -- no time to answer any other questions right now.  I'm half out of the door.<BR>
<BR>
TIGGY'S SITE:<BR>
<BR>
Just to make it clear, I want to see pictures of you guys -- I don't need to be in the picture.  I've got a pretty good handle on what I look like.

<DD>busterfan2:  As for for Buffy killing the Knights... uh, did you get the part where they were trying to hack her and her friends into itty bitty bits?  Buffy would never kill a DEFENSELESS person, even if that person had the potential to do great harm (i.e. Spike).  But guys trying to kill her and everyone she loves with pointy weapons?  Sometimes you just don't have a choice.  Also, you might have noticed that Buffy wasn't exactly her cool, normal self, as witnessed by the catatonia at the end of Spiral.  I'm sure this explanation won't please everyone, but we're really pressing for the Buffyverse to become less black and white.  Kind of like it does when you grow up (hence next season's theme).  Or I might have just dreamed all of that.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323:  Ding ding ding!  We have a winner.  I anoint you with the title of DeKnight's Resident Picture Goddess.  As soon as you're set up, I want all of you Bronzers to send in photos of yourself along with your screen names so I know who I'm yelling at!  That includes you too, Tiggy.  Yeah Tiggy! And thanks to everyone else who volunteered.  Nothing personal -- I just picked the first one I saw.<BR>
<BR>
elusio:  Thanks for the kind words.  And can I just say your Dad rocks!  Give him a big hug and a "thank you" from a grateful Buffy writer.<BR>
<BR>
Rob:  The Key lowers the walls separating ALL dimensions at once, not just one specific portal.<BR>
<BR>
Old One:  Hope to be writing a Buffy comic in the near future.  I'll keep you all posted.<BR>
<BR>
Nora: The threaded board confuzles this butt monkey to no end.  Can't speak for the other writing simians.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, that's it for me!  Tiggy, you should contact Boo when you're ready to have him put up a link to your DeKnight's Riders pic site.  Thanks again.<BR>
<BR>
Love you all like a fresh pair of hoola boxers.<BR>

<BR>
Xanderella:  Hey!  Give that hair back!  I don't have enough to spare!<BR>
<BR>
tessa:  Yeah, there is a grand demon/vamp anatomy for the show.  Joss has it all figured out.  He's also got this really cool idea about how to make cold fusion work.<BR>
<BR>
laffin: Nope.  Buffy will start filming at the end of July, as usual.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  Jeez!  The shirt off my back?!  Then I'd be completely nekkid.  Hmmm...<BR>
<BR>
Jipsy Girl:  Thanks!  Nothing like a good ol' BTVS road trip.  Next year we're going to the Grand Canyon.<BR>
<BR>
Kryten:  For next season, I believe Joss has been quoted as saying "Oh Grow Up" is the general theme.  So expect lots and lots of giants.<BR>
<BR>
andyourlittledogtoo: Tied up tomorrow, but give Fury a great big pantsless hug for me.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, one more round then I gotta poof.  But before I do...<BR>

<BR>
Steve DeKnight wants you!  That's right!  Be seen and adored by a Buffy writer!  Here's the deal: you guys know what I look like, now I want to know what YOU look like.  So who feels like throwing together a sister site to DeKnight's Riders specifically for photos of you beautiful DeKnight huggin' Bronzers?

<DD>clairre:  Glad you liked it.  And was it my imagination or was that scabby female minion checking out Ben's good and plentys?<BR>
<BR>
Xanerella:  I'm sure Joss is on the Bronze thing.  If not, we can all just gather at my place  and hang out.  As for a vacation - nope!  Not for me!  I'll be working on the animated show right up until we crank up the live-action writing in mid June.<BR>
<BR>
laffin: Not sure how many eps I'll be writing next season.  The standard is around three. Right now I'm scheduled to pen episode 7, although that might change.  I'll also be poking Greenwalt and Minear to let me do an ep of Angel.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin: Where's my tackle hug?!<BR>
<BR>
Arana:  Thanks!  <BR>
<BR>
Cushy:  Why you little devil! ;)<BR>

Xanderella:  All I'll say is that if BTVS does move to the Playboy cannel, I'll be spending a lot more time on the set.<BR>

<DD>Cashmere: Pants are always optional in writers' meetings.  Underwear, however...<BR>
<BR>
Hel Sparrow:  Actually I'm Story Editor now (all bow to my power cosmic!).  You know, we get together Monday throughy Friday, break stories as a group, goof around, then go off to write, usually at home.  Producers/Writers (Marti, Fury, Jane, and Doug) have a little more input in physical production, if they care to exercise it.  Most of the time we're too busy breaking and writing to be hanging around down on the set.<BR>
<BR>
Johnny Fnord:  I wrote a play pretty much exactly like that (no kidding) back in college.  Great minds, eh?<BR>
<BR>
tessa: Yeah, I got plenty of thoughts.  Step inside my head... "Mmm... peanut butter and jelly sandwich... big screen TV... velcro pants... Kane is a hottie..."  Hope that helped!<BR>
<BR>
Narrator:  You UKers are seeing Spiral right now, huh?  I'll stick around so you can all kick me for killing Xander when it's over.<BR>
<BR>
Mia:  Let's see... Today I'm wearing yellow boxers with little hoola girls on them.  Speaking of my underwear, I'll be auctioning them off on e-bay next month.  Owning a pair will be the next best thing to squeezing my moneky butt! ;) Don't know about the Bronze, but I believe Joss has made UPN aware of how important it is to us.<BR>
<BR>
genrefan:  Embrace my compulsion?  Okay, come here, baby...<BR>
<BR>
Newt:  No, the funs over for Buffy and the Scoobs.  Next up is venereal disease and rolling blackouts.<BR>

<DD>Well I'll just jump right in here.  A bit pressed for time today, so I'll probably have to poof in about an hour.  As usual, if I don't respond to your question don't take it personally.  Just a time factor.<BR>
<BR>
tiggy3323:  Doing great today. Special thanks to you and the other sharp, insightful people who defended my dubious honor regarding the whole Dawn forgetting Ben = Glory.  My subtle sarcasm seems to have eluded some people.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of Ben/Glory, let me set the record straight.  After Spiral, a lot of people were complaining that we must have made a mistake.  Many demanded an explanation.  Then after Weight of the World, the same people seemed to be complaining that we explained the "mistake" too much.  What's up with that?  <BR>
<BR>
Also, as much as we love and respect you guys, your comments on the Ben/Glory memory thing had no effect on Weight of the World.  WOTW was written and shot back in March.  <BR>
<BR>
One last point and I'll let this go and breathe in the Golden Light.  At the end of Blood Ties Dawn "forgets" that Ben = Glory.  From the moment we broke that episode, we knew that we would explain it as depicted in WOTW.  No backtracking to cover any "mistakes".  Joss always plans ahead.  (Not to say we won't ever make a mistake -- but definitely not one that big.)<BR>
<BR>
Okay, feeling better now.  Back to viewer mail.<BR>
<BR>
Joe the Owl: Not sure who's doing the voices for the animated show.  I think some of the cast will, some won't depending on their time commitments.<BR>
<BR>
Marc Brown:  Yeah, BTVS twists your guts up and floods you with emotion.  Hmmm... almost sounds like good television.<BR>
<BR>
Kronos:  Why I oughta... <BR>
<BR>
Cushy:  Thanks.  Drinks and kneeling always appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
*jinx* Speak of the devil and I appear.<BR>
<BR>
Sephiroth:  Don't leave on my account.  And don't be so hard on yourself.  A lot of people (me included) have felt like you do.  Things get better, honest.
