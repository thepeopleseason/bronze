<DD>biobabe:  I only speak the truth. ;)<BR>
<BR>
Narrator:  Oh, they can still fight.  Nekkid jello wrestling, anyone?<BR>
<BR>
Molly:  Oh yeah, know him well.  Great guy.<BR>
<BR>
Risa:  Great idea -- but Numfar is under the Angel banner.  That comic's being revamped (no pun intended) by Joss and the wonderfully talented Brett Mathews.  It's going to be a knockout!<BR>
<BR>
bdbdb: I'll be at the PBP in Feb.  And hey, if you guys put together a DeKnight's Rider soiree in LA, chances are I'll show up.  Especially if there's free Guinness involved.<BR>
<BR>
Pooh Bear:  Riley is going to return, but a miltary experiment gone horribly awry has left him out of synch with our plane of existence.  You won't be able to see him, but trust me, he's there.  Now, where did I put that tinfoil hat?<BR>
<BR>
kronos:  It's a date!  Meet me in front of the malt shop.<BR>
<BR>
Adri:  Yes, Steve DeKnight loves you.  Shhh!  Don't want to cause a riot.<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  I seem to recall reading the first book of The Narnia Chronicles way back when I was a wee laddy.  I'm totally against changing ANY written work unless it's a choice by the writer.  Religion was deeply ingrained in the series for a reason -- the writer wanted it that way. (And this opinion was brought to you by a staunch atheist, btw.)<BR>
<BR>
I seem to recall scrolling past a post asking about when next season starts.  Don't quote me on this, but I believe it'll be around October 19.  But that might be the Guinness talkin'.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And with that, this wittle birdy must fly and be free.  Now as you all know, we of the BTVS writing ilk are returning to work on Monday.  That means I may be tied up in meetings come my usual Bronze sans-pants Fridays.  I'll try to stop in, but I have no idea what time it'll be.  Could be early, could be late, and sometimes I may not be able to make it all.  But I promise to try my best.  I really enjoy chatting with you weevil little imps.<BR>
<BR>
Last Shameless Plug:  Join DeKnight's Riders and send your pic in to DeKnight's Flying Butt Monkeys (if you're over 18 on that last one).  Quick!  Somebody post a link!<BR>
<BR>
As always, luv ya guys like a fresh pair of hula boxers!

<DD>mrgeorgefox:  Haven't heard anything new on the animated show.  I'll keep you guys posted.<BR>
<BR>
janni:  I can't play.  It wouldn't be fair (to me).  Congrats on the new position.  Whip those recruits into shape!<BR>
<BR>
Risa:  A stranger no more!  Nope -- Fray is Joss' baby.  If I'm lucky, I'll get my hands on a Buffy comic gig.  Sweet!<BR>
<BR>
Amish Boy:  Hey, nothing crappy about my pants!  Wait, let me check... Nope!  I'm good!<BR>
<BR>
Xanderella:  Ah yes, the "Race to 300".  Let me set that record straight.  There never was a race, as far as I'm concerned.  The 300 mark for a nekkid DeKnight pic was in no way related to the amazing Minear and mighty mighty Fury.  These are two men I respect and admire beyond words, and I'll be joining THEIR fan clubs as soon as I get the chance.  I am but a novice compared to their vast talents.  So, Allyson and Kristen, no need for war.  Peace, good nymphs, peace!<BR>
<BR>
Christopher Marlowe:  I extend my personal invitation.  Buy it!<BR>
<BR>
@lex H:  I wish.  No time to wing over to the UK.  I gots a show ta write!<BR>
<BR>
nails:  Oh.  Okay.  So what the heck's a kenickie?<BR>
<BR>
Last call, then I gotta get on with the gettin' on!

<DD>genrefan:  All I can say is I'll be writing episode #7, and I think everyone will still be alive or living dead by then.<BR>
<BR>
Dawn Star:  Thanks a bunch.  Of course I remember you.  Hope things are going a lot better these days.  Just wait till you're in your 20s -- then you'll really start having fun.  Sdaly, due to legal reason we I actually read anything you guys write, but I'm all in favor of the acting thing.  Might try to weasel myself onto the show one of these days.<BR>
<BR>
biobabe: A fine idea.  I'll have to run over and pitch it Greenwalt, then twist his arm to let me write it.  Yeah, I love Tiggy's site.  It's great to see all you guys.  Nice pick, btw.  Anyone ever tell you Selma Blair looks a lot like you?  <BR>
<BR>
Slayed Soul:  Yeah, you really need an agent to get in the door in TV and features.  Specs for Buffy and Angel first go through Joss' Mutant Enemy company, then if they make the cut go on to Joss and David Greenwalt.<BR>
<BR>
Head Bitch:  I am quite easily crushed, usually by love.  Sniff.  Sob.  I waited all night outside the malt shop.  Where were YOU?!<BR>
<BR>
Numfar's Pooh Bear:  Yes, Dawn's blood opening the portal was planned from the start of the season.  Dawn cutting herself was yet another bit of foreshadowing.  Tricky bunch, aren't we?

<DD>Amish Boy: Definitely The Thing.  That was the first DVD I ever bought. What's the other meaning of pantless in the UK?  (Keep it clean, now.)<BR>
<BR>
gaelicgirl:  No way am I answering that one.  Except, you know, I'm pretty sure I'd pick one of our lovely writers of the female persuasion.  Although Fury can start a fire with just his winning smile...<BR>
<BR>
BuffyBuff:  Yes, we've noticed all of that -- and more.  We currently suspect that Doug Petrie may in fact be Batman.  He's always hanging around with a guy named Alfred, although he claims they're just good friends.<BR>
<BR>
shadoed:  Aw shucks, go on with you.<BR>
<BR>
clarrie:  Ah!  A horror fan after my own heart!  For those of you who don't know, the fabled missing ending of "X, the Man with the X-ray Eyes" goes something like this:  <BR>
<BR>
Ray Milland:  My God!  I can still see!<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately I haven't had time to check to see if this is included.  Doesn't say so on the package, so I don't think so.  :(<BR>
<BR>
Princess of Darkness:  Can't wait to see it.  Are you going to translate my interview into German?  Cool!<BR>
<BR>
JaClaS:  Anya?  She's purrrrrty!  That's all I got, man.<BR>
<BR>
Informant:  Uh... I dunno.  Let's see.  The two hour season premier will count as two episodes.  That's all I can really tell you (without having to kill you and all your friends and family).<BR>
<BR>
English Kitty:  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Okay, now I get it.  No, I'm against the whole commando thing.  I'm a boxer man, tried and true.  No idea when Fray will hit the UK.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of the UK, everybody do yourselves a huge favor and pick up the entire Sandman series by Neil Gaiman (I think I spelled that right).  One of the most beautiful things I've ever read.

<DD>kronos: Fiction writing?  Talk to my agent. ;)<BR>
<BR>
Dunlin:  Fray synopsis?  Talk to my agent. ;)<BR>
<BR>
Ergoshakes:  82 is a fine, fine number.  Now where can we see these sparkling Underroos...<BR>
<BR>
Circe:  Bravo.  Great job by all.<BR>
<BR>
Thoin:  No pants and no shirt today!  Wheeeeee!  I'm free!  I'm free!  Actually I currently live sans air conditioning in the sweltering valley, so it's the only way to go.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, where's my little Tiggy and the mysterious master of mystery Boo?

<DD>Slayed Soul:  Didn't find a cell phone I liked yet.  I did however pick up two great DVDs.  "Big Trouble in Little China" and "X, the Man with the X-Ray Eyes".  If you've never seen these two, check 'em out.<BR>
<BR>
And before I forget:<BR>
<BR>
singsinthecar:  If you're out there, I still haven't received the package.  Ahh!  Evil frog!

<DD>Greetings, Bronzers.  Let me start off this lovely pantsless Friday with a shameless plug (and for once it's not even for me):<BR>
<BR>
If you haven't snapped up a copy yet, run run run and get yourself one of Joss' new comic "Fray".  Amazing, beautiful stuff.  And yeah, I'd say that even if he weren't my boss!
