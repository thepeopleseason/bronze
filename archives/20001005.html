<DD>Andy - It's all right.  In light of your distress, I've gone ahead and made YOU a dream.<BR>
<BR>
Hope that helps.<BR>
<BR>
Gone.  Really.

<DD>Polgara - no baby news from the front.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the input, nic. <BR>
<BR>
Okay, this fish has gotta swim. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the nice comments regarding last Tuesday's unpleasantness regarding "the most controversial episode of the season!"  TIME MAGAZINE<BR>
<BR>
(Actually Time Magazine never said that, but I'd already typed in the quotes.)<BR>
<BR>
Later, all<BR>
<BR>
And don't forget to pick up your calendars on the way out.

<DD>greeneyes - Well, I should certainly hope so.  My next one is Ep. 8: "Shadow."<BR>
<BR>
DarkLady - Hey, I think I've done my part to keep the men of BUFFY shirtless.  I put Xander in a Speedo for God's Sake.  A little credit please.  ;-)

<DD>Thanks very, DSP.  Miss Kitty will return.  And the Tara speculations are spot on.

<DD>Spinner - the connection's there.  This storyline's been a long time coming.

<DD>greeneyes - I think it was "You look lovely."  (It's been a while).<BR>
<BR>
cian - That, or Uncle Davie.<BR>
<BR>
Pucelle - no.  But cool idea.  Crazy Lunatic Guy is one of those things that will become clearer later.  Like where this "Joyce" character came from.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, how did my Butt Monkey get in here?!!

<DD>Joe - I'd hope you'd have more respect for us than that.<BR>
<BR>
BuffyBuff - I called it a ways back, but it was still disappointing.  Not for the ep., but for the lack of trust and open-mindedness of some posters.<BR>
<BR>
maryl- Sorry it was confusing.  It's hard to establish some things in the context of the scenes.  As for Riley, he's got his own place, Buffy stays there occasionally, but she's about to move back onto campus.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, as always, littledog.

<DD>Jen15 - You're in luck.  My new "Many Moods of David Fury 2001 Calendar" is on sale now.<BR>
<BR>
See me Jolly July, Melancholy March, Sensitive September and, yes, Furious February.

<DD>Kristen - They actually put full soze ships into enormous bottles than leave them in the water too long til it all shrinks.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you had a nice birthday.
