<dd>Okay, one last thing that I think needs to be addressed, then I’m really gone.<br><br><br>Kitty K:  I said a lot of things on the Succubus Club.  And yes, I joked a lot, because that’s who I am – I use humor when things get tense. Perhaps I should have toned it down, but that’s just who I am.   I’m sorry if I hurt anyone’s feelings or if they thought I was being disrespectful to their pain.  But a lot of people are ignoring the most important thing I said:  We treated Tara like a real character.  And yes, we killed her because it advanced the story arc of one of the main characters.  But to say that Tara can’t be killed because she’s a lesbian, or because she’s good, or a wicca, or a woman is totally unacceptable to me.  She’s a character, and that’s not to diminish anyone’s emotional attachment to her.  We try very hard to make the viewers attached to ALL our characters.  That’s part of what we do.  As for those who are happy that “the lesbian got what she deserved” – these are the people I hold contempt, loathing, and disgust for.  That’s just plain ignorance and hate, and I openly call for them to stop watching the show and any show I ever work for.  We killed a character for story reasons – not because of her sexual orientation.  I truly find that suggestion offensive, and anyone that thinks that should be ashamed.  We presented Tara as a person, in a relationship that was filled with ups and downs.  Not a gay relationship, not a straight relationship – just a normal relationship in an abnormal world.  It was beautiful, it was as real as we could make it, and I’m very proud of it.  And yes, things ended badly for Tara – but not because she was a lesbian.  In the Buffyverse, happiness is almost always the harbinger of doom.  And she was happy.  And she will be missed.<br><br><br><br>*gone for real this time*<br><br>

<dd>Dogmeat:  I don’t spell so good.  Uh, well!  I meant well!  Aww crap.<br><br>Dallas Viewer:  The Spike/Buffy scene in Seeing Red was really hard for Sarah and James, but they worked through it and gave a great performances.  My multiple hats off to them for that.<br><br>Corsa_am:  I have a fabulous 4 weeks off.  Just enough time to fly to that secluded island somewhere in the Pacific…<br><br>Slayerdaddy:  Niiiiice!<br><br>Freaking Amazing Witch:  Nothing personal.  Just have to be careful.  Especially now.<br><br>Princess of Darkness:  Of course I’ll join DeKnight’s Groupies.  Been one for years.  I promise I’ll try to e you when I get back from vacation.<br><br><br><br>Okay gang.  Thanks for the kind words.  And as always, don’t be afraid to voice your opinions – in an intelligent, rational, non- insulting way, of course.  I don’t expect people to love everything I do (heck, I sure don’t).  But I do expect them to be nice (and sarcasm is always welcome).<br><br><br>Stay real – and stay away form those spoilers!<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>

<dd>Lilangel:  Yeah, the title Seeing Red had several meanings.  First and foremost, it was about anger.  Lots of angry people in this ep, and different ways of dealing with it.  Then of course there was the literal “Seeing Red” when Tara was, um, you know.  And finally Willow’s eyes in the end, which wasn’t actually in the script.  There they were just black.  Not sure who’s idea that was, but it was a great one.  <br><br>SB:  Tim is still going to be consulting on Angel and writing and directing episodes.  We’re not letting him get away that easy.<br><br>The Partyman:  Thanks.  And yeah, I totally think people are entitled to there views.  Like I’ve always said, I complain about TV shows all the time (even my own episodes).  I know many people are upset about Seeing Red, and I do understand why.  But I also stick to what I said:  We treated Tara like a person on the show – not a lesbian person, just a person.  If Willow had been dating a man in ep. 19, he’d be gone now too.  And to all the people who scream it was just a plot point, well, uh, yeah.  Everything we do is a plot point (hopefully).  <br><br>One more, then I gotta fly.<br><br>

<dd>Lil Angel:  Vin Diesel IS one hot cookie.  Can’t wait to see XXX..<br><br>Steveisgod:  Finally, someone with a handle I can get behind.  Although I’m more of a minor deity, with imp like tendencies.<br><br>Narrator/Tiggy/All:  Very few people know my email address, and no one knows my actual address.  Not even my fiends.  I only meet them in public places.  If anyone wants to write to me, address it through the show.  But be advised, it usually takes a couple of months to work its way through the system.  And dogs sniff everything before it gets into our hands.  No kidding.<br><br>Darth Angelus:  I look better in a dress, too.  But hey – wasn’t Tabula Rosa one of the best eps ever?  Loved that one.<br><br>

<dd>Halfrek:  Thanks.  Oh, and one thing for you all.  Some people have misconstrued my statement on the SC about Tim leaving Angel (if Firefly gets picked up for a full season) and me going to Angel.  I in no way meant to imply that I would be replacing Tim Minear.  Not possible.  I’ll be going in at a much lower level, and besides – he’s a rare genius and a beautiful man who has no parallel.  I can only hope to be half the person he is one day.  Heck, I’d settle for a tenth and count myself lucky.<br><br>Tiggy:  As long as there are people like you out there, the crazies don’t bother me.<br><br><br><br>Guests just arrived.  I’ll be back in a few.<br><br>

<dd>Grimjack:  You’re absolutely right.  I don’t respect the fans.  That’s why I keep showing up to talk to them at the Posting Board.  Just to remind them that I hold them in utter contempt.  That’s sarcasm, by the way.  Look it up, jack.   If you didn’t like the episode, that’s your right.  I’ll discuss that with you reasonably and rationally.  But don’t presume to know me – or take cheap potshots.  That, my friend, is truly a lack of respect.<br><br>Hansel:  Thanks.  Couldn’t agree more.  Well, maybe a little bit more, but that would involve actual work.  I’m against it!<br><br>Dogmeat:  Thanks.  OMWF probably won’t be released until the season 6 DVD comes out.  I can’t wait either.<br><br>DowntownApartments:  I’m crapping in mine.  We should get together.<br><br>Lil Pia:  Send me copies of some of your art.  Would love to take a look.<br><br>ErinSpud:  I’ll try not to kill off any of the Angel characters.  Unless it makes a good story.  Hee hee hee…<br><br>

<dd>Extra pressed for time today (as usual), so I won't get to answer anywhere close to all your questions.  If I don't respond to you, don't take it personally.  I'd hug you if you were in the room.  Hug, I said!  Hug!<br><br>DallasViewer:  Excellent points, as always. I really appreciate how you present your ideas.<br><br>To All:  Thanks for the kind words.  Steve feel better now.<br><br>

<dd>I'll be dropping by to take another round of quick lumps in about a half hour.  I predict an escalation from point-head sticks to the A-bomb following my Succubus Club appearance.  <br><br>But first a quick reply to slayerdaddy (oh, the lurkage).  The Willow/Tara reconciliation was planned before we even started working on season 6.  You might take issue with where it was placed, but rest assured we didn't wake up after episode 18 and say "Oh my gosh!  We need a Willow catalyst!  Let's shoehorn Tara in there!"  <br><br>You know, you think I would have learned my sarcasm lesson by now, but I'm a little thick.  Guess I'm just still a little stung by the truly horrible things being said on the Kitten board.  Especially things like "He doesn't respect the fans."  You guys know I do -- but I am almost NEVER serious. Humor funny.  Insults not so much.  I understand they’re upset, and perhaps I should have been less “DeKnight” on the SC, but that’s just who I am.  <br><br>Okay, rant over.  Love you guys like a pair of warm boxers on a chilly night.  <br><br>Be back in 30.<br><br>
