<DD><b>Mentheus</b> - - So far, the fourth season has been a multi-part storyline about earthquakes.  Of course, that all ends in episode #5 when Cordelia's "parents" come to town.<BR>
<BR>
<b>kugelmass</b> - - lol about the "Hector" thing.<BR>
<BR>
And, by the way, that spot is where I spilled my Diet Coke when the quake hit.  I did not... repeat <u>not</u> have an accident!  So, let's just put that to rest right now.

<BR>
<b>Witchy Woman</b> - - Honestly, I posted (because I know from experience that during these things, it's nice to know other people are feeling it, too), then I immediately unplugged the computer to call my wife (only one phone line in this apartment) to wake her up to tell her that if she hears about an earthquake on the radio when she wakes up tomorrow, that I am okay.

<DD><b>Kalika</b> - - See, I really am nice.  Just a few minutes before the quake started, God knocked on my door (at first, I thought he was another stripper sent by <b>peri</b>) and he asked me for directions to your house.  He said something about needing to come down from the heavens and get you or something.  So, I gave him a fake address just a few miles outside of Joshua Tree.  So, you owe me a big favor!  Now, who's mean?

<DD><b>aglaea</b> - - I am a veteran of one quake.  I lived four miles from the epicenter of the Northridge quake of a few years ago.  $300,000 worth of earthquake damage to my house.  This one wasn't as bad as that, but only because I knew my family was safe, no matter what happened.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kalika</b> - - I did the curling up into a ball thing during the aftershocks.  But the main quake was all shrieking and running around bumping into walls.

1st to call the earthquake!<BR>
<BR>
<b>kugelmass</b> - - My accent is mostly Houston (which the locals pronounce "Yew-stun"), with four years of Austin thrown in and years in Los Angeles and Seattle trying to lose it.<BR>
<BR>
<b>KANE</b> - - Not interested in overthrowing Bill Gates.  Not with the Micrsoft Death Squad, version 4.0 that roams the tiny island where I live.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so this was an aftershock of a '92 quake, just as <b>Tiamat</b> guessed.  Way to go, Seattle!  First to call the quake, and first to call the origin!  Woo-hoo!

<DD><b>peri</b> - - Nope, these were cops.  Why doesn't anyone send stripping undertakers anymore?  I can't be the only one who likes that.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Bruces Mom</b> - - Actolerance, you can't tell me story ideas!  If Joss found out, he would never rerun "SAR" or "Passion" again, and I get 25 grand a pop when he does.  So, please... stop!  I have mouths to feed.  (And so do my wife and kids)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer</b> - - I am not <u>pure</u> evil.  There's a lot of malice and mischief mixed in there, too.  Oh, and snails and puppy dog tails.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Destructo Girl</b> - - "A woman can never have too many flowers"?  Man, you sure know how to drop a hint.  Unfortunately, I have lost your address.  Mail it to me and I will wire you flowers.  And your Mom may be <u>the</u> "Hottie Mom" in Canada, but my wife is <u>the</u> "Hottie Mom" down here in the states.  Someday, when they have the big international competition, maybe they're meet.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Sarah-fym</b> - - An Aussie vampire was considered, but with the vamp aversion to sunlight, he would never be able to say "G'day, Mate", so how would anyone know he was Australian.  Didn't think about that, did you?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Sita (tNG)</b> - - Yeah, I'm the "infamous" Ty, I guess.  But, don't be "honored", because it will just make everyone else think you have no standards.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Lovely Poet</b> - - Oh, I just assumed everyone here knew that Cordy's supposed "parents" show up in LA and have to be killed by Angel with an ancient pitchfork in episode #5 of "Angel."  Oops, my bad.  Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Gone now.<BR>

SO's to all my friends (and those who will be)!<BR>
<BR>
Damn, I always miss the VIP's!<BR>
<BR>
It's looking like I will likely be in Vegas for a time on the 30th. Too bad I didn't know sooner or I woulda signed-up! I'll try to swing by and hang out in the lobby! *g*<BR>

<DD><b>thy Slayer</b> - - I'd love to help you out with info on WEB(B), but I wasn't even aware they'd re-opened it after the unsolved string of co-ed slayings last year.  So, obviously, I am out of the loop on that for now.  Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<b>LB</b> - - Well, if you mean the parents who Cordy <u>thinks</u> are her real parents, then the answer is that they are up to no good... as you will see on episode #5 of "Angel."  But, you didn't hear it from me.<BR>
<BR>
BTW, everyone scroll back for Joss and Jane postage earlier in the eve.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Avarice</b> - - Hola!  (Sorry, that's all the German I know.)  Long time, no bump into one another.  Howzitgoing?<BR>
<BR>
<b>AKA</b> - - Weekend lunches work.  Not this weekend, unfortunately.  Meeting prep to be done (as soon as I get off the board).  But e me and let me know when's good.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kalika</b> - - Uh, sorry if I got a little snappish.  I'm up past my bedtime.  It's already the year 2000 here in LA, you know.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Malista</b> - - "Prose"?  Sorry, but I'm not familiar with the form.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Buffy Sheridan</b> - - No more "Buffy" writing for me.  Joss says it is too exhausting all the work he has to do just to try to make me look good.  Besides, I'm always harrassing the actresses when I'm on set.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Destructo Girl</b> - - So what, so you're too good to settle?  My wife settled, and not a day goes by that she spends an inordinate amount of time regretting that decision either.  If women aren't willing to settle, then men like me and scary <b>ripley</b> would never find a mate.<BR>

<DD><b>Angle man</b> - - At the moment, I'm mostly writing posts for the Buffy Board.  I'm in town for meetings and more meetings.  Met with John Landis last week and again next week, for instance.  Interesting insights into Buffy, has he.  Maybe I'll share them some time.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kalika</b> - - "Ty released me"?  What kind of crack is that?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Eiddileg</b> - - Very brave of you to fill in for Seattle tonight.  Thanks.  It will help take the sting out of the real Seattle's absence.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Blueronin</b> - - No, it turned out the police at my door weren't real police.  So, which one of you clowns sent over the strip-o-gram, huh?<BR>
<BR>
<b>peri</b> - - What a coincidence... that's the same song the strip-o-gram "cops" were singing.  It was you that sent them, wasn't it?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Destructo Girl</b> - - Tell your Mom thanks for teaching you to send thank you notes.  As for whatever she taught you about knees... you must forgive her, as she is from another generation.  Probably mine, in fact.<BR>
<BR>
Oops, I just realized my slip is showing.  Guess my Tytannia666 code won't work anymore.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Buffy Sheridan</b> - - Yeah, sorry you missed me, too.<BR>
<BR>
<b>LB</b> - - Re: your second topic: Are you talking about Cordy's biological parents or the parents who she now <u>thinks</u> are her real parents, but will reveal their true selves in episode #5 of "Angel" this season?  Because, depending on which ones you mean, the answer will be different.<BR>
<BR>
Haven't I done enough damage for one night?<BR>

<DD><b>MeeB</b> - - As for your search for Prince Charming, I will just tell you what it took me forever to get my wife to reluctantly accept: SETTLE.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Kalika</b> - - I'll stop.  I have no desire to instill fear.  You are free to go... now, where is <b>ripley</b>?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Malista</b> - - I'm not ignoring you.  Just waiting for the poetic mood to strike.  I fear I may have set the bar too high with the "Odes to Malista" so many years ago.  And then, I ran out of tortured rhymes for "Malista."  Sorry.  I'll try harder.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Jasmen</b> - - My "pets"?  Oh, now I'm a little scared... but in a good way.<BR>
<BR>
BTW, only in LA a couple weeks and already had lunch with <b>-mere-</b> (he bragged).<BR>

<DD>Hmmmm... so this is L.O.S.E.R.s, huh?  Well, I like what you've done with the place since I've been gone.<BR>
<BR>
<b>ripley</b> - - I love you, too, man.  But not in that special way that I love my wife (or Joss, after a long night of heavy drinking), but in a purely spiritual way.  That's what you meant, too, right?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Destructo Girl</b> - - I keep looking for the SMG-signed stake on eBay, but so far, no sign of it.  Does that mean you still have it?  BTW, I'm still waiting for that return letter you kept talking about.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Blueronin</b> - - Yes, Ty lives.  If only in our minds and prayers.  Whatever the hell that means.  <BR>
<BR>
Well... this time watch me really go, because I'm supposed to be writing.  I'll try back some other L.O.S.E.R.s hour.  Maybe on a night when the police are <u>not</u> pounding on my door and demanding that I open up.<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight, all.<BR>
<BR>
And goodnight, Seattle... wherever you are.<BR>
