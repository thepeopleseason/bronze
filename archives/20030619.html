<dd>Oops!  Gotta run, but I'll check back in here later today.<br><br><b>Nikka:</b>  I really hope you can make it to the play before we close!  If you think you can find someone to go with and make your 2-for-1 reservations by 5pm today, that would be even BETTER!  =)<br><b>Mia:</b>  Hi!  Yep, the album is coming along great!  We keep revising the tunes, though, and Jeff keeps getting inspired (damn him!  lol), so that's why it's taking so long.  It's gonna be worht it, though, I promise.  =)<br><br>OK, must leave now or will be late.  See ya later!<br><br>~Erika<br><br>

<dd><b>Smidge:</b>  Hi, there!  Nice to meet you, too.  Pull up a chair, and here's a Bloody Mary for ya.  (I like to put a bit of extra garlic and pepper in the mix...good, huh?)<br><br><b>Nikka:</b>  Hey!!  I would <i>love</i> to come see you!  Truly!  But I'll be in San Diego, rehearsing for my next show.  Pooh.  Are you going to be dancing there again?  Oh, and here's a Bloody Mary for you, too.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys!  This really only applies to people in the SoCal area, but here goes anyway:<br><br><b>Help Support Live Theater!</b><br>As you may know, I am very fortunate to be in West Coast Ensemble's beautiful production of <b>SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE</b>.  Well, there are only 4 more performances left at this point and, unfortunately, there may be even FEWER than that...  <br><br>See, we're scheduled to go up the next two weekends, (Saturday at 8pm and Sunday at 3pm only), with our absolute FINAL performance being Sunday the 29th.  HOWEVER, reservations are so light for next weekend, (June 21/22), that the producers have said that unless a significant number of people have made reservations by 5pm this Thursday, (that's TODAY), they will be forced to cancel the shows this weekend and just have us do the final, closing weekend.  WE DON'T WANT THAT.<br><br>So, what are we gonna do about it?  I'll tell you what!  For this coming weekend only, the theater is again offering the very popular and oh-so-fabulous <b>TWO-FOR-ONE deal</b> for friends of the cast!  Yep!  How's that for cool?  All you have to do is call and make your reservations by 5pm TODAY, stating that you're a friend of mine, and that you're reserving at the special 2-for-1 price.  Easy!  =)<br><br>Please, if you've been thinking about coming to the show, and just haven't gotten around to it, this is the time to come!   Call (323) 525-0022 and make your reservations right away!  The producers will be making their decision by 5pm today, so be sure to call before then if you intend to come!<br><br>Thanks so much, and hope to see you at the theater!<br><br>Love, Erika<br><br>*** West Coast Ensemble is located at 522 N. La Brea Ave., Hollywood, CA 90036 ***<br><br>
