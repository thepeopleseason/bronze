<dd>crap.  last, last, LAST thing:<br><br>i know, over the years, i have garnered a reputation for being anti-spoiler.  this is for one simple reason and one reason only: BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT <i>SHOULD[/b] BE!!!  of course, people have free will, and can make their own choices,  and undoubtedly a few of you will choose to read spoilers until the proverbial Iowan cows come home (they have cows in Iowa, right?  isn't it pretty much just corn and cows and <b>RTBS</b>'s?).  <br><br>however.<br><br>whereas in previous years i have -mere-ly gently admonished the spoiler-partakers, holding them in a certain... oh, i don't know... quiet but rabid disdain, today i'm going to actually plea with all Bronzers: <i>please</i>... <u>don't read spoilers for this season.</u>  this sounds drastic, i realize, and probably a little on the desperate side, but i promise you -- <i>promise</i> you -- you'll thank me for this later.<br><br>that's it.  no browbeating, no dangling carrots (well, maybe a small chunk of carrot) -- make your own decisions.  just remember that sometimes a suprise can be the best AND worst thing in the world... (* cue eerie music)<br><br>peace out, yo.  word, dog.<br>-mere-<br>sigJTT</i><br><br>

<dd>last thing, i SWEAR...<br><br><b>Safarigirl</b>: actually, i prefer it when DeKnight goes pantsless.  keeps him happy and docile, like a pantsless tiger.<br><br>or something.<br><br>GOODBYE for GOD'S SAKE!<br><br>

<dd>okay.  this is it.  i'm going AWAY from here.<br><br><b>KAM</b>mie: hmm... maybe a Milla-Jovovich-in-the-paper-towel-ensemble-from-"Resident Evil"?  again, i say STAIRMASTER!<br><br>Steve is currently on the set at Paramount, watching shooting for ep 7, hence his non-being-here.  i thought he was gonna stop by last night -- at least, that's what he TOLD me he was doing in the other room -- and believe me, it takes a lot more than a few bezoars to chase that guy away.  trust me, i've tried...<br><br>this is me, leaving.<br><br><small>"Really.

<dd>arrghh... it's like the old days... i can't get outta here...<br><br><b>Narrator</b>: i think in Iowa, they call heaven... "Iowa".<br><br><b>Princess of Darkness</b>: nah, actually, i'm too much of a big pansy to have my own fansite.  i'd much rather just ***** about other people's.  in the meantime, i'd love to be # 0 -- are there t-shirts?<br><br><b>Wolfguard</b>: And a good day to you, too, fine sir.<br><br><b>KAM</b>mie ('cause i remember how much you love that): i plan to be in attendance for said PBP -- although i'm having a hard time figuring out how to top the dresses from the last two years.  maybe i'll just show up naked.  better get on that Stairmaster...<br><br><small>"I'm fibbing.

<dd>p.s. hi <b>IMMORTAL</b>!<br><br><b>drlloyd</b>: y'know, sometimes even <i>i</i> call him that "ever $#$#@@ SDK".  but in my book, "$#$#@@" translates to "lovin'".<br><br><b>ektagraph</b>: uh... "Same Time, Same Place"?  uh... huh? we haven't done an ep by that name, and i can't <i>recall</i> a flight attendant, but... i could just be insane.  in the membrane.  (insane in the BRAIN!)<br><br>hello to various peoples whom i know, and to various peoples whom i do not... <br><br><b>Princess of Darkness</b>: now, see, i checked out DeKnight's fan site, and (apart from being horribly intestine-gnawingly jealous -- who does this guy think he IS?  Jesus?  Mohammed?  Shirley Winters?) i wanted to sign up, but i'd be member, like, # 2,473,398.  if you can get me a cool number, say, #0, or # -13, i'm in.  don't want DeKnight to think he won me over too easy.  once i have my OWN fan site, i'm gonna make him pay weekly dues if he wants to join...<br><br>okay, really dashing now.<br><br><small>"What, do you see nipple?"</small><br>-mere-<br>siggyJossTyTim<br><br>
