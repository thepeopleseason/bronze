<dd>Yo ho ho.  Just a quick drive-by to thank everyone for tuning in to our little show this evening.  <br><br>I also want to clear up some misconceptions about Bambi.  That little fawn was evil, I tells ya, pure evil!  It had been terrorizing the lot and attacking innocent extras for quite some several months.  Something had to be done, and I totally support Joss for disposing of it in a humane and cinematic manner.  I for one will sleep a little easier now that the wee fuzzy beast has been dispatched.  Now if we can just figure out how to ride ourselves of those meddlesome kittens and puppies...<br><br><br>*extra poofage, I say, extra poofage*<br><br>
