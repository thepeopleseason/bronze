<dd>Lurker: Hee, I get all giggly when people research me.  Just promise me you won’t listen to a WORD my high school teachers say about me.  Or my rabbi.  And, re: Smallville, not really my cup of tea.  But I have hope for their second season, I think they might be taking some steps to make things better.  I’m anxious to see what they do.<br><br>C. Marlowe: Sadly, no, our time was pretty well-blocked from the moment we got there.  But we took note of the skyline and had a few moments.  It’s amazing how the people refuse to buckle under the strain, they actually got stronger.  Makes me proud, proud, proud to have been born there.   <br><br>Puck: What?  Last season?  What the...?  I’m always the last to know everything.  I guess I’ll just have to go downstairs and talk to Greenwalt about... what?  Oh, crap.<br><br>Okay, my lovelies, time to mosey.  Thanks for letting me hang with y’all.  Hope you’re all doing well.  Talk to ya soon!!<br><br>

<dd>Oh.  Stupid tiny keyboard.  Or, you know.  Big, fat fingers.  Whichever.  <br><br>Heh, heh. Big fingers.<br><br>

<dd>Lilangel: It was a pleasant little New England cruise, from NY all the way up to Halifax, with stops in Boston, Portland, etc.  Then some more time seeing the rest of the family in NY.  It was a blast.  Being back in NY was pretty much amazing.  I forgot how much I love that city.<br><br>Ferol: I will be staying where I am AND writing for Firefly, too.  Have I mentioned I am the luckiest boy in Hollywood??  Cos I am.  Especially with that mockingbird not singing and the diamond ring turning brass and such.  <br><br>And since losing my pretty colors is probably a sign that it’s time to skedaddle, I’ll say one more round, then I leave this electronic coil.<br><br>

<dd>Ferol, Aeris: See, I love how this place is FILLED with people with EXCELLENT taste.  It just elevates the whole discussion, I think.  And you know what?  I’ve seen fire AND I’ve seen rain.<br><br>Old One: Yeah, right, and prove ONCE AGAIN how teensy tiny my widdle itty bitty brain is?  I think not.  I make it a point never to engage in battles of wits with anyone I can’t take.  Thus explaining the hanging-out-with-DeKnight thing, of course.<br><br>Hello, G’s Lucie!<br><br>Kestra: Er, pic of me, pic of me... I think I need a symbol instead.  Like a president in Doonsebury.  It’s better for everyone that way.  (‘Sides, if you look hard enough, I’m told I’m not that hard to track down on this little interweb you kids are so fond of.)  And I can tell you Firefly is gonna be totally unlike anything you've seen before in the spaceship genre.  Very western, as I'm sure you've heard, but with Whedon-esque trademark character and dialogue.  And something about a crew made up entirely of pigs.<br><br>

<dd>OMF and C. Marlowe: You heard about the other Drew already, eh??  I like to think I sort of cleared the path for all Drews there at Buffy, got TPTB to realize what a find we all were.  In the real world, of course, it had nothing to do with any of that, the other Drew is just a really cool guy who writes amazingly well.  Seems like he’s gonna be a neat fit with our little insanity support group.  You guys are gonna dig him.<br><br>Hey, Paks!!  Been outta town (and touch) for a bit, but I’ll be getting’ back into the swing of things soon... It’s all about Gopher AND Marcia, now THAT’S an episode I wanna see.  Or maybe just a Celebrity Boxing.  Whichever.<br><br>Hey, 1cham: I already meet the requirements for that club, then!!<br><br>Lilangel: Thanks for your restraint.<br><br>Lurker: awww, thanks.  Hi back.<br><br>

<dd>Hey, Puck, thanks... I’ll do as many as I can, it depends on everybody’s schedule and how busy we’ll all be.  Should be SO much easier now that we don’t have to keep trying to, you know, cover for DeKnight all the time...!<br><br>Kestra: Cool screen name, btw.  Our summer is actually wrapping to a close, believe it or not, that’s the beauty of the television schedule.  I’ve already spent my hiatus moving to a new place and taking a well-earned east coast trip with my parents and my brother and sister (including a quick stop at the Fox upfront in NY for the Firefly announcement, which, by the way, was SO COOL!!).<br><br>Hey Host!  Hey Adri!<br><br>

<dd>Hello, pumpkins.  Wanted to stop by for a quick moment, cos it's been way too long since I had a Bronze Fix.  Thought I'd grab some hellos before heading out for my Friday evening (which, surprisingly does not, this week, involve sitting on the couch looking for Love Boat reruns on the local stations... okay, maybe it does, but, you know, Gopher cracks my stuff up, what can I do??).  Hope you're all well.<br><br>
