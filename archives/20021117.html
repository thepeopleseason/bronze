<dd>Hey, you kooky kids.  Just my usual lame *** drop by to promote my latest Angel episode.  And if you haven't read the wildfeed -- for the love of all that's cute and fuzzy, don't!  Your jaw'll drop a lot further if you're unsoiled.<br><br>I know I owe quite a few of you some e-mail.  Sorry for the delay, but things have been extra crazy.  I promise to do that and stop by for a real chat just like the old days soon.<br><br>But sadly not tonight.  Got the guests coming over and then I have to be on the set at 7 in the oh my god morning.  So this old dog's gonna be crawling into bed early.<br><br>Enjoy the show.  Be kind to each other.  Eat lots of fiber.<br><br>- Big Steve DeKnight<br><br>
