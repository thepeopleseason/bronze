<DD>Oh!  And a quick plug:  you'll help the band out a LOT if you buy the Buffy EP the first week it comes out.  If we sell 500 copies that first week, we can get into more stores, etc.!  So, no pressure here at ALL, but if you were going to buy it anyway, please do it the first week.  (at Tower or bor<i></i>ders)  Thanks!  Goodnight!

<b>Nittany Lion:</b>  Hi there!  We're from Los Angeles, and you can order our first CD, "Warm," online at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.velvetchain.com">www.velvetchain.com</a>  It has 13 tracks.  Or, you can wait til Tuesday and buy our very own "Buffy EP" (not to be confused with the Soundtrack album) at any Tower Records or bor<i></i>ders Books and Music in the country.  It has 7 tracks, including "Buffy," a song we wrote about the show. =)<BR>
<b>Dusty:</b>  Thanks for the sympathy, and I know, it could be worse.  =)<BR>

<DD>XG - Sorry.  I just have a lot of email.  Sometimes I miss stuff.  I just glance through the lists when I can to keep up with things.<BR>
<BR>
BuffyBrazil - There is one move coming up fairly soon.  Maybe another later on too if I find a good spot to do it:)<BR>
<BR>
salla - I came from a Martial arts and motocross background.  I also raced cars sometimes and so did my father.  I had been making  8mm movies since I was eight years old, so by hooking up with stunt people it allowed me to use what I had to get my foot in the door to somehow work in film.  I enjoy it.<BR>
<BR>
Well... Thanks for talking with me.  I gotta take off now.  Sorry if I missed any question.  <BR>
<BR>
I do appreciate the fans a great deal.  If it were not for yu guys we wouldn't even be on the air.  So thanks again.<BR>

<DD>Thumper - I love multi-level falls.  We just rarely have a set that allows for that.  I also do a lot of wire stunts.  I'd like to put some MATRIX-st<i></i>yle jerk reactions and special kicks on a wire in there.  We haven't done this on Buffy before.  I just don't know if Joss will want it.  All I can do is check with him if an episode seems to call for it.<BR>
<BR>
I did get to jerk Buffy by ratchet once from the library.  I also had her jump really far for Inca Mummy Girl.  (The director wanted her to jump all the way from the front door to get onto the stage.  So that's what I did.)  I know that my exec producer doesn't understand the whole MATRIX thing.  I guess it all depends on what flavor Joss decides is right for the particular episode.  Stranger things have happened.

Basically, I work at Bloomingdale's, and am a very very good and helpful salesperson by all accounts, except today I got completely yelled at today at work by PSYCHO customers...and I was on my frickin' LUNCH BREAK!  Grrrrrrrrrrrrr   They even said, "You should be working in a warehouse, not Bloomingdale's.  You talk and act like a maid."  (My personal note:  Not that there's anything wrong with being a maid!)  They were awful. And I did NOTHING to them.  I guess they thought I wasn't helpful enough when they asked me a question...while I was on my break, and just passing though on my way to the ladies' room!  lol  I should just let this go, shouldn't I?  hehehehe

<DD>horizon - You are correct!  That was what I was thinking of.<BR>
<BR>
Beldin - I rigged Sophia in a swivel hip harness and had the guys build a pulley set up overhead and a place for her feet to push off of.  That allowed us to jerk Sophia up so that she could grab the edge of the roof and flip over to her feet.<BR>
<BR>
Yevonne - Yep.  I have a Little Willow tape sitting right here on the shelf.<BR>
<BR>
Slayergrl99 -I wouldn't be surprised.  He usually comes up with something.  I'm sure I'll be shocked at what the writers are doing.  Even as we speak.  Evil noises emit from the gathering place of the writers.  I don't know what it all means though. Usually that's a sign of some good entertainment coming our way.

<DD> The same thing I always say.  Something like:  "Okay then."  Actually we did something in the water a couple of times.  Fought some Fish Boys and did something else in the old BAywatch tank.  I just don't remeber off hand.<BR>
<BR>
Merlin:  Joss loves John Woo.  I love Jackie.  Maybe we can do a Jackie Woo fight (if you are familiear with Hong Kong films?)  Jackie Woo is a crazy comic character over there.<BR>
<BR>
Malista - Yes.  Next ep. there was a spot to do a fall on campus and I thought we were going to do it.  Joss said "nope."  So that was that.  You'll have to watch and see what I'm talking about as I can't go into it yet.

<DD>Witchy Women - Yeah.  It might be good to clear that up for the ANGEL fans.  Jeff Cadiente does the hiring for MartiAL LAW.  Though the stunts are choreographed by Sammo Hungs Hong Kong guys.  Cadiente did the first ep. only.  He was a friend of the Production Manager, Kelly Manners (brother of Kim Manners of X-Files fame)He had worked with Kelly on SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND.  Now that he has gone back to MartiAL LAW, Spiro has come in to do the show.<BR>
<BR>
Now is THAT too much ANGEL trivia or what?

<BR>
Slayer99 - No.  That was just a cover story for his gayness to remain hidden from the world.  (*just kidding rumor monger - hehe)<BR>
<BR>
H. Alger - I'd ALWAYS love to have more of everything.  Money is just one of those things I'd love more of.

<BR>
devil - I just use whoever is right for the job.  Karen sometimes does the fights for the girl with short hair on V.I.P. too.  Sophia did once and then turned it over to her because she was too busy with BUFFY.  <BR>
<BR>
Jennifer Badger also has doubled Willow and Dru as well as many others aside from Cordy.  She also doubled Inca Mummy Girl.  She's done around 24 episodes so far.

<DD>Malista - The room DOES make all the difference though.  What props can I use?  How much space is there?  Can I even touch the walls?  That's why I'm so jealous over ANGEL's sets.  They are in a big sound stage and get to go downtown (so he can jump off buildings and use air rams and such)  I am very trapped by things that I can't control.  Still... I just try to make the best of it and come up with some way of shooting a quick fight that is somehow different than the last one.  <BR>
<BR>
This just in:  We may be fighting in the grave yard again.  Can't turn around or we will see the trailers.  Can't touch the gravestones unless we brace it on one side.  Oh and the actors would like to go home early.  Hmmm.  Yep.  It's not easy.  Maybe I can get transpo to drive a car in there or something...<BR>
<BR>
XanderGirl - Spiro Razatos and Mike Vendrell with advice from Mike Massa and the stunt vamps.

<SMALL>(Sun Oct 17 19:30:38 1999 169.132.153.119)</SMALL><br> 

<DD>BtvsChick - All I can say is that Sophia is trained to do Martial arts stunts & fights and is the best in the business at it.  Sarah has no Martial arts skills that I have ever seen.  She has mentioned that she once took a class as a small child.  I don't know.  I think she picked up on how to do a couple of movements, like a backfist, from us.  Just not very strongly.  It is physically very tough to fight that way.  There is just no way she could survive it.  It would be a whole different Buffy if we did that.  It wouldn't even resemble the slayer you've come to know.  So the acting should be mostly Sarah and the fighting should be mostly Sophia.  That way we have a good show.<BR>
<BR>
But she is in good health.  She's just naturally thin and likes that look.  I think she admires the look of JFK jrs. wife (forgot her name)  You know, it's more of a model-type look that she likes for the camera.  She has TONS of energy though and can talk ninety miles an hour.  Make no mistake about that.

<DD>Malista - If the fight is very open then it is always easy for me.  I feel free.  If the characters all have lots of talking to do in the middle of the fight and very specific things are written that have to happen at certain spots - then it gets harder.

<BR>
LilBufBuf - I'm putting my bet on the next Joss-directed ep.  (though I have no idea yet if that will be true as I haven't seen the script.  Come to think of it, Joss probably hasn't either)  So just yell at Joss: Big Fight!  Next time he shows up.  Who knows?  It's up to him.

AngelHart - No.  I'm not on camera there.  But I do like the fight we got to do that night.  That's my favorite st<i></i>yle of Buffy really.  You'll see what I mean.<BR>

Ajo - Actually Mike hit his head doing the air ram.  David just bumped his hand on a gun.  Everyones okay though.<BR>
Those jumps are done onto porta-pits, boxes, or an air bag.  It just depends on the circumstances.<BR>

Shadowslayer - Mike Massa - Angel Dbl.<BR>

AngelHart - My friend Spiro is the stunt coordinator and he has Mike Massa (my regular Angel Dbl.) and Mike Vendrell choreographing fights.<BR>
<BR>
Alpy- Well.  All I can do is quote Buffy through the words of Marti: "I'm an evil fighter.  It's simple.  I have to kill her."  Stick of wood is good.  Four wheeler is better.  That's all I meant to say;)</SMALL>

<DD>Alpy - I think you must have not been around for his long-winded personal attacks.  They all started because I dared to come online and respond to the very personal things he was saying about how Joss and I had wasted our time at work by having poor work methods and on and on.  When I corrected him regarding the reasons things were done a certain way it started something and he's never shut-up since.  I'm sure that we'll have to read all about it every week.  He tends to take up a lot of space on our board.  Though it will be carefully worded now so as not to let anyone think there is anything personal about it.  Just opinions.  Well... you have mine regarding him now.  He's not as nice of a fellow as you imagine.  <BR>
<BR>
I have to stand by my own humble opinion.  He's rank. I agree with your last line though.  Why would someone who hates a show and the people who work on it keep coming back to a PB that was set up by the show to promote the show?  That is one for his therapist to figure out.  I'm sure it must be an attention thing.

<DD>Alpy - Nope.  That was no ignorant post.  I was responding to his constant attacks on Joss, myself and the writers of the show.  At that time he was going on and on about how awful we all were at our jobs.  And he was getting pretty personal about it.  So I just gave it right back to him.<BR>
<BR>
Later I learned that he was a frustrated writer and was just spouting venom.  I saw frustrated screenwriters over at the "Alien" newsgroup trying to do the same thing.  I'm sure getting people here to listen to him and actually take him seriously is probably the highlight of his life.  I just don't like mean-spirited attacks on people who are too busy to come online and respond to it.  So, back in July, I did that for all of us here at BUFFY.<BR>
That's all.  We (speaking for some of us here at BUFFY) felt a smile come on when I did too.  Sort like slapping a bully in the back of head.<BR>
<BR>
Sure it was harsh.  But he deserved it.  He had been so nasty to us for so long that it was long overdue.  I see that he's more careful now in his remarks and is less personal.  Maybe he can be nicer.  I hope so.  <BR>

AjO - Kate connects with Angel through their shared loneliness -- their lack of friends, their single-mindedness in their jobs and common goals (getting the bad guys).  But I should clear up the confusion - SHE'S NOT A LOVE INTEREST.  They just flirt a little.<BR>
<BR>
Kalika - I think I'd have to say Cordy's the best.  Love that girl.  Re: If I feel cruel for what I did to Buffy in HELPLESS?  No.  I was glad, GLAD, you hear!  And I'd do it again!<BR>
<BR>
Mesuvius: As of now, my eps are:<BR>
<BR>
ANGEL #2 - LONELY HEART<BR>
BUFFY #4 - FEAR, ITSELF (the Halloween show)<BR>
ANGEL #10 - PARTING GIFTS co-written with Jeanine Renshaw (of VR5)<BR>
Soon to start BUFFY #11 or #12, as yet untitled.<BR>
<BR>
KAM - Tiny Spolier: ANGEL #10 features the return of a  character from BUFFY.<BR>
<BR>
LunaMoon: Giles' firing and replacement were my ideas, but I originally intended the sitch to resolve itself in the ep.  It was Joss and David G. who got excited about making that a series arc.  (I still feel a little guilty Giles' is out of a job.)<BR>
<BR>
All I have time for.  Later, Bronzers.

Sorry to all who were thrown by the reference to an ancient American TV show.  My age is showing.  I will get some rest and come back with a more universal topic.<BR>

<DD><b>wolfguard</b> - - I can't answer your question because beloved characters aren't played by actors and actresses, they are embodied by them.  Was it supposed to be a trick question?<BR>
<BR>
<b>Vaal</b> - - It helps to know the characters I am talking about, but it is not essential to answering the question.  Does that help?<BR>
<BR>
Uh-oh, I'd better go.  There's a strange, orange glow on the eastern horizon that is slowly growing brighter and brighter.  I don't know what it is, but it's heading this way, and I, for one, want to be hiding under the covers when it gets here.<BR>
<BR>
So, salvete.<BR>

<DD>Okay, how about a "Buffy" topic?  <BR>
<BR>
Who would win a fight between <b>Buffy Summers</b> of "BtVS" and <b>Buffy Davis</b> of "Family Affair"?  <i>Don't forget that the Davis is a small, agile target with a perfect 1-0 record in fights with boys in her first grade class (episode #32).</i><BR>
<BR>
Then, who would win a fight between <b>Rupert Giles</b> of "BtVS" and <b>Giles (Mr.) French</b> of "Family Affair"?  <i>Remember to consider that Giles French would have a considerable size advantage.</i><BR>
<BR>
And, finally, how about a fight between <b>Cordy</b> of "BtVS" and <b>Cissy</b> of "Family Affair"?  <i>And I am referring, of course, to Cissy in her prime, circa seasons #1 or #2; not the later, chunkier years when she was obviously not in fighting trim.</i><BR>
<BR>
And please, give it some thought.

<DD>Okay, this is farewell, but in quick scrolling, I saw that I could not, in good conscience, leave without saying "Hello" to <b>Mesuvius</b>.  Didn't mean to ignore you, I just got caught trying to write, IM, post, eat and watch SNL all at the same time.  Sorry.  I'll try to do better next time.<BR>
<BR>
And with that, I'm really, truly out.  Gone.  Un-wired.  A full-fledged <i>*poof*</i>tah.<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight, all.<BR>

And goodnight, NEO, wherever you be.<BR>

<DD><b>AKA BECKER</b> - - When you say "uberboss", do you mean God?  Or one step above him?<BR>
<BR>
<b>THUMPER</b> - - Thanks for the compliment, but all the kudos for "Passion" go to Joss.  He was just a nice enough person to let me keep my name of the script.<BR>
