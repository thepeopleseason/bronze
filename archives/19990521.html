<DD>Angela (and Angle Man):  thanks.  and yeah, I'll e-mail Dark Horse.<BR>
<BR>
Kristen;  hey, thanks!  Nice to meet you.<BR>
<BR>
And now . . . time to sleep.  Be well, all.  'Night!

<DD>Carl--glad to hear it.  I'll be reporting it to Dark Horse in the a.m.  I don't know, maybe you guys think I'm overreacting, but that's just the kind of thing that burns my ass.  You work hard on something (which happens to be your livelihood, and that of your family) and then some moron just gives it away. Sigh.  Sorry if I sound cranky now.

<DD>Everybody who just posted to me, I'm sorry.  I'm just so burnt right now that I've lost focus.  Thanks for the kind words and all.<BR>
<BR>
Angela, loved part one, and the script for part two was just as good.

<DD>EverDawn:  Thanks for the support.  : )<BR>
<BR>
CARL:  IS THAT your site?  I realize I'm in no position to actually do anything about it, but I can't sit here on the PB and see that and not make my feelings perfectly clear.  Whoever owns that site is doing something that is totally illegal.  It infringes upon the copyright and trademark of both the publisher and the creators, and is, in effect, outright theft.  If it is your site, I hope you'll take it down.  If it's not, I urge you not to use it.  I can't tell you how pissed off I am to see that here, on the Bronze.  Those comics are not public property, they are NOT public domain.  Putting up some line about who owns them doesn't excuse the action.  Jesus, I haven't been this pissed in a long time!

<DD>Shadowslayer--great, thanks!<BR>
<BR>
St. G--ya never know.  : )<BR>
<BR>
Carita -- actually, it's a little different, particularly issue #3.  And if you're a Pike fan, wait 'til Sins of the Father.

<DD>AKA BECKER: she promised to send me a copy.  I'm looking forward to seeing our little prodigy in action.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man--JG Jones is a damned fine artist.<BR>

<DD>St.. G -- pretty good.  My bro's getting married tomorrow, and I'm best man.  Gotta make a speech.  Sigh.<BR>
<BR>
EverDawn and Icelord, thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Slay-me:  I'm coming with my eighteen year old nephew, so if you know any girls that age . . . but we'll be there from Thursday to Sunday.<BR>
<BR>
CharlieX: Thanks again.  I sorta pride myself on making that effort.  You should be able to get Codename on Amazon if nowhere else.

<DD>Laurence -- Hey.  Yeah, I've been AWOL, slaving away at the 'puter.<BR>
<BR>
Angle Man--Much appreciated.  I hope you like my new novel, Strangewood, which'll be out in July.  As for Lazarus, why, so far, he's still ON Hell.

<DD>Mon Malista:  Thanks.  How did you manage to get Juliet to sign the comic?<BR>
<BR>
Angela:  Cooler?  Umm, I could get a tattoo, or a piercing, but I just don't think I'm the type, y'know.  : )  Hey, break a leg on those movie auditions, etc.

<DD>Brittany--Hey!  Thanks.  Actually, the reason I won't be doing Angel novels is twofold.  A: I do have a lot of other stuff happening, and B: I'm afraid that I'd be tempted to raid ideas I might used in my own vampire universe and use them in Angel . . . however, I will be writing the Angel monthly comic book series, which starts in November.  As for Springfield, the closest will likely be a Holyoke Barnes and Noble signing, sometime in late September or October.  Nothing definite yet.<BR>
<BR>
SLay-me:  Yep.  I'll be in Atlanta, and can't wait to see you guys there!<BR>
<BR>
Monique -- actually, I'm a guest at visions 99 on Saturday and Sunday.  You should e-mail me through my web site.  Maybe we can set up a lunch or something with Bronzers?

<DD>Hey Angela.  Hope all's well with you.  Thanks for hitting that Talk City chat, though when I finally saw the transcript, I wasn't that happy with the "typist."  Would rather have done it myself.  How are you?<BR>
<BR>
CharlieX -- As a matter of fact, I recently put a revision of Sins of the Father (Nov) to bed, and Nancy and I polished off the revision of Immortal last week.  We're pretty happy with it, and there's some really neat stuff.  At least, we think so.  *g*<BR>
<BR>
Missi-- nice to meet you!

<DD>CharlieX:  God, what a dope.  I've been so out of touch with work and such that I really HAVE lost track of time.  I must have lost a whole week somewhere.<BR>
