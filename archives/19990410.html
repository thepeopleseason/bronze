<BR>
<b>Meteor:</b>  Hi!!  (And bye...)<BR>
<b>Shadowslayer:</b>  Well, it gets a little tiny bit better all the time, so I'm not TOO worried.  But maybe I'll go in sooner.<BR>
Hi, <b>gazoo!</b>  Sorry I can't say and chat.  I'm up way past my normal posting time, as it is!  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
Goodnight, everyone!<BR>

<DD>Getting ready to go...<BR>
<b>JeanieTTF:</b>  YES!  You can use Visa/MC AMEX, and Discover, I believe!  We ship to Canada all the time.  =)<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>  You know the really quiet opera part in "Diva?"  That's Eilleen Farell.<BR>
<b>Lady of Buffdom:</b>  Thanks!  But yeah, I think that's a big part of it:  how it's mixed.  If you heard it louder, maybe you'd think she blew me away!  =)<BR>
<b>L.W.:</b>  Thanks, sweetie!  I must admit, I love switching back and forth like that.  My mom actually sang a bit of opera, and she always said she never knew where I got the belting thing, 'casue she could never do it.  Some weird recessive gene, I guess.<BR>
<b>BUFFY SHERIDAN:</b>  Man, that would ROCK!  I hope we at least get used on the show once.

<DD><b>Keri:</b>  Hey!  That is SOOO cool.  =)  I'm glad you like the song!  And keep singing it at school...it's good advertising!  lol<BR>
<b>horizon:</b>  No meds...haven't gone to the Dr.  I'll give it a couple more weeks.<BR>

<DD><b>JeanieTTF:</b>  hello!<BR>
<b>WitchyWoman:</b>  You, too. =)<BR>
<b>Ladyfo Buffdom:</b>  Why, thank you VERY much!  Actually, on the CD, that is a sample of a real diva from the 50's, named Eilleen Farell.  Hehehehe...I can't believe you all think I sound better than she does!  I am extremely flattered.  We're going to be doing a new recording of the song, I think, and I will be singing that aria myelf this time.  =)</SMALL>

<DD>Um, I forget who asked (as Avarice said, it's kinda late for me), but Jeff is the bass player/main writer guy of the band.  =)<BR>
<BR>
<b>BuffySheridan:</b>Hi!  Would you believe my jaw/head still kinda hurts????  Very annoying.  But I'm OK.  =)</SMALL>

<DD><b>-mere-</b>  I didn't figure anybody would actually jump on the carousel to scrape off the sticker, I just thought it would get scraped off by some LAX unibrow luggage-jockey by now.  I mean, it was Christmas, for Chrissakes...good to know those stickers are durable.<BR>
<BR>
OK, I gotta go now.  See you around.

<DD><b>-mere-:</b>  That's a total crack-up!  I put that sticker on myself back at Christmas!  I can't believe it's still there.<BR>
<BR>
Just for the record, the stickers are supposed to be stuck on things....k?<BR>
<BR>
