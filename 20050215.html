<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Nope, not right now.  Maybe over the summer?  I'm still working part-time down at Disneyland, and of course I'm auditioning like crazy, and I'm also tutoring a young actor in French (fun job), and Jeff's busy finishing a brand-new EP that's going to kick some serious <i>***</i>.  It's called "Space Patrol."  It's awesome.<br><br>Hi, <b>slayerdaddy!</b>  You know, the organizer raised a bunch of money that night, and donated it to the LASPC(it was all in cash), and he was just so thrilled with the results that I was a loser and didn't follow up to find out an address for you to donate.  I'm sorry!  =(<br><br>Hi, <b>Beldin!</b><br><br>Hello, <b>The Partyman!</b>  How goes it?  Happy V-day!<br><br>
