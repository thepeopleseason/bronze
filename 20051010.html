<dd>Hi, guys! <br><br>So, as you may know, I'm in a new movie with Shonda Farr ("April" the robot in <i>I Was Made To Love You</i>), and we're world-premiering at the Hollywood Film Festival on Oct. 22nd at 4pm!  I hope you'll come check it out if you're in the Southern California area! I play a hilarious character named "Jula Diva," and Velvet Chain is in the movie, as well. (I have my own band in the movie, and although some of the members are played by actors, Jeff Stacy's the bass player, and Jeff Mince is the drummer, and we play "Don't Leave A Diva" and "You Got Me" in the film.)<br><br>The film is called <a href="http://www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Couple of Days and Nights</a> and was written and directed by Vaughn Verdi.  In addition to the VC tracks, the movie also features 2 tracks by 70's and 80's supergroup, <b>Heart</b>.  (Actualy, one Heart track, and one original Nancy Wilson song.)<br><br>Go to the site to find out more, see pics from the movie, watch the trailer, etc.<br><a href="http://www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com</a><br><br>The movie stars me, <b>David Lago</b> (<I>7th Heaven, the Young and the Restless</i> - Emmy Winner), <b>Shonda Farr</b> (<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Jack & Bobby</i>), <b>Allison Munn</b> (<i>What I Like About You, Elizabethtown</i>), <b>Joseph Peracchio</b> (<i>Smack, Into the West</i>), <B>KW Miller</b> (<I>Wicked</I> - nat'l tour) and <b>Deirdre O'Connell</b> (<I>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</I>).<br><br>As I said, the film will be world-premiering at the <a href="http://www.hollywoodawards.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hollywood Film Festival</a> (at the Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood) on October 22 at 4pm.  I'm not 100% sure how much tickets cost yet, but we think that they'll be $10.  I do know you'll be able to buy them online through <a href="http://www.arclightcinemas.com/homepage.jsp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arclight</a> starting one week before the screening, so that's cool.  =)<br><br>Here's the movie synopsis:<br><br><b>A COUPLE OF DAYS AND NIGHTS</b><br><br>A love story brimming with comic irony as values clash over creativity, integrity and fame. <br><br>Jula (Erika Amato) is a sultry lead singer searching the crowd for two things; a boyfriend with a "Greek-Roman Profile", and anybody with "full-on signing power". Micah (David Lago) is a wannabe in love with BMW's, pink martinis, the fairer sex and the dream of being the next single-name success story. Scott (Joe Peracchio) is a trust fund baby whose inner voice is constipated from the constant pressure of an over-bearing family business. And at the heart of this pandemonium is Rhonda (Shonda Farr), the freak out of water trying to document it and follow her dreams in the face of all obstacles, especially herself.<br><br>These four artists are swimming in their desires to be understood, accepted and loved...but drowning in the overwhelming pressures of selling out in the highly commercial world of LA. A world where they learn that dreams can drive you, desire can destroy you, but love can find you in <i><b>A Couple of Days and Nights</b></i>.<br><br>Hope to see you at the premiere!  ;-)<br><br>
