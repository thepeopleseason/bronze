<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Well, there are Union pits and Non-union pits, Union pits making a lot more money, but of course you have to be member of the musician's union to work in a Union pit.  (When I did <i>Fiddler on the Roof</I>, that was an all-union pit, whereas <i>Sunday in the Park with George</i> was a mixed pit - both Union and Non-union.)  In LA, the musician's union is known as Local 47.  There are different designations all cross the country.  Local 235, Local 142, etc.  Anyway, I just mean that's he's working in professional, all-Union pit orchestras for various musicals in and around the SoCal area.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  lol...good luck with that! ;-)<br><br><b>kessie</b>  Cool!  I just got the add.  Thanks!<br><br><b>ShadowQuest</b>  Well, maybe that's because I'm the biggest nerd?  j/k<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b> You know what?  I don't even know what those guys are up to lately.  It's been so long since we got together...  Jeff and I really write everything on our own, primarily, although sometimes it gets further developed or embellished later on when the other guys get their hands on it, but right now it's just Jeff and me doing our thing.  As for Jeff, he's great.  Updated his system to use LIVE5 and stuff...he's really enjoying playing with his new studio toys.  And we're writing a new song together now that I'm back in town...  I do know that our keyboard player, Marc, is a chorister with the Opera Pacific again this season, and that Brian (guiatrist extraordinaire) has been doing a lot of union pit orchestra work for musicals and such.  (What is it with this band and musicals???  Jeff *hates* musicals!  lol)<br><br>

<dd><B>Beldin:</b>  Hey, there!  Yep, things have been going very well, thanks!  =)  How are you?<br><br>Hiya, <b>ShadowQuest!</b><br><br>Hey, if anyone's interested in reading some of our reviews from <b><i>42nd Street</i></b>, I posted them in a blog a while back.  <a href="http://erikaamato.broadwayworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erika's Blog</a>  I don't keep up with it very well, so don't expect much as far as blogs go, but our reviews are there.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  Hey!  ;-)  I know you're kidding, but when I said "diva" in this case, I mean "raging evil drama queen DIVA!"  (Oh, wait...maybe you weren't kidding??  hehehe)<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b> Nope, no clue.  But I'll be sure to tell you guys about it if and when that happens!<br><br>

<dd><b>Menomegirl:</b>  Thanks!  And yes, of course I'm very happy to be home.  And these shows I'm currently auditioning for are in the area, so I wouldn't have to leave again, which is nice.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Well, I have one gig lined up already, (my professional Christmas caroling gig), but that doesn't start until Thanksgiving (I'll have a few rehearsals before then, of course, but as far as actually performing).  And as I mentioned, I have a callback for something tomorrow, plus I have a few other auditions lined up, so we'll see.  =)<br><br>Oh!  And my movie, <a href="http://www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Couple of Days and Nights</a> is finally getting it's world-premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival at the Arclight Cinemas in October, so that'll be fun.<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  Oh, and I forgot to respond to the 2nd part of your query:  yes, I'm glad to be back, but I also miss the show quite a bit. I just auditioned for another show last night, and I have a callback for the female lead tomorrow, so we'll see.  (Keep your fingers crossed!)  =)<br><br>By the way, I don't know if any of you guys are into myspace.com, but we just put up a VC page there, and it doesn't suck.  ;-)  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thevelvetchain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/thevelvetchain</a>  Check it out!  (There are 4 free song downloads there.)<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  lol...What are you talking about?  I love SD!  (Really.  I think it's a great city.)  But yes, I had a wonderful time, thanks.  We got rave reviews, and I had an absolute blast playing the big diva of the show.  ;-)<br><br><b>Old One:</b>  Howdy doodie-doo!  (OK, it must be too early in the AM for me!)  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><i>*yawn*</i>  <br>Good morning.  =)  <br>I'm back in LA after my 3-month run doing <b><i>42nd Street</i></b> down in Escondido (San Diego County), and I thought I'd stop by and say howdy.  (Howdy!)<br><br>
