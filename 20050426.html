<dd><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  LOL!<br><b>OldManFan:</b>  Oh, that's a shame.  Well, it runs 6/9 all the way through 8/28, so if you feel like coming back in 4 months...  ;-)<br>Well, guys, I've gotta go.  Talk to you soon!<br><br>~E<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  That Swedish <i>Macbeth</i> sounds like quite a difficult shoot!  (To say the least. Sheesh!)  But you know what?  I'd do it.  In a heartbeat.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>DeAn:</b>  hehehe...  I'm already on it!  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1128550/" target="_blank">Erika's listing on imdb.com</a>  And here's my listing on BroadwayWorld.com <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/bios/viewstar.cfm?starid=396" target="_blank">Erika's Bio</a>  ;-)  And yes, getting paid to do what you love is amazing, and I feel very fortunate to be able to do it, as I'm sure you do, as well!  And thanks for the Viper Room tip...I may do that!  =)<br><br>

<dd><B>Beldin:</b>  You don't know <i>42nd Street</i>?  Well, it's a Broadway musical based on the 1933 movie of the same name.  It opened on B'way in 1980 starring Jerry Orbach and Tammy Grimes (in the role I'll be playing) when it won the Tony for Best Musical.  Then, there was a revival in 2001 starring Christine Ebersole (again in the role I'll be playing), and it won Tony's for Best Revival of a Musical and also Best Actress in a Musical.  It's a backstage musical.  Lots of dancing, particularly big tap numbers.  (But not from me!) My character's the big diva, who eventually breaks her ankle, which forces the young innocent chorus girl, Peggy Sawyer, to go on for her and save the show. The famous line, "You're gonna go out there a youngster and come back a star!" is from <i>42nd Street</i>.  Very cute stuff.<br><br>

<dd><b>DeAn:</b>  Great to hear things are going so well for you!  I put your new e-mail in our database, thanks.  And Ashfelt is an act, not a label.  We released the new EP on our own label, Freak Records, actually.  =)  We met them (Ashfelt) through the Iris Light/Karavena label that released "The Abduction of the Art of Noise" back on '03.  (We contributed a track to that CD, too.  "Beat Box, Diversion 2")  Anyway, things are great here, thanks.  Very busy.  Haven't had any kind of day-job since November of '01.  Been making my living through theater, indie films, the band, and recording gigs.  It's good.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>DeAn</b> Hey, you!  Long time, no hear from.  I'm not sure we even have a valid e-mail addy for you anymore.  =(  I think you would've really dug our last release, "Asteroid Belt."  Very cool stuff.  And we just put out a new EP with a UK act called Ashfelt.  (The CD's called "Space Patrol.")  Hope all is well!<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Beldin</b>!  Hmmmm....   You're right.  I'll be sure to watch my step, then.  ;-)<br><b>ShadowQuest</b>  And the same to you!<br><b>wolfguard:</b>  Good evening.  And how are you?<br><br>

<dd><b>valMichael</b>:  Well, I won't be anywhere except Escondido this summer, 'cause the show I'm doing keep me there from the end of May through the end of August.  Have fun at the party, though!<br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  It compares to nothing, really.  It's very unique.  Just check it out!  (We have samples on the site!)  <a href="http://www.lamusic.com/velvetchain/spacepatrolep.html" target="_blank">Space Patrol</a><br><br>
