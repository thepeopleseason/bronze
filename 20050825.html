<dd><b>GothicAvenger:</b>  Yes, Velvet Chain has done a few conventions, actually.  They've been really fun.  Our most recent one was the Vulkon Convention in Oakland last year.  =)  And I've gotten a kiss or two from the wonderful Mr. Head, myself.  Lovely experience, isn't it?  ;-)<br><br>Congrats on quitting smoking!  I know it's hard, but you can do it!<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>GothicAvenger</b>!  How are you?  Yeah, things are going super-well, thanks.  We opened back on June 9th, and it's been a great run.  A lot of work, but I'm just so grateful to be a working actor, I'm definitely not gonna complain, you know?  =)  As I mentioned, we close this Sunday, which will make 93 performances, total.  I'm gonna miss it!<br><br>And yes, Mom, I've been getting enough rest, I promise.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys!  I know I haven't been here in ages, but I have a (fairly) good excuse.  ;-)  I've been super-swamped doing 8 shows a week of the musical <i><b>42nd Street</b></i> down here in Escondido, plus the wireless connection here at the hotel has been extremely wonky, so it's been hit-or-miss for me getting online.  But we're closing in a few days, and my laptop seems to be getting online like a dream now, so I wanted to drop in and say hi!  <b>HI!</b><br><br>
