<dd>Well, I guess I should get going...  I have a long day tomorrow.  The <i>Snow White</i> show at Disneyland is closing tomorrow, (I played the Evil Queen and the Hag off and on for the past year and a half), so I'm going down there, bringing a few friends, saying goodbye, and then there's a cast party in the evening.<br><br>Anyway, I hope everyone has a great day off tomorrow!<br><br>xoxo<br>Erika<br><a href="http://www.myspace.com/velvetchain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Velvet Chain on MySpace</a><br><br>ETA:  I was on the season premiere of the final season.  It was a two-hour special, which has now been broken up into two distinct episodes.  I played a KGB official (Lt. Anna  Guri), and I'm at the end of the first one and the beginning of the second!  ;-)  It's called <i>Lee Harvey Oswald</i>.  (Parts 1 and 2 - not the original title, by the way!)  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>:  Yep, I do.  It's not great, though, so I'm accumulating more stuff to cull together a new one.  My old one has my appearances on <i>Quantum Leap</i>, a failed sitcom called <i>Bring Up Jack</i>, a weird special on Vh1 called <i>Sparkle Lounge</i>, my win on <i>Win Ben Stein's Money</i>, a clip from VC's appearance on <i>BtVS</i>, and some stuff from a couple of indie films I did.  But it's kind of out-of date (I mean, QL was over 10 years ago), and I don't really like the quality, so again, that's why I'm trying to put together a new one.  As soon as I get a copy of the latest movie I did - <i><a href="http://www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Couple of Days and Nights</a></i> - I'll start working on it.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>:  It depends.  There are a lot of open calls for theater, which I atttend quite often, but I also get asked to audition.  (I get submitted by my agent, and then I get a specific appointment time, which is nice, since in that case you already know the casting director is interested in you, meaning you've cleared at least one hurdle.)  For film and TV, you always, ALWAYS need an audition appointment.  (No open calls.)  I actually have an audition for a short film on Tuesday...  Of course, it's a "deferred pay" situation.  Meaning, I don't get paid unless it gets sold or something.  See, my film/TV agent quit the business several months ago, and I haven't been able to find a new one yet, so the only auditions I can get (in film or TV) are ones that are posted in the trades, that I can submit myself for.  And those are going to be student films and the like.  Which is fine, 'cause the exposure is always good, plus getting more material for your reel.<br><br>To be clear:  I have an agent who represents me exclusively for theater.  I no longer have one for TV/Film, although I'm hoping that won't be a permanent situation.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>valMichael:</b>   Hey, there!  Well, sure...I've got a few auditions lined up, and I'm still waiting to hear about a show I had a callback for yesterday... I don't think I'm gonna get that one, though...I think the part will go to a non-union performer.  I.e, cheaper.  :-P  Anyway, I've got my Christmas caroling gig to look forward to (good money, I'll be very busy during December), but as of now, I'm pretty free until then.<br><br>Hi, <b>slayerdaddy!</b>  Well, they said they're be calling tomorrow.  See above for my gut feeling on that subject.<br><br>
