<dd>BW:  How the heck do you know that?  I just asked Drew to co-write 20 with me today.  Spies everywhere.<br><br>Princess:  Yes, I should really do that.   But you know I've been too busy with the, uh, sucking.<br><br>Allyson:  Totally fell for it.  I'm such a sucker.<br><br><br>Okay, this kid needs his sleep.  Episode was due today, and we haven't started writing yet.  Hey, what do you want from us?!  We're cancelled!  Seriously, enjoy the shows while they last.  It's a golden era in television, soon to be lost under the drifting sands of reality programs and instant repeats.  But we'll always have the Bronze...<br><br>*poof, I say, poof*<br><br>Steve DeKnight<br><br>

<dd>Allyson:  Whoa whoa whoa!  Don't give it to everybody.  My yahoo wouldn't be able to take it.  Just shoot it over to the people I mentioned, which tonight is singsinthecar and bubonic.  If I ever get a bigger account, I'll open it up to the masses.<br><br>

<dd>Bubonic: Send `em along.<br><br>Singsinthecar:  Okay, Allyson, peel her off my e-mail too.  But only if she promises to e-mail me some more art.<br><br>Allyson:  Isn't he the greatest?  Serious man love for that boy.  <br><br>Okay, one more round then this kid needs some sleep - before I start my last Angel script.  Yes, that's right, I get to pen one more.  Oh, and did I mention Drew Goddard's writing it with me?    There.  I mentioned it.<br><br>

<dd>Undeadenglishpatient:  All right!  You caught me!  Joss wrote the perspective line!  WHY MUST HE TAKE EVERYTHING GOOD IN MY WORLD?!  Oh, wait - he actually gives me everything good.  Sorry.  My bad.<br><br>

<dd>Aria:  Laughed long and hard over the hair gel bit.  Truly inspired.  As for the Angel TV movies, it all depends on our talented cast and crew's schedules.  But I do know that I, for one, would love to write and direct an Angel movie.  How freaking cool would that be?<br><br>

<dd>Bubonic!:  Hey, I was wondering if I'd ever bump into you here.  Send me that picture we took together.  Allyson has my e-mail.  And did anyone notice how mamma yamma Allyson looked at the party?  Not me of course, cause mere knows kung fu.  But Drew noticed.  He told me when he was touching my butt.<br><br>

<dd>Princess!:  I sooooo owe you an e-mail.  I suck, but only because I've been really, really... sucking.  And hey!  School is great!  Spent seven years there myself (after high school.  As far as any of you know).<br><br>Malista:  Thanks so much.  And again, the amazing Mr. Whedon had a lot to do with it.  And for the final answer:  Joss and I wrote the scene on the plane together and he directed it.  Very well.  *******.<br><br>

<dd>Arabchick:  Chappelle's show!  I love it.  If you guys haven't seen his Rick James stuff, go check it out on Comedy Central's website.  Had me in tears (the good, non-Jossverse kind).  And whohah!  I'd love to work on Wonderfalls.  It was my favorite pilot last year.  Everybody watch it so Fox doesn't can it before I talk my way in.<br><br>

<dd>Allyson:  Close.  Joss actually suggested the whole montage.  I wrote and directed all the stuff leading up to the heartbreak scene where Fred drives away.  That was Joss (but not one included in my question).<br><br>Undeadenglishpatient: Partially right:  Joss and I wrote the final Illyria/Wes scene and I did have the immense pleasure of directing it.<br><br>BW:  You are very wise.  Joss did write and direct the opening two scenes in the apartment.  <br><br>Thoin:  Damn.  You caught me.<br><br>

<dd>Halfrek:  Rick Springfield is a favorite singer from my youth, a long time ago.  I'll be dead soon.  Say nice things while you can.<br><br>Allyson:  Thanks.  Loved the way the montage turned out.  Joss picked the perfect song.  *******.<br><br>Thatspoetic:  Hug hug.  Now get daddy a highball.  I'm thirsty (as always, for those of you that witnessed my debacle at the party).<br><br>Captain tightpants:  Titles?!  You're worried about titles?!  "I'm Out of a Freaking Job!"  How's that for a title?!   PS.:  Why are your pants tight?  And where's my highball?<br><br>

<dd>Magista:  Steve DeKnight's Army of Doom.  Hmm... Has a nice ring to it.<br><br>Singsinthecar: we both need to come here more often.  Shame on us!  (Mostly you, `cause hey - I got an army of Doom.<br><br><br>I'd like to take a moment to thank the man who gave me the big shot - and was instrumental in shaping, writing, and directing this episode.  No, not that rat ******* Goddard.  I'm talking about the big man himself, Joss Whedon.  He is truly The Man.  And for you real fans, here's a little mystery for you:  Joss wrote and directed two key scenes in this episode.  One other scene we wrote together and he directed.  And one scene we wrote together and I directed.  Name those scenes, baby!<br><br>

<dd>Dachelle:  I'll wash up.  Promise.  <br><br>Many Kudos to my fine cast and crew who made "Shells" one of the best professional experiences of my life.  Extra special thanks to the amazing Amy Acker.  I, too, worship you.<br><br>
