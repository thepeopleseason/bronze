<dd>You know, I was gonna come here and hang out for a while since the rest of the gang is either away writing, acting, directing, or talking to reporters... and then just as I post Joss shows up in the office and wants to talk about the rest of the season.<br><br>What's there to talk about?  Angel broods, Fred says some run-on sentences, Gunn mixes street lingo with lawyer-speak, Wes kills somebody, Spike says something that causes half the fans to write letters to the office telling us how much they hate Fury, and Lorne mentions some B-level celebrity.<br><br>It practically writes itself.  I don't see what there is to talk about.<br><br>

<dd>My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.  <br><br>And they're like, "it's better than yours."<br><br>Damn right, it's better than yours.<br><br>I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.<br><br>
