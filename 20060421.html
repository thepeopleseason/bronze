<dd>Hello, you magnificent Bronzers!  Long time no talk!  What can I say?  That Superman crap keeps me busy.  Anyway, I was doing a DVD commentary with James Marsters for one of my episodes of Smallville and it got me all nostalgic for the good `ol Pantsless Fridays.  Okay, so it's Thursday.  Sue me.<br><br>I also wanted to let everyone know that I've set up a myspace account to try to keep in touch with all the fans of Buffy, Angel, and Smallville.  Kind of a one-stop DeKnight emporium, since I often don't have enough time to visit all the different forums.  Plus you can see pics of my shaved head, my lovely fiancée, and Foxy Bear.  What's a Foxy Bear?  Drop on in and find out:<br><br>http://www.myspace.com/stevendeknight<br><br>All right, I'm putting my pants back on. I'd love to hang out for a while, but my fiancée has me doing this aerial fitness class.  Trapeze and stuff.  Probably break my freaking neck.<br><br>Love you guys,<br>DeKnight<br><br>PS:  I have no idea how to work those special VIP colors anymore.  So just imagine I'm a pretty green!<br><br>
