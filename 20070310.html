<dd>OK, I have to go, or I'll be late.  If anyone's still here tonight, I'll try posting again then.<br><br>Bye!<br><br>P.S.  OH!  If anyone in the SoCal area is interested in my latest show (the new GrooveLily musical, "Sleeping Beauty Wakes," performed by both deaf and hearing actors) it's already 75% sold through the entire run, so I'd try to get tickets early.<br><br>Here's the link to get tickets:<br><a href="http://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/productiondetail.aspx?id=518" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleeping Beauty Wakes</a><br><br>And here's some info:<br><br>Center Theatre Group present this co-production with Deaf West Theatre, which starts March 31 and opens April 7 at the Kirk Douglas Theatre. Jeff Calhoun (<i>Bells Are Ringing, Grease, Brooklyn</i>)  who similarly staged <i>Big River</i>  will direct and choreograph the new musical slated to run through May 13.<br><br>Featuring a book by Tony Award winner Rachel Sheinkin (<i>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</i>) and music by Brendan Milburn and Valerie Vigoda  of the band GrooveLily  <i>Sleeping Beauty Wakes</i> reunites the trio who penned <i>Striking 12</i> (a holiday show based on "Little Match Girl" by Hans Christian Andersen) and <i>Wheelhouse</i> (the autobiographical tale set on GrooveLily's touring motor home).<br><br>The cast includes Erika Amato, Deanne Bray, Clinton Derricks-Carroll, Kevin Earley, Shannon Ford, Russell Harvard, Troy Kotsur, Christia Mantzke and Alexandria Wailes with creators Brendan Milburn and Valerie Vigoda also taking part.<br><br>A new twist on the classic Grimms fairy tale will takes audiences "on a wildly theatrical journey set in parallel worlds: a fairy tale kingdom and a contemporary sleep-disorder clinic," an announcement explains. "In both worlds, a caring father learns the difference between protecting and smothering his beloved daughter while his daughter discovers the real costs of flirting with danger, the joy of living a fully conscious and conscientious life, and the meaning of true love."<br><br>The design team for <i>Sleeping Beauty Wakes</i> features Tobin Ost (scenic), Maggie Morgan (costumes) and Michael Gilliam (lighting). The production stage manager is William Coiner.<br><br>CTG and Deaf West Theatre Company previously teamed on the 2002 presentation of Deaf West's <i>Big River</i>, which incorporated hearing and deaf actors singing and signing songs of the musical, at the Mark Taper Forum. The show moved to Broadway where it earned Tony Award Honors for Excellence and returned to Los Angeles on a national tour.<br><br>Tickets for <i>Sleeping Beauty Wakes</i> at The Kirk Douglas Theatre, 9820 Washington Blvd. in Culver City, CA, can be purchased by calling CTG Audience Services at (213) 628-2772 or online at CenterTheatreGroup.org. For the deaf community call TDD (213) 680-4017.<br><br>
