<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Revival.  <i>Charley's Aunt</i>, the turn-of-the-century farce.  Right up my alley.  =)  (If you know the play, I'm called back for "Kitty Verdun.")<br><br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Well, let's hope I am!  :-P<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  Hey, there!  Yay, choir practice!  =)  Nope, didn't go through this yet.  Everything's been going great, thanks.  Got called back for everything I auditioned for, with the execption of the only non-paying gig in the bunch (an indie pilot presentation).  Funny, that.  ;-)  I'm still waiting to hear on a couple of things...  And I have another callback on Monday, which I'm quite looking forward to, as it's for a straight play.  (I do so many musicals...it would be a nice change.)  Thanks for asking!  =)<br><br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  LOL...you're so cute!  And thanks!<br><br>

<dd><b>valMichael:</b>  Well, I've met her a few times, and she was always very nice to me, but I wouldn't go so far to say I know her.  My friend Vaughn, though, knows her really well.  They're friends.  =)  And yeah, she and Ann are both so ridiculously talented.  We're so excited that they agreed to let us use one of their songs inthe movie!<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Well, it's more like one degree of separation - Cameron and Nancy have apparently told Vaughn they'll come to the screening - but who knows?  They may get too busy, and be unable to come...<br><br>ETA:  <b>Holy Water:</b>  LOL  Sorry!  I have met her a few times, and have most certainly been in the same room.  :-P<br><br>

<dd>Thanks, <b>Christopher Marlowe</b>!  It's actually a pretty big deal.  We're trying to promote the heck out of it, and get industry people there, etc.  We want to sell this thing, you know?  =)<br><br>Fortunately, Nancy Wilson (of Heart - who has contributed the track for the opening credits) is Cameron Crowe's wife, and they're  good friends with <i>our</i> director, Vaughn Verdi, and Allison Munn (who's one of the costars of our movie) just did <i>Elizabethtown</i> with Cameron (and Orlando Bloom), so hopefully we can get some cool people there.  =)<br><br>ETA:  Greetings, <b>wolfguard</b>!  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>DaddyCatALSO</b>:  Well, we shot this movie almost two years ago, but it's been in post the entire time since then, and this is its world-premiere.  It's never, ever been shown to the public before.  And now it's a finalist at the Hollywood Film Festival...it's all very exciting!  And so, to answer your question, this is the only time I've ever worked with Shonda.  =)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys -<br><br>So, yep, I'm in a movie.  I am starring as "Jula Diva" in a new indie feature film called <a href="http://www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Couple Of Days And Nights</a>.  <b>Velvet Chain</b>'s music is also used extensively in the movie, which also features tracks by 70's and 80's supergroup, <b>Heart</b>.  And, as an added bonus, the fabulous Jeff Stacy makes his (non-speaking) film debut!  ;-)<br><br>The movie stars me, <b>David Lago</b> (<I>7th Heaven, the Young and the Restless</i> - Emmy Winner), <b>Shonda Farr</b> (<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Jack & Bobby</i>), <b>Allison Munn</b> (<i>What I Like About You, Elizabethtown</i>), <b>Joseph Peracchio</b> (<i>Smack, Into the West</i>), <B>KW Miller</b> (<I>Wicked</I> - nat'l tour) and <b>Deirdre O'Connell</b> (<I>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</I>).<br><br>The film will have its world-premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival (at the Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood) on October 22 at 4pm.  =)  I don't know how much tickets are yet, but I'm guessing in the $10 range.  AND, I know you'll be able to purchase tickets online through the Arclight, so that's cool.<br><br>Here's the movie synopsis:<br><br><b>A COUPLE OF DAYS AND NIGHTS</b><br><br>A love story brimming with comic irony as values clash over creativity, integrity and fame. <br><br>Jula is a sultry lead singer searching the crowd for two things; a boyfriend with a "Greek-Roman Profile", and anybody with "full-on signing power". Micah is a wannabe in love with BMW's, pink martinis, the fairer sex and the dream of being the next single-name success story. Scott is a trust fund baby whose inner voice is constipated from the constant pressure of an over-bearing family business. And at the heart of this pandemonium is Rhonda, the freak out of water trying to document it and follow her dreams in the face of all obstacles, especially herself.<br><br>These four artists are swimming in their desires to be understood, accepted and loved...but drowning in the overwhelming pressures of selling out in the highly commercial world of LA. A world where they learn that dreams can drive you, desire can destroy you, but love can find you in <i><b>A Couple of Days and Nights</b></i>.<br><br>Hope to see you at the premiere!  ;-)<br><br>~Erika<br>P.S.  There'a a very cool trailer for the movie at the official website.  Or, just click here:  <a href="http://www.acoupleofdaysandnights.com/trailer.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Movie Trailer</a><br><br>
