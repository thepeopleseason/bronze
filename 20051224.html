<dd><b>ShadwoQuest:</b>  No offense taken.  Our prices are pretty cheap, though.  $10 to $12 in general.  Anyway, as for the links, our webmaster switched severs recently, so if you had our site bookmarked, all those addy's are now defunct.  (The ones that had lama.com and lamusic.com extensions) You need to start fresh with http://www.velvetchain.com  =)<br><br><b>Icelord:</b>  Merry Christmas!  No, I'm not in a show right now.  Just caroling, caroling (now we go,  Christmas bells are ringing...).<br><br>OK, really gone now.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Gothic Avenger!</b><br><br><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  Well, yay!  I'm so glad you were able to listen to some of our stuff.  You know, you can order any and all of our albums directly from us at our website:  <a href="http://www.velvetchain.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.velvetchain.com</a>  We ship worldwide.  =)<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Actually, no.  I've received two different invitations for New Year's Day parties, but nothing for New Year's Eve.  I think Jeff and I may be mellow this year and just go out to dinner.<br><br>

<dd>Good evening, <b>wolfguard</b>.  =)<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>  It's called <i>Menorah, Menorah</i> and it's a beautiful ballad, with gorgeous harmonies, mostly in minor keys.  I'm not sure who composed it...  Here are the lyrics:<br><br>Menorah, Menorah shine into the night<br>And brighten the world with your Hannukah light<br>Proclaim to all people who happen to see<br>Your symbol of faith, and the right to be free<br>Menorah, Menorah each taper you hold<br>Shouts out the story, the glory of old<br>Rekindling our faith with your own special glow<br>Like the lamp in the temple did long, long ago<br>Rekindling our faith<br>With your own special glow<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>OldManFan</b>!<br><br><b>VampSlayer:</b>  LOL!  Is that a real song?  I've never heard it, but if it's real, I'd love to check it out!  =) <br><br>This pic's not quite as cute ('cause it's an action shot of us singing Happy Birthday to someone, and no-one looks good with their mouth open) but it's in color (as opposed to that b&w one I colorized in Photoshop). <br><br><a href="http://img378.imageshack.us/img378/2990/caroling052colorfix6qp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Caroling Action Shot</a><br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Actually, I'm still singing them.  It's my job this time of year.  (I've done 26 gigs so far, and I have two to go!)  We have a repertoire of over 65 memorized songs, from traditionals like <i>Adeste Fideles, Here We Come A-Caroling</i> and <i>Ding Dong Merrily On High</i> to jazz arrangements of <i>White Christmas, Merry Christmas Darling, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,</i> etc.  We also do more generic wintery songs like <i>Baby It's Cold Outside, Sleigh Ride, Winter Wonderland, My Favorite Things,</i> etc.  And we have one truly gorgeous Hannukah song.  =)<br><br><b>valMichael:</b>  Why, thank you!<br><br>
