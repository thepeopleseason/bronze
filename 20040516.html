<dd><b>Dogmeat:</b>  Oh!  Well, great!  And - <i>*blush*</i> - thanks for the compliment!<br><br><b>Menomegirl:</b>  Too true!  I really enjoy my rare days off.  But I have to say, I am very grateul to be working so much!  =)<br><br><b>Thoin:</b>  LOL...thinking of me while driving with a student driver, eh?  That's pretty funny!<br><br><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Hey, you!  so nice to see you! <br><br><b>GothicAvenger:</b>  That's a very tough question, particularly when talking to someone who claims to have no musical talent...  My suggestion would be to buy a mini-casette recorder, and keep it with you all the time, so if you ever get a melody in your head, you can at least hum it into the recorder, and not lose the idea.  (Since I assume you don't play an instrument?)  Just let your mind be free, and see what sort of music might come into your head.  However, if you truly have no musical talent, I doubt you're going have that many melodic ideas, let alone be able to write any songs.  In which case, you should hook up with someone who does, and they'll write music to go with your lyrics.  Think Elton John and Bernie Taupin.  Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  Rodgers and Hammerstein.  Giblert & Sullivan...  You get where I'm going.  =)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Thoin</b>!<br><br>Well, I have rehearsal, so I won't be able to watch it.  But I'm going to try to remember to tape it!<br><br>As for what I'm packing...  Um...   I kind of don't get the reference, but I guess I could be packing a bazooka.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>Menomegirl:</b>  Hello!  Well, I've been super busy.  Been auditioning just about every day for one project or another, plus I'm in rehearsals for a play (Moliere's <i>The Bungler</i>) that opens on June 4th, plus I also got cast as the "Evil Queen" in the big spectacular, <i>Snow White - An Enchanting New Musical</i> down at Disneyland.  I start rehearsals for <i>that</i> on May 29th, so I'm going to be pulling double duty, doing both shows for a while.  So, like I said, I'm busy.  But happy!!  =)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Dogmeat</b> -<br>I'm just hanging out, sort of watching <i>L&O:SVU</i>.  I didn't have rehearsal tonight (for once!), so I just thought I'd use the time to rest.  (BTW, have we met?  If not, nice to meet you!)<br><br>
