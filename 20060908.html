<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  Thanks so much!  Actually, the html was coded through the use of the Dreamweaver program.  Are you familiar with it?  It's a great program.  I also did some of the code by hand.  And built all the jpeg's, etc.  =)<br><br>

<dd>Greetings, <b>wolfguard</b>.<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>:  If I could dance!  hehehe  I think that's why I love the dancing shows so much...since it's not a talent I really have (altough I've been a dance afficianado since I was a little girl).  <br><br><b>Dianne:</b>  =)<br><br>

<dd>Hi there, <b>Ebdim9th</b>!<br><br><b>Dianne:</b>   Nope, I actually can't stand most singing-oriented talent shows.  However, I was ADDICTED to <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i>!<br><br><b>RedCrayon:</b>  In two weeks, huh?  Depends how long you'll be here.  I have a show opening on the 29th, and I think there's a preview on the 28th...  But you'll probably be gone by then, huh?<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  No worries.  It may take a bit longer, then, as I only get down to check that mailbox about once a week or so.  Just FYI.  =)<br><br><b>ChristopherMarlowe:</b>  Actually, I didn't.  The music is all primarily backing tracks I found and puchased that were available for just this sort of purpose.  (So, I suppose whomever chose the musicians originally should get the real credit!)  I sweetened the tracks a little bit during the mixing process, but really my most important contribution was in choosing the best tracks I could find and having relatively good taste.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>  Got it.  Just waiting for the order to come through.  =)<br><br><b>valMichael:</b>  It's a combination of hired studio guys and synthesizers. I didn't have a "band" on this one.  I'm so glad you like it!<br><br>
