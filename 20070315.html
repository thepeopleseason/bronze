<dd>Gahhh!  This five minute rule is for the birds.  :)<br><br>While I was writing my post, those others came up.<br><br>Beldin, thanks for asking about Jenna.  The series is, at least for the moment, over.  The tenth book was THROAT CULTURE, which I think means you got half way.  Lots of other stuff out there, though.  I've been busy in my time away from Buffy.<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br>Night.<br><br>

<dd>Carita, let's not worry about colors and such.  I'm just dropping by to say hi.  My VIP time is ancient history.  :)  Though I find I did kind of miss the Bronze.<br><br>Christopher Marlowe: Thanks for the vote of confidence.<br><br>And on that note, the long, slow drive-by ends.  I'm wiped.  Btw, like the rest of you, I can't wait for season 8 to start.  I hope Joss does ten more seasons in the comics.<br><br>Adios.<br><br>

<dd>Beldin, thanks.  Good to see you, and some other familiar names as well.  It's been a long time.  :)<br><br>

<dd>Hollyn, they're in middle school, and we're doing OLIVER!  It could be a disaster, but with just a few rehearsals under our belts, I'm pretty impressed with the kids.<br><br>
