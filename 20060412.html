<dd>Hi, guys - Posting for a good cause.   =)<br><br>So, as I've mentioned before, I've decided to participate in the <b>Revlon 5K Run/Walk for Women</b> in support of and solidarity with a friend from my theater company who is a breast cancer survivor. This is a wonderful event held every year in both NY and LA to raise funds for women's cancer research.<br><br>The LA walk will be held downtown on May 13th. (Come on down and cheer us on, if you're in the neighborhood!)<br><br>I'm really excited about this, as it's my first ever organized 5K event. (I participated in the AIDS Dance-a-thon for years, but I've never done any kind of run/walk before!) =)<br><br>I've set a personal fundraising goal of $1,000. It would mean so much to me if you would donate any amount you can afford (even $5.00 would be great) to help support the cause! Donations from anywhere in the world are gratefully accepted.<br><br>Here's the link to my personal fundraising page:<br><br><a href="https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=29806" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erika's Revlon Run/Walk Fundraising Page</a><br><br>Or, if for some reason that doesn't work, here's the URL for you to cut and paste:<br>https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=298069<br><br>Thank you so much for reading this, and for helping in the fight against women's cancers!<br><br>Peace,<br>Erika<br>P.S. Please feel pass this info on to anyone who might be interested!<br><br>
