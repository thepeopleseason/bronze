<dd>Well, gotta run...  Have a great evening, folks!  =)<br><br><b>Zeus:</b>  Sounds good!  Word of warning, though:  if you plan on coming on a Friday, allow at least twice as long, more like two-and-a-half times as long to get there as you would normally need.  For example, it should take me 45 minutes to get there without traffic, so on Fridays I allow 2 hours.  Just warnin' ya.  =)<br><br>Hope you can make it!<br><br>~E.<br>ETA:  Hi and Bye to <b>Beldin!</b>  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>slayerdaddy:</b>  Why, hello!  The show is going quite well, thanks!  I'm having a marvelous time.  =)<br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>:  Yes, I did!  I got to see them (albeit brifely, as I was quite tired), after the show, by one of the stage doors.  =)  They seemed to like the show, and OldManFan got a couple of pictures of me in my horrible post-show wig-cap hair!  (Way worse than hat-head, let me assure you!)  I wonder if he's planning on blackmailing me??<br><b>wolfguard:</b>  =)<br><br>
