<dd><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  Awwwwwwwwwww...  I'm glad you think I'm worth it!  :-)<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b> Fantastic!  I hope your finances improve mostly because I know what that's like (ick) and don't wish poor finances on anyone, but <I>yay</i> if you can buy a CD! <br><br><b>ACOLYTE:</b>  Oh, well, thank you!  It was a labor of love, really.<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  Ah...  Well, as I warned you when you told me you'd have to write check, that particular method of payment would mean a longer wait to receive your order, since I only go check that mailbox about once a week or so.  I went down and checked it on Tuesday the 12th, and your order wasn't there yet.  :-P  I'll be sure to go check again by the end of this week, and I'll send your CD ASAP.  =)<br><br><b>Beldin:</b>  Thanks so much!!<br><br>

<dd>Hey, guys!  How is everybody today?<br><br>So, Velvet Chain is being featured on a new podcast called "8 Plays A Week," and if we can get the most votes and stay in the top spot for 3 weeks running, we'll get an entire podcast devoted to us and our music! (Which translates into more exposure, which is always a good thing, right?) =)<br><br>We won week number one (thank you to everyone who already clicked), so please keep clicking on our song if you have a minute.<br><br>Just go here: <a href="http://www.yakkyakk.com/8playsaweek.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.yakkyakk.com/8playsaweek.html<br></a><br><br>Click on "Sea Of Tranquility." Every single listen counts as a vote, so feel free to click multiple times. ;-)<br><br>Thanks so much!<br><br>
