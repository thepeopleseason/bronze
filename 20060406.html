<dd><b>RedCrayon</b>  Of course I missed you guys!  =)  But, to be honest, I also came back to ask people to sponsor me in the Revlon 5K Run/Walk for Women.  As for Disneyland, sadly, the show will be closed for good by the time you get here.  (It's closing the first week of September.)  Sorry!<br><br><b>ShadowQuest</b>:  Well, that's a good question. It can vary.  But for a convention or other out-of-town gig, we usually have 5 band members.<br><br><a href="https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=298069" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click Here to sponsor Erika in the Revlon 5K Run/Walk for Women</a><br><br>

<dd>OK, guys, so I had this really long post that just got completely eaten 'cause my computer froze when I hit "Submit Post."  AAARGH!!!<br><br>So, to be brief:<br><br>Basically, yes, I am going back to Disneyland for the summer, and I've been very busy so far this year, which is great.  I've been cast in 3 different projects with Alan Menken (he of <i>The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast</i>, and <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i> fame, among others), so I've taken to calling 2006 my "Year of Menken." :-P  They were:  playing the Snow Queen in a workshop of a new musical of <i>The Snow Queen</i>, singing (recording gig) for a new Disney feature called <i>Enchanted,</i> and playing a disco diva and a nun in the new musical version of <i>Sister Act.</i>  I shot an indie short film last month called <i>Mission Romance</i> where I played a paramedic, and I performed (sang) in a benefit concert of Kander & Ebb's <i>And The World Goes 'Round</i> for my theater company (6 performances, total). <br><br>It's been a good year so far.<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan</b>: Awww...too bad you'll miss it!  As for performing, I'm going to be doing the workshop for the new musical version of SISTER ACT (music by Alan Menken) at the Pasadena Playhouse while you're here, but I don't think the performances will be open to the public.  =(  Then, it's back to scaring little children at Disneyland for the summer.  ;-)<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>:  Would you believe I've never been to Canada?  So Calgary seem exotic enough to me!  ;-)<br><br><b>Glow Boy:</b>  Thank you so much!  I just wanted to do my part.<br><br>Hi back again to <b>MENSAgirl (a.k.a. notsoShyGirl)</b>!<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Ooooooooooooooooooh...  Sounds like fun!  East or West?<br><br><b>k8cre8:</b>  Things go very well, thank you!  Lots of exciting stuff going on, acting-wise, and some very cool new VC tunes in the works.  However, rather than going into a big long discussion of all that me-me-me performance sort of stuff, I'd rather take this opporunity to ask for your guys' help.  =)  <br><br><i>(Here comes the segue...)</i><br><br>So, in support of and solidarity with a friend from my theater company who is a breast cancer survivor, I have decided to participate in the <b>Revlon 5K Run/Walk for Women</b>, a wonderful event held every year in both NY and LA to raise funds for women's cancer research.<br><br>The LA walk will be held downtown on May 13th. (Come down and cheer us on, if you're in the neighborhood!)<br><br>I'm really excited about this, as it's my first ever organized 5K event. (I participated in the AIDS Dance-a-thon for years, but I've never done any kind of run/walk before!) =)<br><br>I've set a personal fundraising goal of $1,000. It would mean so much to me if you would donate any amount you can afford (even $5.00 would be great) to help support the cause!<br><br>Here's the link to my personal fundraising page:<br><br><a href="https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=298069" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erika's Revlon Run/Walk Fundraising Page</a><br><br>Or, if for some reason that doesn't work, here's the URL for you to cut and paste:<br>https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=298069<br><br>So, if you feel like sponsoring me for this event, I would be really, really grateful!<br><br>Thus endeth the PSA for today...  =)<br><br>
