<dd>Christopher Marlowe - I do know a lot of good submarine movies.   Funny you should ask.  I'd have to say Das Boot is my favorite.  I love those German men.  Let me say that again, just to be clear: I love German men.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.<br><br>Wolfgod - you know what's happening in episode 13?  Crap.  This new system of keeping things a secret by posting script pages on the internet just isn't working out for us.  Maybe it's time to try something new.<br><br>Uh oh.  I have to go work for a little while.  Back in a bit.<br><br>

<dd>Okay, so since we know you've all been sitting around wondering what House each member of the writing staff would be in if he/she were to attend Hogwarts, we went ahead and compiled that data.  Just for you, our beloved fans:<br><br>Joss - Gryffindor<br>Jeff - Gryffindor<br>Fury - Hufflepuff<br>Ben - Ravenclaw<br>Liz - Ravenclaw<br>Sarah - Ravenclaw<br>Steve - Slytherin<br>Drew - Slytherin<br><br>At first, the Sorting Hat thought Steve might belong in Hufflepuff, but ultimately it decided on Slytherin for him.  And apparently I've got Malfoy lineage in me or something, because I didn't even get to sit down before I heard "Slytherin."  Which is fine with me - Gryffindor are a bunch of shinefaced wizards' pets.  I hope they rot.<br><br>

<dd>First of all, let me just rant for a second.  No new Angel until January?  What the hell are we paying you people for!<br><br>(Did you guys like the end of Destiny?  I thought that was pretty cool myself.  When I saw the first rough cut of that episode I jumped out of my seat and kissed Fury right on the mouth.)<br><br>

<dd>Hi, Chris Buchanan here from Mutant Enemy. Long time lurker, first time poster. <br><br>Thought it was about time (OK, it's way past time), to give all of the ANGEL fans an enormous shout out/thank you directly from Joss and all of us at Mutant Enemy.<br><br>Your kind words, support and efforts (flowers, beanie babies, postcards, mobile billboards, adverts, etc., etc.) in the weeks since the cancellation of ANGEL was announced, have been darn near overwhelming.  We really, really appreciate the love.  <br><br>It goes without saying here at the Bronze Beta, but I also wanted to let you all know that the Buffy/Angel-verse will never die.<br><br>While we consider the possibility of Season 6 of ANGEL as remote as the discovery of WMDs in Iraq, Mutant Enemy already has plans for more tales from the world of ANGEL. I can't comment on exactly what form they'll take, but rest assured, it's in the works.<br><br>Thanks again to all of the fans, the "Save Angel" organizations, and your efforts taken in our behalf.<br><br>You kids are the best!<br><br>Buchanan<br><br>
