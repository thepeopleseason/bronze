<dd>Not to put too fine a point on it, but in <br>publishing, we have ratings, too.  If the <br>sales for B/A  books decrease, they'll <br>stop publishing them.   So the editors <br>are crossing their fingers.  They're <br>fans, too.<br><br>I gotta go to bed.  I'd love to stay up all <br>night--I'm pretty sad--but I have a first-<br>grader who starts school at 7:45.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>

<dd>I was approached by an editor at <br>Random House, who knew my work as <br>a horror writer.  She said she was <br>bidding on the rights to "a new show <br>that's on at 8 o'clock" and asked me if I <br>was interested.  I knew immediately <br>that it was Buffy, which had aired about <br>2 weeks earlier.  I said of course.  I <br>called Christopher Golden and we <br>decided to present ourselves as a <br>team.  RH didn't bid high enough, but <br>thank goodness Simon and Schuster <br>did.  We found out who the editor was <br>and got in touch immediately.  We <br>faxed her some ideas and got a <br>contract within 24 hours.  Then we <br>wrote Halloween Rain, which was the <br>first original Buffy novel, in 3 and a half <br>weeks.  Including reading scripts.  But <br>we did it.  And I have been working for <br>S&S on Buffy and Angel ever since. <br><br>I have interviewed almost all the <br>actors, and my coauthors have <br>interviewed the ones I haven't, with the <br>exception of SMG, and maybe Eliza <br>Dushku.  I'm so tired I can't remember.  <br>But I have some wonderful pix of me <br>vamping it up with ED at a PBP.  I've <br>also interviewed the crew and staff.  I <br>loved the crew.  Of course my favorites <br>are the writers.  And yes, I've iviewed <br>Joss.  He even fixed my tape recorder <br>for me.  He is a wonderful, generous <br>man, every bit as fun and bright as he <br>comes off when he posts.  It was a <br>distinct thrill to visit both the <br>productions, and it never wore off.<br><br>

<dd>There is going to be a third Buffy <br>Watcher's Guide.  I was asked to write <br>an essay for it but i was too busy doing <br>HEAT.  The essay that i originally <br>pitched ended up in SEVEN <br>SEASONS OF BUFFY by BenBella <br>Books.  There is also a second <br>Casefiles but i didn't work on it.  They <br>will be out soon.  I'm about to complete <br>an essay on Spike's character in <br>season 5 for BenBella.  And next week <br>i'm doing the keynote speech at <br>slayage, which is a gathering of <br>academics in Nashville.  So I get to <br>enjoy the Buffyverse for a while to <br>come.  <br><br>Thanks for the nice comments.  And <br>hey, Joss, thanks for the wonderful <br>years.<br><br>

<dd>Red, thanx.  I have a new B/A <br>crossover in June, called HEAT.  And <br>I'm doing a Buffy project right now. <br>Turned in a Tales of the Slayer about <br>Robin Wood's mom.  So there is more <br>print coming out.  They're not sure how <br>long they'll keep publishing.  It <br>depends on how sales go.  I had a <br>Spike-centric novel ready to go and <br>then news of the cancellation killed it.<br><br>

<dd>B/A print author Nancy Holder <br>dropping in.  There will be more books, <br>but it's hard to grasp that as far as TV <br>goes, it's all really over.  Thanks to all <br>the fans who tried so hard to save <br>Angel.  I loved the finale, which I <br>watched in the dark, all alone.<br><br>

<dd>Can't stay long.  Wanted to say thank you one more time, to all of you except anyone who ever criticized anything ever at all.  I came on these boards in Buffy's first year and the support -- and even the criticism -- has been more helpful than I can type.  I set out in television with one simple goal: to purchase a russian bride.  Didn't work out.  Immigration stuff -- it's complicated.  But I did get to make this show, and that other one, and that other other one, and meet some of the best artists and the best friends I've ever known.<br><br>I had dinner with Tim Minear the other night, and we talked about what kind of show we want to make next.  And it always comes back to the same themes... people getting strength.  People helping out.  People being thankful for whatever they have, be it power, a decent life, or a fun-tastic russian bride.  And I'm thankful that for the last eight years my cohorts and I got to feel like the superheroes.  'Cause of y'all.  I don't know if the Buffyverse is going to return to TV, but I hope so, and I know we'll be putting SOMETHING out there.  Maybe on HBO, 'cause I like me some cussin'.<br><br>Keep you posted.<br><br>-j.<br><br>
