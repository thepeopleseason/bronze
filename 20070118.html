<dd><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  I may have...  I get a lot of e-mails - and a lot of "announcement-type" e-mails in particular - and they all kind of run together sometimes.  So I don't really remember.  If it gets published, I'll definitely try and check it out, though!  :-)<br><br>OK, gotta go...  Have a great evening, everybody!<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Beldin</b>!<br><br><b>Menomegirl</b>: That's OK.  You're excused.  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>Menomegirl</b>:  Well, it's not a long run for a musical <i>per se</i>, but for an 8-shows-a-week union production here in LA, yes, it's pretty long.  (As opposed to all the 99-seat plan stuff out here, which doesn't pay, and usually just runs on weekends...I've been in a few of those, and they can run <i>forever</i>.)  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Sort of.  I'll be visiting my folks in Florida, who are nowhere near a beach, but who live in a lovely country-club-type community with a couple of big pools, tennis, courts, gym, etc. It'll be nice.  :-)<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>:  Well, hopefully 2006 didn't completely suck, then.  ;-)<br><br><b>Dianne:</b>  Congratulations!  That's fantastic.  The show is a new musical being done as a joint production of Center Theatre Group and Deaf West.  (Same folks who did the <i>Big River</i> revival that went to Broadway and was nomiated for the TONY.)  So, it'll have both deaf and hearing actors, and all new music written by this indie NY band called GrooveLily. It seems like it's going to be pretty cool.  :-)<br><br>OldManFan:  Well, I hope you canmake it!<br><br>I think you can buy tickets here:<br><br><a href="http://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/productiondetail.aspx?id=518" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/productiondetail.aspx?id=518</a><br><br>

<dd><b>Austin154</b>:  Thanks!  Yeah, I'm pretty   psyched.  The new show is going to keep me busy from Feb through May, so that's cool.<br><br>And on a personal note, I'm going on vacation next week!  Yay!<br><br>

<dd><b>Menomegirl</b>:  Things are great, thanks.  My jazz CD's still selling well, still working off an on at Disneyland, and I've got a new theater gig coming up in February, which I'm excited about.  :-)  <br><br>So many people I know had bad 2006's...I hope you have a great 2007.  I had a pretty awesome year last year, so personally, I'm just hoping 2007 is its equal.<br><br>
