<dd>THE END OF AN ERA!!!<br><br>I really felt the need to log on <br>and drop by, lurk and scroll and <br>all that good stuff....<br><br>Thanks JOSS, DAVID <br>GREENWALT AND JEFF BELL <br>and everyone for a wonderful five <br>years.<br><br>And thanks to THE BRONZE / <br>BRONZE BETA: this was a <br>fantastic and special place <br>indeed. Nice to know the hard <br>work is appreciated: this place <br>was not only fun but inspiring.<br><br>

<dd>Okay I still leave in the Grand Ty King tradition, but I DO have to work (or issue four of Astonishing X-Men will be three pages long, which I think is kind of not right.)   BUT:<br><br>Kiba.  You won't get lost.<br><br>And on the subject of Jordan Levin, i do want to say this much:  I'm not down with his decision and I never will be, but I've worked with jordan since the start of Buffy and he has always been a supporter and a decent guy.  His job is a soul-sucking nightmare.  And he's not prom king tonight, no sir, but he's part of why we got to have ten years total of shows on that network -- shows that wouldn't have lasted for... well imagine if they were on Fox.  So factor that in.  Later on.<br><br>

<dd>I'll stop by after it airs on this coast, but I did want to thank you all for what I just scanned... <br><br>and LI'L PIA -- the 711 reference caught my eye, so i figure you're the one drawing the best book in comics.  I hope Brian has conveyed my large love.  (And I knew that tim conway thing was gonna bite me in the ***...)<br><br>Does that count as a spoiler?<br><br>I'm actually a little overwhelmed.  I'm going back to work.  I will post more later.  -j.<br><br>

<dd>Thanks to all you fine, fine people for watching our little show.  The wonderful cast, crew, writers, and everyone else that worked so hard on Angel will miss each other -- and you guys -- very, very much.<br><br>I'm off to Fury's to watch the finale and shed a little tear for one damn fine piece of television.  Thanks for letting me play with all your cool toys, Joss.  You're the best.<br><br>For the last time:  Poof, I say, poof!<br><br>

<dd>Well, I must away.  Take care, all.  It's been fun.  Enjoy ALIAS next year with Bell and Goddard, SMALLVILLE with DeKnight and THE SHIELD with Craft and Fein.  <br><br>Ben Edlund and I will be opening a little ladies apparel boutique in Carmel next year.  Hope you'll all patronize our little shop.<br><br>;-)<br><br>

<dd>Irishrose - Ah, teenagers.  Now there's something really scary.<br><br>Kessie - Thanks for the wishes, Kes.  But I haven't taken any job.  I'm bumming it for a while.<br><br>Cassandra - Winner calls it.<br><br>FaithFan - Nothing you can do about Buffy animated except pray and keep the "Faith." ;-)<br><br>

<dd>Yep.  It's me.  Ran into a little technical difficulties trying to post, but Artie saved the day.<br><br>Just popped by to say so long, farewell and thanks for all the fish.<br><br><br>And to pick a fight if any of you punks want a go.  C'mon!  Yeah, I'm talking to you!  ;-)<br><br>
