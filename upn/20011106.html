<DD> Well. that's that, then. I can't tell you what a relief it is to have it
out there at last. The hugest undertaking of my life. I just feel
so... so... Hemnoy. You know what I mean?<br><br>

<dd> I just gotta give a thundering shout out to my kids. They inspire me,
they make me make them work harder, and they always come through. First
time I heard Tony sing it was at a charity function, I was cringing, he
was gonna sing "ever breath you take" to a tape, it couldn't go
well... ten seconds into it and, in the immortal words of a friend of
mine, I think I'm a little gay. He's the golden throat. And James, who
always tells me to do everything I dream of, then brings that intense
voice and those cheekbones along for the ride... Amber... just, you
know... Amber....<br><br>i mention those three in particular cause listening to them sing at my
house really did light the fire to write them a musical. But EVERYBODY
did such wonderful work, I can't even start. And not just the players --
wardrobe, lighting, set dec -- eveybody worked so hard on that ep, and
UPN went to the Fuggin' MATTRESSES to get it out there to people.  I'm
very grateful. With the love and the hugging and also the gayness, where
appropriate.<br><br>

<dd> Hey guys. Can't stay long -- it's late where I am. But wanted to holler
to my west coasties, hope it went over well.<br><br>Actually, what I'm truly frightened about is that my Film Professor
watched it with her class. I could be in huge trouble: the woman TAUGHT
MUSICALS, for God's sake! Must hide.<br><br>

<dd> in scrolling, I see my carefully worded shoutout to Ms NOXON never did
get put up here. so I'll reitereate: Do you know anyone that hot who can
run a show? Do you? I don't think so. What a voice. (This is the part
where I explain to Fury that he is also hot, yes very.<br><br>

<dd> Okay, enough of me. I'm pretty overwhelmed with the love here, thank you
all so much. I'll post again when my brain feels less like overcooked
bacon.<br><br>Whether or not tonight's ep worked, i know this much: Musicals will
never go away. They may hide, they may hibernate, but they endure. We've
had some great examples lately (South park, Oh Brother, Moulin Rouge,
Magnolia) and there's gonna be more. They're like a drug. Gotta have
'em.<br><br>Sleepage. ANd I did post some stuff over at the Beta about ep 8 and
whatnot. Lot's o fun.<br><br>yours ever, me.
