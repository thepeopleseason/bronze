<DD>Hey ho. <br><br>
Re: title, just wanted to say hi after another gruelling filming
experience. Except no gruel. Just film. Just the happiest filming
experience I could have had, doing episode 13 of Angel. (The other
show. It's on the Double you Bee - will this site explode if I plug it?
You know comma, I spend more time on Buffy, though I work hard on Angel
stories and cuts and all. Greenwalt and Minear (topplingly huge brains
to a man) have the show well in hand, and I hadn't even intended to
shoot one this year, so I don't see the crew much, and the cast only
socially.  But I got sucked into doing one and what a joy that set is
exclamation point! What a magical experience! And the episode centers
around EXACTLY the sort of thing our young male action-oriented audience
CRAVES: Ballet!<br><br>
Power has driven me mad!
