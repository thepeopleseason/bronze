<dd>wolfguard:  Top o' the evenin' to ya.<br><br>Icelord: And to you!<br><br>slayerdaddy:  Your footage looks great!  Some snippets may make the DVD.  Our performance that <br>evening wasn't one of the top of the last 10 years so I don't think any full songs will be there, though.  <br>Thanks!<br><br>ShadowQuest:  I don't have my iTunes drive hooked up to this comp right now but I believe it's "Kiss <br>me, <br>kill me  something something" *d'oh*.  I don't even know the lyrics on my own new record yet!   Thanks <br>for the kind words, BTW.  Remind me to check next time you see me on the board and I'll <br>decipher what I can.<br><br>Beldin:  The next comics I have on my list to read are Kenickie's Phonogram and Long Hot Summer.  <br>Hard <br>to find reading time (Dune is easy cuz I already know the story!).<br><br>Lisa_H:  Heya!  Deep into the holiday busy...<br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  Thanks for the James Taylor heads-up.  I just set the DVR.<br><br>Gotta jet for the evening (I'll try to get that "Sanctuary" stuff up before bed).<br><br>Check out my new solo CD, <b>That Sudden Stop</b> <br><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jymmthomas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  A perfect holiday gift (well, it's a nice <br>one anyway!).<br><br>

<dd>Hey Mar!<br><br>slayerdaddy:  If memory serves, you ran the <br>camera for us at the W&H party in 2004, <br>correct?<br><br>Beldin:  Alas, no Fray yet!  Don't tell anyone <br>but I've never read a Harry Potter book, <br>either (but I've seen all the films many times).  <br>I <i>am</i> reading the Dune books for the <br>first time as an adult (a lot goes over your <br>head when you're 12-14) so my sci-fi cred is <br>intact! *g*<br><br>

<dd>Beldin:  Thanks!  Anything that gets me back <br>in the comic store is a good thing.  Have to <br>check out the Fray stuff.<br><br>OldManFan:  Thanks for ordering!  They send <br>funny stuff on our end, too.  I love that they <br>are proudly indie.  <br><br>Christopher Marlowe:  I hear ya.  Guess what <br>my family is getting for Christmas? ;-)  <br>hint: it's round and shiny and I made it <br>myself.<br><br>

<dd>Hello Beta!<br><br>Been a long time and I'm sure a lot of you are like, "who the heck is this purple guy?", but this week has <br>seen two very cool events to trigger my return....Joss announcing the "Season 8" comics and the release of <br>my first solo EP titled <b>That Sudden Stop</b>.  It's available at CDBaby.com (the CD, not the comic!) <br>and is a limited edition release, signed and numbered by me.<br><br>Oh yeah, "who's this purple jerk?"...I'm Jymm Thomas, guitarist and co-founder of Darling Violetta who <br>composed and performed the theme to "Angel".  No, DV did not break up, we're working on record <br>number 4 and finishing the DV DVD (both of which are currently untitled).  The DVD will feature <br>performance footage from PBP 2003 and an earlier PBP pre-party, FYI.<br><br>You can listen to samples of <b>That Sudden Stop</b> (and buy it!)                                                      <br><a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/jymmthomas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>Good to be back!<br><br>

<dd><b>Thoin</b>: I have an extremely nice car, now, so I'm more careful.  :-)<br><br><b>Zeus:</b>  Hiya!  I'm great, thanks.  You should come see me in one of my musicals one of these days.    Do you get my e-mails about those sorts of things?<br><br>ETA:  I missed your post earlier, <b>Lisa H</b>!  Sorry about that.  I'm quite well, thank you.  Hope all is well with you, too.<br><br>
