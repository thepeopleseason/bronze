<dd>Some of you may have heard the hilarious news.  I thought this would be a good time to weigh in.  to answer some obvious questions: No, we had no idea this was coming.  Yes, we will finish out the season.  No, I don't think the WB is doing the right thing.  Yes, I'm grateful they did it early enough for my people to find other jobs.<br><br>Yes, my heart is breaking.<br><br>When Buffy ended, I was tapped out and ready to send it off.  When Firefly got the axe, I went into a state of denial so huge it may very well cause a movie.  But Angel... we really were starting to feel like we were on top, hitting our stride -- and then we strode right into the Pit of Snakes 'n' Lava.  I'm so into these characters, these actors, the situations we're building... you wanna know how I feel?  Watch the first act of "The Body."<br><br>As far as TV movies or whatever, I'm not thinking that far ahead.  I actually hope my actors and writers are all too busy.  We always planned this season finale to be a great capper to the season and the show in general.  (And a great platform for a new season, of course.)  We'll proceed ahead as planned.<br><br>I've never made mainstream TV very well.  I like surprises, and TV isn't about surprises, unless the surprise is who gets voted off of something.  I've been lucky to sneak this strange, strange show over the airwaves for as long as I have.  I don't FEEL lucky, but I understand that I am.<br><br>Thanks all for your support, your community, and your perfectly sane devotion.  It's meant a lot.  I regret nothing (except the string of grisley murders in the 80's -- what was THAT all about?)  Remember the words of the poet:<br><br>"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the road less traveled by and they CANCELLED MY FRIKKIN' SHOW.  I totally shoulda took the road that had all those people on it.  Damn."<br><br>See you soon.   <br><br><br><br>-j.<br><br>
