<dd><i>heading off to bed...it's been 10 years, <br>I'm getting old!</i><br><br>Hollyn:  The Midwest in spring...very nice.<br><br>Beldin:  Check 'em out.  Other than the <br>machine I described (hardware issue that <br>later models have fixed), I love Macs.  I'm <br>posting on my MacBook Pro right now.  Easy <br>for a tech-tard like myself to use! *g*<br><br>Ebdim9th:  =)<br><br>FSM CDMan:  "Dad" is now a married man.  <br>Have to drop him a line myself.<br><br>Good times today.  Old friends and new.  I <br>feel great!<br><br>

<dd>FSM CDMan:  Things are well.  I haven't been <br>to that store for a while.  I must go there <br>soon.  Your name came up a few times today <br>(in a good way!).  Wish you'd been there.<br><br>Ebdim9th:  I like the colors.  I was just saying <br>today that I used to post without to not <br>appear like I was "uppity" but the aesthetics <br>won out tonight! =)<br><br>Beldin:  Been there.  I just had to delve into <br>the guts of my iMac to solve a power <br>problem tonight.  I'm an admitted Mac-snob <br>(just because you don't have to know any <br>computer-ese to be a power user on them) <br>but that machine has been one problem after <br>another.<br><br>Hollyn:  Not to rub it in (like you know I do <br>on LJ!) but it's 63 degrees at 11:05 pm. <br>*basking in the Cali warm*  ;-)<br><br>

<dd>Beldin:  Sounds like fun!  I actually enjoy <br>doing comp stuff (but I'm a little strange <br>*g*).  DV is working on new stuff.  It's <br>starting to take shape.  My solo record is <br>available on iTunes (just type in Jymm <br>Thomas and it'll take you there).  There may <br>be a few physical copies left at CDBaby.com <br>(again, search for my name).<br><br>Ebdim9th:  Hello to ya! =)<br><br>Hollyn:  We missed ya today!  Come back to <br>the Golden State soon...and good luck on the <br>bar.<br><br>
