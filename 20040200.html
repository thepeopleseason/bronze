<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  That "one new label" you referred to is still interested, but they haven't even gotten off the ground yet.  With the industry in the kind of turmoil it's been in, the big money guy keeps hemming and hawing about pulling the trigger, you know?  But we'll see.  If the timing ends up working out, we may still end up going with them.<br><br>And CONGRATULATIONS!  I'm so happy for you.  That's really good news.<br><br>And yeah, I'll tell Jeff to get his head out of the studio everyone once in a while...like it'll do any good!  LOL<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin!</b>  OK, have to stay just long enough to chat with you.  =)<br><br>How are you?  Things are going great, thanks.  We've been getting interest from a few alternative-jazz type labels, but we're still in the very preliminary stages of shopping the new album, so we'll see what happens.<br><br>

<dd>Well, guys, I should get going.  Got lots of music to learn.  It was great fun chatting with you all, and I hope to see some of you at the Wolfram & Hart shindig...if I make it there, of course!<br><br>P.S.  For anyone interested in coming to see me in <i>George M!</i> while they're in town for the W&H party, we're running Thurs-Sun from Feb 19th through Mar 7th.  More info available at the <a href="http://www.fclo.com" target="_blank">Fullerton Civic Light Opera</a> website.<br><br>

<dd><b>valMichael:</b>  There sure are!  Among them are <i>Give My Regards to Broadway, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Grand Old Flag, Mary's A Grand Old Name, Harrigan</i>, and <i>Over There</i>.  And there are a ton more.  The whole show is all Cohan, all the time.  ;-)<br><b>OldManFan:</b>  I'm playing the real-life famous Broadway star of that time, Fay Templeton.  So, I'm singing <i>Mary's a Grand Old Name</i>, which apparently she introduced to the world by agreeing to sing it in one of his shows.<br><b>Shadow Quest:</b>  Hello!  Yep, that's me.  Lead singer and co-writer of Velvet Chain.  =)  Nice to meet you.<br><br>P.S.  Thanks, <b>OldManFan!</b>  An invite for me and Jeff would be awesome.  ('Cause then Jeff could go earlier and sort of schmooze around on my behalf til I get there. <i>*wink*</i>)<br><br>

<dd>Good evening, <b>wolfguard</b>.  Hope you are well.  =)<br><br><b>eirefairie:</b>  Hello, oh she of the pretty dress!  ;-)  Well, I haven't receievd an invitation or anything yet, but if I do, I will definitely try to stop by.  I have a performance of <i>George M!</i> that evening, so I wouldn't be able to get there til pretty late, but as I said, if I'm invited, I'll try to go.  You're going, I assume?<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Hello, and thank you, and yes they are!  =)  I was super busy doing theater and singing for various events and recording the new VC album such last year, and I'm in rehearsals right now for <i>George M!</i>, (a musical about George M Cohan), and I have a few small jazz concerts in the next couple of weeks.  My agent has been sending me out on tons of auditions and such, which keeps me busy, too, so things are good.  =)  How are you?<br><br><b>OldManFan:</b>  Well, cool!  I've only just started rehearsals, but the cast seems very talented.  Lots of really excellent tap dancers.  Fun stuff!<br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>valmichael!</b>  Wow, it's been that long?  The last year really flew by for me.  Which I guess is good, 'cause time flies when you're having fun, right?  =)  How have you been?<br><br>

<dd>Good evening!  I know I haven't been by in <i>ages</i>, but I just thought since I had a spare moment, I should come by, see who's around, and say howdy!  =)  So, HOWDY!<br><br>
