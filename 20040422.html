<dd>Okay team - gonna have to go.  But I'll try to get Stevie to come back here after episode twenty airs.  Meantime, try to keep your general awesomeness under control.  <br><br>Goddard out.<br><br>Oh wait, that sign-off's taken, isn't it?<br><br>Well then, how about:<br><br>  2 Cool<br>+2 Be<br>  4 Gotten<br><br>Or:<br><br>Party naked!<br><br>Or:<br><br>Have a bitchin' summer.<br><br>Or:<br><br>Lloyd, see you around.  Maybe.<br><br><br>Take your pick. <br><br>Next year we're totally gonna be seniors.<br><br>

<dd>That is touching that Foucault weighed in on the episode.  I'm glad you liked the episode, kind sir.  And may I just say I've always found your writings to be decidedly French.<br><br>

<dd>Okay, I'm back.  For the record, my mom thought tonight's episode was pretty good.  <br><br>My original title for this episode was "Nature vs. Nuture vs. Sahjahn." <br><br>I tell ya, things are gonna be different when I'm in charge.<br><br>

<dd>I just realized we haven't talked since the Posting Board Party.  Pretty good party, huh?  It was probably the third or fourth best time I've had holding Steve DeKnight's butt in a dirty restroom.<br><br>Mazzy - good to hear we share a brain.  Do you find your half is constantly thinking about Batman as well?<br><br>He's the Dark Knight.<br><br>Boothead - you missed the middle?  Don't worry, I can summarize it for you - Andrew has to kill a pig and then Spike punches through a wall and tries to eat him.<br><br>If my mom calls, I may have to jump off, but I'll be back.  It'll be nice to talk to her after she sees an episode about good parenting, you know, instead of an episode where she tries to have sex with me and then I kill her or an episode where I shoot my dad in cold blood and he's British.<br><br>

<dd>Okay -- so far, Superstare's winning the best taunt contest with "Drew Goddard owns your face."   <br><br>I didn't realize it, Superstare, but I do own their faces.  Damn right.<br><br>So... glad to see so many of you are liking Origin.  You humble me with your praise.  And let's direct some of it to Terrance O'Hara, Vincent Kartheiser and David Boreanaz - those boys really came to play on this one.<br><br>And James Marsters probably deserves some credit... and Amy Acker... and J. August Richards and Alexis - You know what?  This list is getting too long.  On second thought, just praise me.<br><br>After all, I own your faces.<br><br>
