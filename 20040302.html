<dd><b>Chistopher Marlowe:</b>  No worries.  I just don't get "nervous" very often, so that's why I was confused.  =)  Anyway, no, there won't be a cast album, as this is just a revival of an already well-established show.  And we close next weekend.  (Short run.)  But I wll try to get some photos posted at velvetchain.com at some point.  My wig alone is a scream!  ;-)<br><br>Well, I've got some stuff to do, so I need to get going.  Hope everyone has a nice evening!<br><br>~E.<br><br>

<dd><b>OldManFan:</b>  hehehe...  Well!  I wouldn't say that those are among my lost glamourous pics, but I don't look as bad as I could have, I guess.  Still...  OUCH!  *g*<br><br><b>Chistopher Marlowe:</b>  Hi, there!  Well, the musical's going great, thanks, and it's been very easy for me from the get-go, so I'm not sure what you mean.  Did I say I was nervous at some point?  Hmmmm...  I don't remember that, but maybe it was when we still didn't have our full set, and I was worried about the technical aspects of the show.  But honestly, my role in this show is such a cake-walk, I haven't been a whit worried about it at any point.  =)  (Unless you're thinking of "Madly In Love," the musical I did this past October/November?  I think I mentioned I was nervous for that one, since it involved some tap-dancing and was generally a dance role - stuff that I wasn't really used to doing.)<br><br>

<dd><b>eirefaerie:</b>  Hi, there!  Yeah, I was disappointed I couldn't make it, but there was really no way.<br><br><b>OldManFan:</b>  LOL!  Yeah, I was wondering if those photos would end up online anywhere.  Ouch!  ;-)<br><br><b>Thoin:</b>  Oh, well cool!  =)  Glad to hear you're enjoying it!<br><br>
