<dd>Thanks, <b>CM</b>!  G'night!<br><br>ETA:  Funny story about Tony, <b>ShadowQuest</b>!  I've done that sort of thing, myself.  I'm always poppping into foreign accents at wildly inappropriate times.  ;-)<br><br>I'm off, as well.  G'night!<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>  Close, very close, but <i>I'm</i> actually the one who says to the director, in Russian, something like, "30,000 meters?  But the U2 flies at 21,000 meters...  Is he purposefully giving us false information?" to which he replies that he (Oswald) doesn't know what he's talking about, and knows less than we (the Russians) do.  And before that whole scene, there's a separate one where I read back (in English) to Oswald/Sam his earlier statement to us - and this is <i>not</i> and exact quote: "I am willing to share all knowledge I have aquired of the United States military with the Soviet Union.  I herby repudiate my former country..." and I can't remember the rest.  (I'm amazed I remembered that much.  It's pretty fuzzy.)<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Well, actually, I am quite good at accents in general.  All I have to do is listen to the appropriate accent and I can reproduce it pretty well. Some accents take longer than others to master, of course, but generally I find it pretty easy to do.<br><br>As for Russian, that particular accent was already in my "bag of tricks" (as are various British accents, French, Italian, etc.), as I had only been out of college for 6 months when I auditioned for that role, and I had just taken Russian my senior year.  So I already could speak it -at least a little - and the accent was cake.<br><br>Long answer...hope it wasn't boring!  ;-)<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>:  Ding ding ding ding!  You are correct, sir!  =)  I spoke English with a thick Russian accent, and then I had a speech or two in Russian itself.  It was fun!<br><br>

<dd><b>Algerina:</b> Actually, the callback I have on Wednesday is for a straight-play, so that'd be - er - inappropriate.  ;-)  But I'll be sure to take that classic advice for my audition on Friday!  And thanks for the leg-breaking-wishes!<br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Yes, thanks for asking!  Unfortunately, I already found out that one of the things I was up for ended up going non-union (that is, they had a limited amount of Equity contracts to go around, and weren't able to use one on the role I was up for), but on the positive side, the producer called me personally to say how much they loved my work and to ask me to please keep auditioning for them (the theater company, that is), so that's nice, at least.<br><br>I have another callback this Wednesday, and a first audition on Friday.  Wish me luck!  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin</b>  Will do!<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  Well, that is either a lovely compliment, or possibly you feel that both the site and I are simply mediocre.  :-P  j/k  Thanks!  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin</b>   Thanks!  Glad you  liked it.  =)  And that sounds like a good weekend to me... <i>Samurai Jack</i> rocks!  And congrats on the new speakers.  No-one should have lame speakers, IMHO.<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>:  Again, I say: sounds like a lovely weekend!  I went to the library myself, today...  After stopping by my friend's house to see her new baby boy!  =)  (My friend Elizabeth, that is...  You know, Amy the Witch/Rat?  I just realized you guys know her, of course.  Duh.)  Mommy, baby, and hubby/daddy are all doing great.  YAY!!!!<br><br>ETA:  And of course <i>Dr. Who</i> rocks even more!!!<br><br>

<dd>Hi, guys!  First post on the new server.  ;-)  Just saying hi, really.<br><br>And of course, I echo the sentiments of <b>gargolye:</b>  I sincerely hope any and all Bronzers who may have been affected by Katrina are doing OK.
