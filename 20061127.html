<dd><b>Beldin</b>:  I am.  I sang (caroling) for two hours this morning, and had an audition (more singing) this afternoon.  It is 6pm after all.<br><br>

<dd>Hello again, everyone!  Hope all is well...<br><br><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  Just wanted to let you know that yes, I will be a guest "star" at the QL "Leap Back" convention in '09.  Thanks for the heads-up!<br><br>Please excuse the "commercial"-like quality of the rest of this post, but  most of the Bronzers' e-mail addresses I have on file are out of date, and I thought some of them might want to know about this:<br><br><b>I just wanted to remind you that as a special offer for the Holidays, we're including a copy of Velvet Chain's CD, "The Buffy EP" for FREE with every order of my solo jazz CD, "Come Rain Or Come Shine," from now through Dec. 24th!

<dd>Quick last post:<br><br><b>Beldin:</b>  OK, OK, point taken.  But when I tell him I'd like that for Christmas, he'll just say, "OK, great idea!  Why don't you go online and order it, OK?"  :-P<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  Well, yes, but since I do all the Christmas shopping anyway, and his money is my money is our money (old fashioned joint bank account and everything), what would really be the point?  ;-)<br><br><b>Menomegirl</b>:  Thanks!  You, too!<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  Well, I'll be buying that for myself for Xmas, I guess.<br><br><b>valMichael:</b> Amen!<br><br><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  I'll check it out.  Maybe if I contact them, we can work something out.  :-)<br><br><b>Maverick:</b>  I've actually  looked up the codes before online, and quite honestly, it always seemed like way too much of a pain to type all that crud in every time I wanted an accent, so I've never bothered to memorize the codes.  But if it makes you happy: Crudit&eacute;  (OK, I lied...I just copied and pasted <i>your</i> crudit&eacute;!  LOL)<br><br>

<dd>Thanks, <b>Jeanie TTF!</b> <br><br><b>Lisa H:</b>  Ugh.  I hate moving.  And no, I haven't started at all.  And my mom told me that she's already <i>finished</i> with hers!  Eek!<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  Awwwwwwww...  I don't quite know how to even reply to that!  I'm very flattered, of course, but more than that, I wonder why you'd think I <i>wouldn't</i> reply to your posts???  You  rock. (And I think I always reply to everyone, don't I?  At least I try to!)  :-)  Oh, and no, I haven't been contacted.  I probably won't be...I only ever did one convention for them, and my role was so small, really, I doubt anyone remembers me.<br><br><b>Shan:</b>  hehehe...   Cool.  <br><br><b>Maverick:</b>  Thanks for that!    And I don't know if it's come out yet.  I know it's supposed to, but I haven't gotten a check yet.  ;-)  I'll be buying it, though.  (I'll finally have a clean copy of the episode!  lol)<br><br>

<dd>Thanks so much, <b>Dianne</b>!  I will, don't worry.  On my birthday, for example, I'm only booked for a few hours during the day, so I'll be going out to a nice dinner with Jeff that night.  :-)  And I hope you have a wonderful Holiday season, as well.<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>:  My pleasure!<br><br><b>Menomegirl</b>:  Just type "crudite" into google.  A ton of recipes and info comes up.  (Even without the accent!)  :-) <br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b>  We have a repertoire of over 60 songs, which we perform in random order...either according to people's requests, or what we decide will work in a particular setting, etc.<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  lol...I'm sure you'll think of something.  And crudite (I still haven't learned how to type accents, so there should be an accent aigu over the last e) is just a nice word for assorted raw veggies with dip.  :-)<br><br>Hi, <B>Shan!</b><br><br>

<dd>Hi, <b>Lisa</b>!  I'm good, thanks.  Very busy, but good.  Between my stage show at Disneyland and my annual Christmas caroling gig, I realized that today was the last day off I will have until December 25th!  How are you?<br><br>

<dd><b>Beldin:</b>  Well, mine might not have been indolent, but it was still indulgent!  We had a pot-luck, and everyone really stepped up to the plate (so to speak).  Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, chips, dip, crudite, shrimp cocktail, choclate covered strawberries, cookies, several kinds of pie (with whipped cream), etc.  It was yummy!  I didn't even mind doing 8 shows!  ;-)<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>  Fantastic!  I hope you get what you  wish for!  hehe<br><br>Speaking of which, if anyone happens to be interested (and may be scrolling), here's the special offer we're referring to:<br><br>As a special offer for the Holidays, we're including a copy of Velvet Chain's CD, "The Buffy EP" for FREE with every order of my solo jazz CD, "Come Rain Or Come Shine," from now through Dec. 24th!
