<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>:  Thanks so much!  And I'd forgotten about your Leap-freakiness.  hehehe  I still have my original script from that episode...wonder if I could get anything for it on ebay?  ;-)<br><br><b>Maverick</b>: You have indeed.  Thanks so much.<br><br><b>Red Crayon</b>:  Well, even if I <i>did</i> have inside info, I certainly couldn't share it on a posting board!  We have to sgin confidentiality agreements and everything.  :-P  But thank you so much for the compliments...I really appreciate it!<br><br>

<dd><b>RedCrayon</b>:  I don't know yet what I'll be doing in September...  Hopefully I'll be in a show.  I'll let you know.  As for Disneyland, it's just a great place.  Definitely go on Space Mountain, Pirates of the Carribean, The Haunted Mansion, and Indian Jones.  (Indy's my favorite!)  Oh, and I love Peter Pan's Flight in Fantasyland.  It's very sweet.  It's a little kid's ride, but I love it.  I actually was working the day of the Pirates premiere, but I didn't stick around for it.  I just went home after my shift was over.  lol  And I'm not currently shooting any movies.  That trailer is for an indie film I shot a couple of years ago.  It was a finalist at the Hollywood Film Festival this past October, but it still doesn't have distribution or anything.  I'll let you know if and when you can see it. =)<br><br><b>OldManFan</b>:  Will do!<br><br><b>Maverick</b>:  I'm in the two-hour season premiere from the last season of the show.  It's called "Lee Harvey Oswald," and they always break it up into two episodes in syndication, so I'm not sure how it is on DVD.  I'm in both sections, though, so there ya go.  ;-)  I don't know that anything else I've done is rentable.  =(<br><br>

<dd><h1>Happy (Belated) Birthday, Kiba Rika!  =)</h1><br><br><b>RedCrayon:</b>  Yes, I am still the Evil Queen in the show, but sadly, you won't be able to see me when you come out.  The show closes on Sept 4th.<br><br>For those of you missed it (it just a little lower on the page), here, again, is a short video clip of me as the Evil Queen:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSMZaXcvta4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evil Queen!</a><br><br>

<dd><b>Christopher Marlowe:</b> Amen to that!<br><br><b>RedCrayon:</b>  Life's good, but it's too hot here.  Working at Disneyland, have a cool gig coming up at the Hollywood Bowl.  That's about it. =)<br><br><b>Maverick:</b>  Why, thank you!  Let's hope you're right!  hehehe  As for casting, they still cast things out of LA, but it's not that much of an issue for me, since I don't really do that much film work.  (Not that I don't want to, of course!)  Hopefully, I'll get a new TV/Film agent soon and I'll start going out for those sorts of projects again.  =)<br><br>Well, I'm tired, and the codeine's making it worse, so I'm gonna sign off now.  G'night!<br><br>

<dd>Christopher Marlowe:  It was that hot here, too.  And even with the air conditioning on (we have smallish window units), we can only keep it at about 85 degrees in our apartment.  Blech.<br><br>Maverick:  Why, thank you!  I alsmost didn't see your post to me, since you spelled my name with a "c" (it's with a "k"), and the first half is invisible, but I'm very glad I found it!  :-P  I'm very much looking forward to meeting all the <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> actors.<br><br>

<dd>Christopher Marlowe: I prefer having a principal role, but in a situation like this, where all the principal roles are going to be played by "stars" of some level, I'm just pleased to be involved.  =)<br><br>

<dd><b>slayerdaddy</b>:  Thanks a bunch!<br><br><b>Christopher Marlowe</b>  Oooh, sounds like a fun trip!  =)<br><br><b>Gray:</b>  Hi and thanks!<br><br><b>ShadowQuest:</b>  Well, I'll just be ensemble (basically an extra), but the exciting part is that the director (Peter Hunt, whom I've worked with before) has asked me and one other ensemble member (Tom Costello) to rehearse with the 3 leads for the week prior.  In other words, before the other stars get there, Tom and I will be reading all the other smaller roles with the actors playing Norma Desmond, Joe Gillis, and Max von Mayerling.  Should be fun!  I'm not sure who the three leads are yet, but I'll be sure to let you know when I find out!  =)  (I think Charles Durning may be playing Max...)<br><br>

<dd><b>ShadowQuest</b>:  I think you misunderstood me.  I don't doubt at all that what Tony said was true.  I ignore the negative stuff I hear <i>from</i> Con organizers <i>about</i> actors, musicians, etc.  You see?  ;-)<br><br>Thanks, <b>Old One</b> and<b> Menomegirl</b>!<br><br>

<dd>ShadowQuest:  Our experience with conventions has always been pretty positive.  But we haven't done <i>that</i> many...  The PBP's, of course, and Vulkon and CreepCon...  CreepCon wasn't 100% positive, but that was more because of the behavior one of the other acts on the bill the night we were playing than because of the organizer himself. I've heard stories of organizers badmouthing actors and acts after the fact...I think it's just a power-trip.  Makes them feel important.  I just ignore it if I hear anything.  I know the rumors that get spread are almost always untrue or at least hugely exaggerated.  (No matter whom it's about.)<br><br>I think it's great you're trying to do this!  But I know it's a huge undertaking...  I wish you all the best, and I really hope we get to come be a part of it.  =)<br><br>

<dd>valMichael:  Thanks!  Yeah, I'd never had surgery before, so it's all kinda new.  Career-wise, I'm working at Disneyland this summer playing the Evil Queen and the Hag in the <i>Snow White</i> show again (we close 9/4), and I'm also doing this cool "All-Star" staged reading of <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> (the film, not the musical) at the Hollywood Bowl on August 6th!  I'm really looking forward to that.  I don't know who all the "stars" are yet, but I do know that James Cromwell and Charles Durning are doing it.  =)  Other than that, there's not too much going on.  I'm auditioning, etc.  I was <i>really</i> busy in the first part of the year, doing all kinds of projects from theater to film to voice over work, but things always  tend to slow down over the summer, you know? <br><br>DaddyCatALSO: Awesome! Congrats!<br><br>

<dd>Hi guys!  Anyone even remember me anymore?  ;-)  I'm at home this weekend, recuperating (I had some outpatient surgery yesterday), and I thought I'd stop by.  How is everyone?<br><br>
